# 这位耶稣是谁 / Who is this Jesus (Open Forum)

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith.

He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. What we're going to do tonight is look at who is Jesus Christ. What you just heard depicted early dramatically was how the actions and the behavior of Jesus Christ has continually ignited debate about his identity.

And all thoughtful people will be part of that debate. I was a college student a long time ago, very long. My children occasionally over the years have asked me, Dad, when you were in college, did they have television?

Things like that. I used to say, no, honey. We used to entertain ourselves drawing pictures on cave walls of animals.

You can see some of them even today. I remember when I was in college, one picture that I've never forgotten. He was in 1970 during, I really don't know the history of this, but I know that during the Cambodian invasion and awful lot of the college campuses in the Northeast United States, shut down, students boycotted them basically because they wanted to talk about life issues, but where we were going.

And as a result, at least to the campus I was at, there was open mics on the college quadrangles every day. Anybody could get and speak, crowds of people showed up. No matter where you were, you saw groups of people together talking about the meaning of life.

And one set of students put up a sign. And on the sign, I remember it was black with white letters. And it said, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is intellectually credible and existentially satisfying.

And I've come to see over the years that those are the two tests of any valid worldview, of any valid philosophy, of any valid religion, the two tests. It has to be both rational, coherent, it has to be true, and it also has to be relevant, it has to meet my needs, it has to connect with my experience. Now modern people have a tendency when it comes to religion or to philosophy, not to ask the first question anymore.

I mean that really was 1970. Now all we ask is, oh religion, who knows whether it's true or not, does it work for me? Who knows whether it's intellectually credible, I mean after all, everybody's got their own views.

What I want to know is it's essentially satisfying to me. With all their respects, I think that's a dangerous approach. Because we do know something called a placebo effect, you know.

A placebo effect is this. If I am sick and I take some medicine that I really believe will make me better. But I have very serious symptoms, I'm dying of something.

There will be a placebo effect if I believe it enough. Some of my symptoms will go away. I will feel better.

But in the long run the placebo effect is very deadly. Because objectively, it can't do anything about my disease. And it might lull me into thinking, I'm fine, I'm okay, I don't have to do anything else.

If there is a spiritually objective universe. If I'm not saying that there is right now, I'm not trying to prove it to you. I'm just saying if there was a spiritually objective universe, every bit as objective as the physical universe.

Then to go into a religion or a faith or a worldview or a philosophy and everybody's got a working philosophy. Everybody's got a set of answers to what's wrong with us and where are we going and what is human nature and what is ultimate reality. Everybody's got a working philosophy.

If you go at it by saying all it matters is that I believe it, it feels great, it works for me. What if there is a spiritual placebo effect? What if it makes you feel okay?

You know, every single religion, every philosophy, even the craziest and the wildest and the most incoherent can produce people who say, I have joy in meaning in life now because of my adherence to this wonderful organization. Everybody, anybody can produce that. The mafia can produce that.

It's nice to have an income. It's nice to have brothers, brothers, sort of. What if there's a placebo effect?

What if you feel good for a while, but objectively, you're dying of something that this has nothing to do with, that this can't deal with. Don't you see how destructive that would be? Christianity is characterized by a willingness, almost a dare, a challenge to people to say, yes, we're essentially satisfying.

There's millions of people around the world who can say Christianity has helped me. Nobody denies that. That's a fact.

But Christianity challenges and says, but it's not just the works essentially satisfying. We're intellectually credible. We're relevant because we're true.

That's not the way the modern mindset goes. The modern mindset is, it's true if it works. Christianity says, oh, don't you see?

That'll be a placebo effect. We only ultimately work if we're true. Don't come to Christianity, says the Bible, because it's relevant, though it certainly is.

Don't come to Christianity because it's exciting, though absolutely it is. Don't come to Christianity because it'll meet your needs, though it certainly will. Come because it's true.

And because it's true, it'll meet your needs. It's exciting in this role. And if it's not true, it's a placebo.

Now, how do you know Christianity is true? That's quite a challenge. That's quite a dare, especially to do in a kind of confined period of time tonight.

And therefore, what I like to do is give you an overview of the main piece of evidence, which I think is overwhelming and inescapable evidence for the truth of the Christian message. And that is Jesus Christ as datum. Jesus Christ as fat.

Who is He? You see John 9 that you just heard depicted. Jesus deeds were always making people come up with theories.

Did you hear the theories? This man is a sinner. Wait a minute, says somebody else.

You know, I've never seen sinners do this kind of thing before. This man is a prophet, but is that enough? And at the end, Jesus Christ says, I'm the one who healed you and the blind man gets down and worships Jesus.

Worships. Did you hear that? Worships.

And what does Jesus do? He takes it. He stays put.

Who is this guy? What kind of person would take worship? Huston Smith wrote a great book called The World's Great Religions.

It's an old book. It's been around a long time. You know, a staple of religion courses, a terrific book.

The world's great religions. And in that book he says, there have only been in the history of the world two prominent and influential figures whose lives were so incredible and so tremendous. The data of their lives was so inexplicable that people around them did not just ask, who are they?

Who are you? But what are you? Huston Smith has only two people that really have had influence in the history of the world whose lives were marked with such beauty that people didn't just say, who are you?

They asked, what are you? Those two people were Buddha and Jesus. And Smith points out that responses of those two people were completely opposed, completely opposite.

In both cases, people wanted to worship them because they'd never seen compassion. They'd never seen integrity. They'd never seen lives like that.

They'd never seen beauty. They'd never seen wisdom. They'd never seen anything like it.

And Smith says, people, what are you? And they wanted to worship. And Buddha said, absolutely, don't worship me.

I am not a God. Buddha always and continually said, don't look to me. Look to my Dharma, my doctrine, my teaching.

Don't look at me. Look at my Dharma, my doctrine. Jesus, unequivocally accepted worship.

Jesus, not only unequivocally did not say, I'm not God, he unequivocally said, not even I am a God, he said, I'm the God. And whenever anybody worshiped, when Thomas fell down and said, my Lord, my God, when the blind man worshipped, Jesus stood there and calmly took it. One of the things that is so inexplicable about Jesus is this.

There's a lot of people, there's at least 20 people, that we can say are the most influential people, figures in the history of the world. In fact, Jesus would also probably be in any group of the 10 most influential figures in the world. In fact, you could probably put Jesus in the three.

In fact, it might even be a consensus to say he's the single most influential, but he's in that fraternity. He's in that group. On the other hand, there have also been a number of people who have claimed to be divinity.

They've claimed to be God. They've claimed to be divine personages, but there is no overlap between them except one guy. Because the people who have made claims of divinity have always been unable to convince anyone but a group of marginalized, you know, off-balanced, frag-tag little group of disenfranchised people, that they are God.

Oh, there's been dozens of them. I am God, worship me. There's been dozens of them.

And they've never convinced anything but a small group of unbalanced people. On the other hand over here, you've got a whole bunch of people who have been the most influential folks in the history of the world and in almost all cases when they talk about themselves, there's a humility. Don't look to me, says Buddha.

Look to my Dharma. They always say, don't worship me. Don't do that.

That's what made them great. That's what made them influential. Except one guy.

There's one guy in both categories. One man who not only made incredible claims, but also got people to believe. And if one of the most influential figures in the history of the world claim to be God himself, claim therefore the absolute allegiance of every human being on the face of the earth.

There is no thoughtful person. There's no thoughtful person who can possibly walk away from that without studying it. You can't say I've had a balance and I've a thoughtful approach to life.

I'm not a Christian. I don't believe all that stuff about Jesus being God. But you see, I haven't studied a whole lot.

I was raised in it, but I pretty much, you know, I had religion 101. I had philosophy 101. I pretty much realized most of the smart people and most of the cool people around me didn't believe this either.

So I didn't either. Friends, the magnitude of Jesus claims and the magnitude of his impact shows that you better not just doubt that he is not God. God, you better know that he's not God.

The magnitude of the claim. Look, what if you got on very official stationery from one of the major law firms in New York City, you got a letter saying please come see us. You are a long lost heir of the British throne.

What is your first reaction? Come on. I'm Chinese.

Come on. It can't be. And yet, you know, you know, you're not even going to make a phone call.

I'll give you another one. Let's just say you get official stationery from the IRS and it says you owe us $400,000 in back taxes and you say, I can't be. I haven't made $40,000.

How could this be? And yet, you see the magnitude of the claim. The magnitude of the claim means that you better not just doubt that it's true.

You better know it's not true because if there's a chance, it's true and you miss it, your life is ruined. When Jesus Christ says, I'm the way the truth in the life. No one comes to ultimate reality, but by me.

You better know that that's not true. He was a crackpot. You see, I mean, I don't think everybody has to study the life of David Kuresh because what if he really is who he said he is.

There's an awful lot of other people like him that I don't think that we've got that much evidence, you know, to back up his claims. But here's one, one, one person who's made these kinds of claims and look at the impact of his life. The data, the data of Jesus Christ.

Have you looked at it? Now, let me show you what the data is. And then let me show you there only five.

I'm just going to tick through them because this is basically the case. Maybe you've never seen an overall case. The case for Christianity.

The case for Jesus being who he said he is. Look at the data and there's only five possible answers, five explanations. Who is this?

I've just shown you that no intelligent person can fail. To look at the data and decide which of these five options you believe. Because if you don't even try, if you just ignore it, if you say, well, I don't know, I haven't looked at it.

What's a matter with you? Your life could be ruined if you're wrong. The magnitude of the claim.

Look at the data and there's only five ways to explain it. Here's the data. Number one, there was a man some 2000 years ago in Palestine who claimed to be God, who claimed to be the Messiah, the Son of God from heaven, who claimed to be bringing the kingdom of heaven to earth.

Number one, number two, as he went about with this message, the people who heard him speak saw him do things that looked like miracles. They saw him apparently feed 5000 people from a little loaf of bread or two. They saw him walk on water.

They saw him raise people from the dead. They saw him heal people who are sick. That's number two.

I'm not telling you that he did do miracles. I'm telling you that hundreds of people saw him do apparently what were miracles. It created an incredible sensation.

John 9 that you just heard depicted for you is just one example. Number three, he not only claimed to be God, but he convinced the people who are closest to him, the people who lived with him, the apostles, and so on that he was God. Keeping in mind that the last people on the face of the earth who could possibly believe that a human being could be God would be first century Jews.

Because on the east, their understanding of God in the east is God is sort of a life force that's in everybody and everything, so it's not that unusual to say a person is kind of a manifestation of God. On the west, the Romans and the Greeks had this understanding of God's, and there were a lot of gods and they used to take on disguises and they used to appear as human beings to make whoopee for a while. I mean that you can see it in the myths, but the Jews, the Jews had a view of the transcendence of God unmatched in any place else in the world at the time.

The Jews had an understanding of a God who was not just imminent but transcendent, a God who was above the world, who had created the world, who was beginningless. And the Jews had been taught in the first two commandments of the Ten Commandments that have been taught for 2000 years, never, ever, ever worship anything created, never, never worship a calf, never worship the son of the moon, never. They had been instilled in them for years and years and years, they didn't even use the name of God.

It was too holy, the last people in the world who would believe that somebody was God would be a group of first century Jews, but not only that, the last people in the world who believe your God are the people who you sleep with. Hey, there's all kinds of these great heroes right, everybody likes them, and then outcomes the people who live with them, somebody gives them a book contract, somebody writes an article. And this is the reason why there are hundreds of people in this column who believed in God, they were God, who said they were God, but who never had any impact.

Why? Because basically there's always somebody who sees the cruelty, somebody who sees the selfishness. Somebody who sees the duplicity, somebody who sees the hypocrisy, the last people who you'll ever get to believe that this person is God, are the people who you live with, who you sleep with, who you work with.

Fact number three, the group of people surrounding Jesus Christ, not only heard his claims to be God, they believed it. Number four, after he died, dozens and hundreds of people confessed and attested that they saw him risen. Not only did all the apostles, but we know that at least 500 people at one time, Paul tells us this in the book of 1 Corinthians, we'll get to that in a second.

At one time, saw him risen. That's fact number four, dozens, dozens of people. Sometimes hundreds at a time said, I've seen him, he's not dead, he's risen.

Fact number five, the experience of that changed those men and women's lives so much that they went out into the world and they died to spread the news. Many of them sacrificed tremendously. Many of them suffered a martyr's death, but they were so completely transformed that they went everywhere and they spread the faith all around the Mediterranean five things.

There was a man who claimed to be God, he did apparently miracles, he got the people close to him to believe that he was God. After he was dead, many people saw him risen and those people were so transformed by the experience of meeting that risen savior that they spread the word everywhere. How do you account for the facts?

How do you account? How do you account for the data who he is? You got to come up with something and there's only five possibilities and I'll just tick through them.

I will tell you, the first two are impossible. The first two options are impossible. I won't even say impossible because I'll call them options.

There's five options, the first two are impossible, the second two are improbable, the last one's inescapable. They all start with I. The first two, the first two, the first one.

Most people in New York get out from under the data this way so I've got at least spent a couple minutes on this. Most people say he's a legend. We don't know that any of that happened.

That's the average way that New York people get out from under it. Here's what I mean. In other words, I come to you like I said and many of you here tonight, I'm hoping that afterwards we can talk and have a question answer time after the program is over and so on.

You might come back with me at this but I would say most people I would say how do you account for that data and you say how do we know who Jesus was? How do we know he claimed to be God? How do we know he did parent miracles?

How do we know all these things? Don't you know that Jesus Christ like any charismatic individual? His followers were amazed with him and so after he died they began to weave tales about him and weave stories about him.

And you know you played whisper down the alley having you you know you say it to one person next person and over the years these tales became embellished. And the early church began to put into these tales they began to make up stories and they began to put words in Jesus' mouth that met their needs. And so finally they were written down in the New Testament many years after but they were written by the people who were Christians, they weren't their biased people.

They wrote these things down many years later and so we have no idea what Jesus really said. We don't know which of these things are genuine, we don't know which of these accounts is genuine, you can't read the New Testament history. He was a legend that's how I get out from under the data.

Let me just give you actually three reasons that can't be. And this would be a great talk on itself but I just have to give you three reasons why it can't be. Number one, the Bible is not written as legend, the Bible's written as history.

We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to gospel in life this month will send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith.

It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com slash give. Again, that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. A lot of people like to say, well you know, I mean look at the legends around Buddha, look at the Buddhist writings, look at the Korean, look at these writings but here's a difference.

When you go, for example, to the New Testament, you go to take a look at the gospel of Luke. And in the very beginning of the gospel of Luke, Luke says this. He says many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life just as they were handed down to us by the eyewitnesses.

So I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning and I've written an orderly account so that you may know the certainty of these things. How would he say? He is saying look, I wasn't an eyewitness, but I know a lot of the eyewitnesses.

So I have carefully gone and interviewed the eyewitnesses. This is a guy writing like an investigative journalist. He says I went and I interviewed the eyewitnesses.

I've compared the various accounts. I have woven them together into an orderly account so you can be certain that these things happen. Another critic, a literary critic puts it this way.

He says when you read the New Testament, you can see right away the gospels are not written as legends. In one sense, he says they're not good enough. And that, listen, and he's trying to say they're not good enough.

Here's what he means. He says if they are not history, then they would have to be realistic prose fiction of a kind which actually never existed before the 18th century. Little episodes like in John 8, Jesus writing in the dust when they brought him the woman taken into adultery.

Those little kinds of things that have no particular significance in the story at all are the mark. See what he's saying? He says today we have fiction that's like the novel.

That's realistic prose fiction. It goes into detail. It says she came to the door.

She turned the knob. You know, it creeps. That's the way we write fiction now.

This person said if the gospels with all of their detail, with little statements like when Jesus received the woman called adultery, he was writing in the sand. Doesn't tell us what he was writing. It has nothing to do with the plot.

Nothing to do with the story. Legends don't put those kinds of little details in. The critic is saying they didn't write fiction like that.

Luke says this is not a legend. Luke doesn't write it as a legend. And therefore, when you read the New Testament gospels, you have to assume that they are either absolutely deliberate intentional hoaxes.

They're lies or their historical accounts. There is no in between. Are you ready to say that?

Now, that's the first step. And getting rid of this idea that Jesus was a legend because the second step is this. They're either history or their lies.

If their lies try these two things on. Up to about 1900, many scholars said, ah, you know the gospels, they weren't written until 100 years after the events. Research and archaeology over the last 80 years has pushed it back, pushed it back, pushed it back.

So all scholars now will say that the gospels were written around 70 AD. And you know, you have the epistles of Paul were written within 20 years after the events. And this is what's in that mean.

It means something very important. If you're going to fabricate. If you're going to create stories and say this happened and this mountain and this happened and this happened in this year and this happened in this year, the only way you're going to get that to fly is if you wait till all the eyewitnesses are dead.

In 1970, on my college campus, when we shut down the place so that we could debate the Cambodian vision and the morality of it, nobody was going around with a camcorder. I didn't think we had them. We did have movies, but we didn't have camcorders.

Nobody sat around and made an account. So there's really no historical accounts. But if I decided now, 23 years later, which is as long after the events of Jesus' life as Paul was when he was writing his epistles, if I decided to write that there was a riot on my college campus during the strike and that seven or eight people were killed, that would never get off the ground.

There's just too many people around who are alive, some of them are dead, but most of them are alive. And they would say, what are you talking about? I read the review of this book and the New York Times book review, forget it.

They can't be. They'd be up in arms, out they'd come. If you want to fabricate something, you've got to wait until after all the eyewitnesses are dead, so there's no possibility of corroboration or contradiction.

All of the New Testament documents, just about all that we know, were written within the lifetime of the eyewitnesses. How could they be absolute and total intentional lies? Paul says in Thessalonians 15, 500 people saw Jesus Christ raised from the dead at one time.

They saw him alive. He wrote that 20 to 25 years, everybody agrees with this, all scholars agree, after the event. Here's a public letter.

This is public knowledge. How could a faith be based on these kinds of accounts when there would have been hundreds of people back there who could have said, what do you mean the tomb is not empty? Look, there's the tomb.

What do you mean those things never happen? Where are these 500 people? I don't know if any of them.

Could it, you see, it's Campy Legend, it's either a lie or it's historical document. And does it make sense that it is a lie? Not, you know, not because it was written too early, but lastly, do people die for hoax?

Think of the disciples. All of them would have been had to be in tremendous conspiracy. Do they die for hoax?

Kenneth Scott Latteret, who was a tremendous historian, lived and he worked at Yale, he put it this way, at one point. He says, why among all the cults and philosophies competing in the Greco-Roman world, did Christianity succeed and outstrip all others? Why did it succeed despite getting more severe opposition than any other?

Why did it succeed though it had no influential backers and high places, but consisted mainly of the poor and slaves? How did it succeed so completely that it forced the most powerful state in history to come to terms with it and then outlive the very empire that sought to uproot it? It is clear, he concludes, that at the very beginning of Christianity there must have occurred a vast release of energy, perhaps unequal in our history, without it the future course of the Christian religion is inexplicable.

It is a possibility that all these people died for a lie, maybe possible, absolutely, but put that together with the idea of when it was written. The Christian faith on the basis of these claims could never have gotten off the ground. They couldn't have said the tomb is empty unless the tomb wasn't empty because of when they were saying it.

They couldn't have said, people saw Jesus raised from the dead unless they had seen Him raised from the dead because those people were still there. They couldn't have talked about the miracles. They couldn't have said, this Jesus claimed to be the Son of God unless He had claimed to be the Son of God.

I'm sorry, you can't say. He's a legend. You can't say.

Well, somebody says, if I keep reading newspaper accounts, if it says scholars say we have no idea what Jesus Christ is actually, what Jesus Christ really taught and what He said. Yeah, I know. By the way, they very often put themselves forward as mainstream historians and they're not.

They're very, very skeptical and let me just put it this way. If you doubt on the basis of historical evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said all these things, you have to doubt and you have to say we can't know anything from the past. You have far more, far more evidence that Jesus Christ didn't said these things than you have evidence that Caesar invaded Gaul.

Far more. We only have one account of that. We have four accounts of this.

The only account we have is a manuscript, the earliest copy, 900 years after the event. The gospels we have, we have manuscripts from just within a few years after they were written, but here's the difference. There's a bias.

When you study Caesar's Gallic Wars, you don't sit down and say, I wonder if this is true because if it is, it'll change the way in which I have to live. It doesn't matter whether Caesar's Gallic Wars are true or not. Not the way you have to live, but who in the world can come to the gospel and see the account and be objective.

Don't you know what is wrong with saying, ah, yes, as a scholar, I can read the New Testament objectively. You can't. Nobody can.

Nobody can. Because if it's true, unlike Caesar's Gallic Wars, you will have to change the way you live tomorrow. You have lost control of your life if it's true.

You've got to do what he says. You've got to live your life for him. You can't live the way you feel is right or wrong.

You have to find out what he says. You have to follow him. Who in the world could possibly be objective studying that?

Imagine a judge and she's about to hear a case about a particular company and the prosecution is trying to say this company is guilty of fraud. What if that judge was a major investor in that company? What if that judge, if the company was found to be fraudulent, would lose thousands of dollars?

Common sense and the laws of this land would say she has a vested interest, she's conflict of interest, she cannot hear the case. But when you read the Bible and you sit down and say one of these things are true or not, you have even more conflict of interest than she does. If this is found to be true, you stand to lose control of your whole life.

And if you know that you've got that conflict of interest but you have to study it anyway and you have to make a decision, there's no other way around it. You better make sure that you double and triple check every one of your doubts because they could be prejudice. You have to double and triple check every one of your bits of skepticism because you know you have a tremendous motive to not believe it.

And that's the reason why I would tell you, so many scholars will be skeptical of the historical account of Jesus and won't be skeptical of what Caesars got like wars, Herodotus, all those accounts, waitonious and so on. He's not a legend. Now if he's not a legend and the second impossible option is he couldn't be a good man, he couldn't be.

Do you know what he says? Have you read what he says? People like to say, oh, but he was just a fine teacher.

How could he be a fine teacher? He says, I'm the way the truth in the life. No one comes to the Father but by me.

He says, if you want to follow me, if you want to be my disciple you have to hate your Father and Mother. He says, anyone who wants to lose his life, save his life will lose it, but anyone who will lose his life for my sake will find it. He says, all power is given unto me and low I'm with you always the end of the earth.

You know what he's saying? Let me just give it to you in modern language. He says, I'm the only way to ultimate reality.

I am the ultimate reality. He says, if you want to follow me, you have got to give me everything. Your love for me must be so high that your love for anything else, even parents and children and spouses has to look like hate in comparison.

If there's anything keeping you from me, if it's an eye, throw it away, pluck it out. If it's a hand, cut it off. Get rid of it.

It's not worth losing me. All reality, all the universe will bow to me. All things will bow to me and all things will bow to you if you come to me.

Who has ever said things like this before? I'll tell you one thing, no good person would say this. This person is either God or he's on the level of a poached egg, a man who says he's a poached egg.

He's either God or he's a terrible liar, but he can't be a good man. Reject him, hate him, assassinate him. But none of this nonsense that he's a good man.

He's not a legend, he's not a good man. Then we say, ah, well, maybe he was a liar or maybe he was a lunatic. But there's a couple of problems with both of those and I'll just treat them together to get to the end.

Mainly because both the liar option and the lunatic option are both the same option. In other words, you're saying he fooled his followers. He was either a very bad person like the Pharisee said in John 9, or he was really a lunatic.

We've got a bit of a problem there. Here's why. For example, look at the quality of his teaching.

It's not the ravings of a madman. GK Chester didn't put it this way. If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock.

If I found a key on the road and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock at my house, I'd assume most likely that the key was made by the lock maker. And if I find a set of teachings set out in pre-modern Oriental society that has proven itself of such universal validity, that it has fascinated and satisfied millions of people in every century, including the best minds in history and the simplest hearts. That it has made itself at home in virtually every culture, inspired masterpieces of beauty in every field of art, continues to go rapidly and spread and assert itself in lands where a century ago the name of Jesus Christ was not even heard.

If such teaching so obviously fits the locks of so many human souls in so many times and so many places, are they likely to be the work of a deceiver or a fool? In fact, it is more likely that they were designed by the heart maker. Well, then take a look at his life.

Look at his life. We see the account. Is that life a life of a liar or a lunatic?

Someone's put it this way. No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said. The account.

You try to come up with a better line. Do you realize what kind of person you have to be to even make this up? If somebody made this up, we would have to be sitting here having the same kind of discussion over who is this incredible person who made it up?

What kind of person would this be? No one has ever yet discovered the word Jesus ought to have said or the deed he ought to have done. Nothing he does falls short.

In fact, he is always surprising you and taking your breath away because he's better than you could imagine. Why? They are the surprises of perfection.

He combined virtues never seen together, tenderness without weakness, strength without harshness, humility without the slightest lack of confidence, holiness and unbending convictions without the slightest lack of approachability, power without insensitivity, passion without prejudice, the harshest judgment on the self-satisfied, yet the most winsome kindness to the broken and the marginal, never inconsistent, never a false step, never a drawing note. P. T.

Forsyth said, If God be not thus, he is less than the God we crave and less than the God the world needs. This is the holy love that deserves to be almighty. Listen, when we describe it, we're done.

When we describe it, even describing it, can't you begin to feel a little bit of what they saw? The reason they got down and worshipped him? You can see it when you read the gospels.

You can see it as we just described it. They felt they knew that they were looking through the substance of a human flesh, the very being of God. The last people in the world who would believe this were 1st century Jews.

What power could have gotten them to believe it? What's the alternative? St.

Thomas Aquinas put it this way. He says the only alternative is to believe even greater miracle. And that greater miracle would be, if Jesus Christ did not happen and even more unbelievable miracle happened, the conversion of one half of the Roman world and their moral transformation into unsolficionist and new heights of holiness all by the biggest lie in history.

What's the inescapable option? Not a legend, can't be a good man, those are the impossible ones. The improbable ones, a deceiver or delusional.

Where does it bring us? It brings us to this place. If you get rid of your bias against this possible supernatural, if you get rid of your bias against the idea of a miracle, if you get rid of that bias, it's hard to believe who he said he is, but it's harder not to.

It's difficult to believe who he said he is, but the theories that you have to adhere to in order to get out from it are even more species and have even more holes. And as a result, we come to the final and we say he must be who he said he is. If that's true, it means number one.

It means that there is no way that you have really met the real Jesus unless your reaction to him has been extreme. If there's anybody in this room who doesn't hate him or on the other hand, fear him. I think he's the most dangerous person that ever lived or on the other hand, there's three hands on this man here.

Or on the other hand, love him, adore him and he's thrown over everything to follow him. Those are the only three alternative responses that are rational. Don't you see?

Because of his claims. You should either hate him and attack him or you should fear him and run from him or you should love him and bow down before him. But if you have said, well, I don't know what I think or I think I'm a Christian.

I wish I was a better Christian. I don't know if I'm a Christian. You don't know who he is.

You have never seen the real Jesus. You're responding to a figment of your imagination. Get real.

Lastly, if Jesus is who he said he is, it's great news. You know why? Because he's saying morality and goodness is not the way.

See, Buddha says, I am not God. Look to my teaching. If you just live a good life, that'll be enough.

But if on the other hand, if on the other hand, if on the other hand, you see Jesus who says, don't look to my teaching. Look to me. Buddha says, I'm not God.

I show you the way to God. Jesus says, I'm God come to you. You will never be good enough.

You will never be moral enough to reach God. I have come to live the life you should have lived. I've come to die the death.

You should have died to pay for your sins. I've come all the way. Believe in me.

See, Buddha says, this is the way. Jesus says, I am the way. Buddha says, I can show you the way to God.

Jesus says, get real. You'll never get there. You'll never be good enough.

I'm God come to you. That's good news. If you understand what I just said, and you're not a Christian tonight, you better ask yourself, since I have lots and lots and lots of conflict of interest, I have lots and lots and lots of fears that make me prejudice against the truth of it, please agree tonight to explore.

Some of you think everything I said is silly. I hope you come back some other time anyway. I hope you'll think about it.

Some of you are surprised. Some of you say, I need to study more. Some of you are saying, I need to get more into this.

My stereotypes have been shattered a little bit. I've gotten new ideas to think about. I'm convicted in some ways.

I would like you, if you can, after the service is done, to stick around for a question and answer time, and or go to the welcome table afterwards, out front, get a little blue piece of paper that will give you a book called, Who Is This Jesus? This is for people who want to know. People who aren't sure who he is.

People who are guests tonight, go out, fill out one of those forms, take it downstairs these lounge, and you'll get a free book of the same title of the talk tonight. What we're going to do now, I'm going to pray, we're going to hear a piece of music, and right after that I'm going to take just two or three questions from people to get our question and answer time started. Then I'll dismiss all of you and the people who need to stay can stay up front here and we'll have a question and answer time right afterwards.

Let me pray with you. Our Father, we close this time with prayer because we know that like Jesus said to the Pharisees, because you don't think you're blind, you're very blind. And because you haven't admitted that you don't see, you don't see.

But if you admit you don't see, you begin to see. And if you admit your prejudice, you're losing your prejudices, I pray that your spirit will help people to see that they don't see, so that they can begin to see. And you will get people here, a Holy Spirit, to help people to see their prejudices so they can drop their prejudices so that we can see whether or not Jesus Christ is existentially satisfying and intellectually credible.

I ask that your spirit would help everybody here to see that in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with others. As you may know, August is Goen's share month at gospel and life. We believe God uses small acts to do great things.

If you've already taken a step, maybe you've shared a resource or started praying for someone, we'd love to know. You can encourage others by marking your location on our Goen's share map. Just go to gospelenlife.com slash share and let us know you've participated.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。你在信仰上有多开放？本月的播客中，提摩西·基勒将探讨圣经关于公开信仰的观点。他向我们展示了在一个多元化的社会中如何以一种促进文明、和平和有意义对话的方式公开谈论我们的信仰。

今晚我们将探讨耶稣基督的身份。你刚刚听到的早期戏剧化描绘了耶稣的行为和举止是如何不断引发关于其身份的辩论的。所有有思想的人都会参与这场辩论。我很久以前还是个大学生，我的孩子们偶尔会问我：“爸爸，在你上大学的时候，他们有电视吗？

”我说：“没有，亲爱的。我们常常在洞穴墙上画画动物来消磨时光。” 你可以看到一些至今仍然存在的画作。我记得在我上大学时，有一张我永远忘不了的图画。

那是1970年期间的事情，具体的历史我不太清楚，但我知道当时美国东北部许多大学因为要讨论生活中的问题而关闭了校园，学生们罢课。结果，在我们所在的校园里，每天都有开放麦克风活动在学院广场举行。任何人都可以上去演讲，成群的人前来听讲。无论你在哪里，都能看到一群人聚在一起谈论生命的意义。

有一组学生挂了一块牌子。我记得牌子是黑色的，上面写着白色的大字：“耶稣基督的复活在理智上可信，在存在上令人满意。”多年来，我逐渐认识到这两个标准是对任何有效世界观、哲学或宗教进行检验的两个关键点：它必须合乎逻辑、连贯，并且真实；同时也要相关，能够满足人们的需求并连接他们的经验。现代人倾向于在面对宗教或哲学时不再提出第一个问题了。

我指的是那确实是1970年。现在我们所问的只是，哦，宗教，谁知道它是否真实？对我有效吗？谁知道它是否在智力上站得住脚？

毕竟，每个人都有自己的看法。我想知道的是，它对我来说本质上是令人满意的。尽管如此，我认为这是一种危险的方法。因为确实有一种叫做安慰剂效应的东西我们知道。

安慰剂效应是指这样的情况：如果我生病了，我相信某种药物会让我好转。但我的症状非常严重，我可能正在死于某种疾病。只要我相信足够多，就会有安慰剂效应，一些症状会消失，我会感觉好些。但从长远来看，安慰剂效应是非常危险的。

因为它客观上无法治疗我的疾病。它可能会让我以为自己没事了，一切都好了，不需要做其他事情了。如果有一个精神上的客观宇宙。我并不是现在说这个，我没有试图证明给你看。

我只是在说，如果有这样一个客观的精神宇宙，就像物理宇宙一样客观。那么进入一种宗教、信仰、世界观或哲学时，每个人都有自己的工作哲学。每个人都有一套关于我们的问题、我们的去向、人性和终极现实的答案。每个人都有一个工作哲学。

如果你只是说这唯一重要的是我相信它，感觉很好，对我有效。那如果有一种精神上的安慰剂效应呢？那会不会让你觉得一切安好？你知道，每一种宗教、每一个哲学，甚至是那些最疯狂、最荒诞、最不连贯的，都能产生这样的人：他们因为追随这个美妙的组织而感到生活有了意义和目的。

每个人都能做到这一点。黑手党也能做到。有收入很好。有兄弟也不错。

如果有一种安慰剂效应呢？如果你觉得一段时间内感觉良好，但客观上你却因某种与这无关、也解决不了的问题而濒临死亡，你不觉得这样很毁灭吗？基督教的特点在于它几乎是在挑战人们说：“是的，我们本质上就是满足。” 世界上有数以百万计的人可以说基督教帮助了他们。

没有人否认这一点，这是事实。但是基督教挑战并宣称：不只是行为上的满足。我们在智力上是有说服力的，在现实中有意义，因为我们是真的。这与现代思维模式截然不同。

现代思维模式认为：“如果它有效，那就是真的。”而基督教则说：“你没看到吗？” 那将是一种安慰剂效应。我们只有在真实的情况下才能真正起作用。

圣经说：不要因为基督教有用就来信仰它，虽然它确实有这个效果。不要因为基督教令人兴奋就来信仰它，虽然绝对如此。不要因为基督教能满足你的需求就来信仰它，虽然它确实能这样做。要因为你相信它是真的才来信仰它。

因为它是真的，所以它能满足你的需求。它在这个角色上是令人兴奋的。如果它不是真的，那就只是安慰剂。那么，你怎么知道基督教是真的呢？

这是一个很大的挑战，也是一个很大的挑战，尤其是在今晚这种有限的时间内。因此，我喜欢做的是给你一个主要证据的大致概述，我认为这是无可辩驳、无法逃避的基督教信息真实性的证据。那就是耶稣基督作为事实。耶稣基督作为救主。

他是谁？你刚刚听到约翰福音9章的描述。耶稣的行为总是让人们提出理论。你们听到了这些理论吗？

这个人是个罪人。有人反驳说：“等等，他可能是个先知。” 你知道，从没见过罪人做这种事。这个人可能是先知，但这够了吗？

最后，耶稣基督说：“我是治愈你的人。”瞎子下来就拜耶稣。拜了。你们听见没有？

拜了。而耶稣做了什么？他接受了。他保持沉默。

他是谁？什么样的人会接受崇拜呢？霍顿·史密斯写了一本很好的书叫《世界伟大宗教》。这是一本古老的书，流传了很长时间。

你知道吗？它是宗教课程中的重要读物，一本极好的书。世界上的伟大宗教中，这本书里说，在人类历史的长河中，只有两位人物的生活如此非凡、如此巨大，以至于他们生命的事实是如此难以解释，以至于周围的人都不只是问：你是谁？而是问：你是什么？

亨特·史密斯指出，历史上真正对世界产生重大影响的两个人物就是释迦牟尼和耶稣。而这两人对待崇拜的态度截然相反。在两种情况下，人们都想要崇拜他们，因为他们从未见过如此慈悲、如此正直的生活，也从未见过这样的美丽、智慧或任何类似的东西。史密斯说：你们是什么？

人们想要崇拜。而佛陀却说：绝对不要崇拜我。我不是神。佛陀总是不断地说，不要看我，要看我的法，我的教义和教导。

不要看我，要看我的法，我的教义。耶稣则明确接受了人们的崇拜。不仅耶稣没有说他不是神，他还明确地表示，连他自己都不是神，他说他是神。每当有人崇拜时，无论是托马斯跪下喊“主啊，神啊”，还是瞎子崇拜时，耶稣都平静地接受了这种崇拜。

耶稣身上最不可思议的一点就是这一点。有很多人可以被称为历史上最有影响力的人物之一，至少有20个人。事实上，耶稣很可能也会被列为世界十大最具影响力的十个人之一。实际上，你甚至可以把耶稣放在前三名。

事实上，可能达成共识的是他是最有影响力的人，但他属于这个团体的一部分。另一方面，也有一些人声称自己是神。他们自称是神，自称是神圣人物，但除了一个例外之外，在这些人之间没有任何重叠。因为那些宣称自己是神的人总是只能说服一些边缘化、失衡的小团体，也就是一些被边缘化的弱小群体。

哦，这样的例子有很多。我是神，请崇拜我。这样的例子有很多。他们从未说服过除了一小群不正常的人以外的任何人。

相反，在这里，你们有一大群历史上最有影响力的人物，而几乎在所有情况下，当他们谈论自己时，都表现得很谦逊。不要看我，佛陀说。看看我的法教。他们总是说，不要崇拜我。

不要那样做。正是这一点使他们伟大，使他们有影响力。除了一个例外之外。只有一个男人同时属于这两个类别。

他不仅做出了惊人的声明，还让人们相信了这些声明。如果历史上最有影响力的一个人声称自己是神，并因此要求地球上每一个人都向他效忠， 那么没有一个有思想的人可以不研究这个而不被说服。你不能说我已经平衡过，我对生活采取了一种深思熟虑的态度。我不是基督徒，我不相信耶稣是神。

但是你看，我没有深入研究过。我是长大的环境影响下接受的宗教教育，但基本上，我只上了宗教入门课和哲学入门课。我基本上意识到周围大多数聪明的人和酷的人都不相信这个。所以我也不信。

朋友们，耶稣的声明及其影响力之大表明，你最好不只是怀疑他不是神。神啊，你必须知道他不是神。声明的规模。想想看，在非常正式的信笺上收到一家纽约主要律师事务所的来信，说请来见我们，告知你是英国王室的一位远亲。

你的第一反应是什么？我是中国人。来吧，这不可能。然而，你心里清楚，你甚至都不会打个电话。

再给你举一个例子。假设你收到了IRS的正式信笺，上面写着你欠了40万美元的滞纳税，你说：“我不可能。”“我没有赚到4万美元。” 怎么会这样呢？

然而，你得明白这个要求的规模。这个规模意味着你不能仅仅怀疑它的真实性。你必须确定它是假的，因为如果有可能是真的而你错过了，你的生活就会被毁掉。当耶稣基督说：“我是道路、真理和生命。

除了我，没有人能到父那里去。” 你最好确定这不是真的。他是疯子。确实，我认为每个人都不必研究大卫·库里斯的生活，因为我们不知道他是否真的是他说的那个人。

然而，这里有一个这样宣称的人，看看他的生活产生了多大的影响。耶稣基督的数据。你看过吗？现在让我告诉你这些数据是什么。

然后我会告诉你只有五个解释。我将简单列举一下，因为这基本上就是整个案例。也许你从未见过关于基督教的整体论据。关于耶稣是否如他所说是那个人的论据。

看看这些数据，只有五个可能的答案。他是谁？我已经向你们展示过，任何一个明智的人都不可能忽视这些数据并决定相信哪个选项。因为你如果连尝试都不愿意，只是选择忽略它，或者你说：“我不知道，我没有看过。

” 你怎么可以这样呢？如果你错了，你的生活可能会被毁掉。这个要求的规模。看看这些数据，只有五个解释方式。

这是数据：第一点，在大约2000年前的巴勒斯坦，有一个自称是神、是弥赛亚、是天之子，并声称要将天国带到地球上的男人。1. 第一，第二，在他传讲信息的时候，听他讲话的人看见了他所行的一些看似奇迹的事。他们看见他从一点点的面包或两块饼中喂饱五千人。他们看见他在水面上行走。

2. 他们看见他使死人复活。他们看见他医治病人。这是第二点。3. 我不是在告诉你他确实做了奇迹，而是在告诉你数百个人亲眼目睹了他所行的看似奇迹的事。

这引起了巨大的轰动。4. 刚才你听到的约翰福音9章就是一个例子。第三，他不仅声称自己是神，还说服了最亲近他的人——与他同住的使徒们等相信他是神。考虑到在地球上最后可能相信一个人可以成为神的是第一世纪的犹太人这一点。

5. 在东方，他们对神的理解是神是一种存在于每个人和每样事物中的生命力量，所以可以说某个人是某种神的表现并不奇怪。而在西方，罗马人和希腊人的观念中有很多神，并且这些神会以人类的形式出现来取乐一阵子。你可以从神话中看到这一点，但犹太人对神的理解却是独一无二的。6. 犹太人认为神不仅是无所不在的，更是超越世界的，是创造世界的存在，是没有开始的。

他们通过《十诫》前两条诫命已经教导了两千多年：永远不要崇拜任何被造之物，永远不要崇拜牛犊，永远不要崇拜月亮的儿子，等等。这些教义已经深深植根于他们的思想中，以至于他们甚至不用神的名字。它太神圣了，世界上最后一个会相信有人是神的人群，大概就是一世纪的犹太人了吧，但不仅如此，最后一个相信你神的人，竟然是你同住、同床共枕的人。嘿，这些伟大的英雄人物大家都知道吧，人人都喜欢他们，然后那些和他们一起生活的人，有人给他们写书约，有人为他们写文章。

这就是为什么在这篇文章中会有几百个人声称自己是上帝的原因——他们确实自称是上帝，但却没有任何影响。为什么呢？因为基本上总有人会看到残忍的一面，总有人会看到自私的行为，总有人会看到虚伪和伪善。你永远无法让那些与你同住、同床共枕的人相信这个人就是神。

事实三：围绕耶稣基督的那群人不仅听到了他自称是神的说法，他们还信了。第四点，在他死后，有几十甚至几百个人声称见过他复活。不仅是所有的使徒，我们还知道至少有一次500多人同时见证了这一点——保罗在《哥林多前书》中提过这一点，我们一会儿再讲到。有一次，500多人同时看到了他复活。

这就是事实四：有时是几十人，有时是几百人在场说：“我见过他，他没有死，他已经复活了。” 第五点，这些人经历了这一切后被彻底改变，他们为了传播这个消息而走遍世界，甚至不惜牺牲生命。许多人付出了极大的代价，有些人甚至为信仰献上了生命的最后一刻，但他们都被彻底改变了，所以他们无处不在地传播着这一信仰。有一个人自称是神，并且确实做了奇迹，他让身边的人相信了这一点。

在他死后，很多人声称见过他的复活，这些人因为遇见这位复活的救主而被彻底改变，于是他们四处传扬这个消息。你如何解释这些事实呢？你如何解释？你如何解释他是谁的数据？

你必须给出一个说法，而这种说法只有五种可能。我将一一列举。我要告诉你，前两种是不可能的。前两种选项根本不可能，我甚至不会说它们是“可能”的，我会直接称它们为“选项”。

有五个选项：前两种是不可能的，后两种不太可能，最后一种是不可避免的。它们都以“I”开头。先讲第一种，再讲第二种。大多数纽约人都用这种方式摆脱这些数据，所以我至少已经花了几分钟在解释上。

大多数人会说他是传说中的人物，我们不知道那些事情是否真的发生过。这就是纽约人通常的做法。换句话说，我今晚像之前一样来见你们，希望之后我们可以进行问答环节。你们可能会跟我一起探讨这个问题，但大多数人的回答是：你如何解释这些数据？

我们怎么知道耶稣是谁？我们怎么知道他声称自己是神？我们怎么知道他行了奇迹？你怎么知道这些事情？

难道不知道耶稣基督和其他有魅力的人物一样吗？他的追随者被他所震撼，在他死后他们开始编织关于他的故事。你知道，就像玩“悄悄话”游戏，你告诉一个人，下一个人再传给另一个人，随着时间的推移，这些故事变得越来越丰富。早期教会把这些故事写下来，并在耶稣的话语中加上符合他们需求的内容。

最终，许多年后才把这些内容记录在新约圣经里。但这些书是基督徒写的，他们可能是有偏见的。这些事情是在许多年后被记录下来的，所以我们不知道耶稣究竟说了什么。我们无法确定哪些言论是真实的，也无法确定哪段记载是真实的。

你不能从新约历史中读到真相。他是传说，这就是我如何摆脱这些数据的方式。让我给你们讲三个不能成立的理由。这本身就是一个很好的话题，但我必须给出这三个理由。

首先，圣经不是传说，而是历史。我们总是说福音改变了一切，并且我们相信确实如此。这也是为什么在《福音与生命》八月分享福音月期间，我们在邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，向生活中上帝为你安排的人分享福音。对于本月向《福音与生命》捐款的朋友，我们将赠送两本《理解上帝》（Making Sense of God）一书，作者是蒂姆·凯勒。

这是一份强大的资源，探讨了基督教如何在今天的世界中从情感、文化和理性层面做出解释。这是对您捐赠的感谢，并提供了一种方式，您可以与朋友一起阅读这本书，或者送给同事，甚至将两本书都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人。这是一种开始或继续福音对话的简单方法。要获取您的两本《理解上帝》，请访问 gospelandlife.com/give。

再次强调，网址是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒博士剩余的教学内容。很多人喜欢说：“你看，比如佛教周围的传说、佛教文献、韩国的这些文献……”但这里有一个不同之处。例如，当你去读新约圣经时，你可能会翻阅路加福音，在福音书开头，路加这样写道：许多人已经把耶稣的事迹写下来，按照他们从目击者那里听到的内容。

我仔细调查了这一切，并以有序的方式编写了这本书，使你们能够知道这些事情的真相。他在这里说了什么？他是在说：“我不是目击者，但我了解很多目击者。” 所以我去采访了那些目击者。

这是一位像调查记者一样写作的人。他说：“我去采访了那些目击者。” 我已经比较了各种记载，并将它们编织成一个有序的叙述，使你们能够确信这些事情确实发生过。另一位批评家，一位文学批评家是这样表达的。

他说当你阅读新约时，你马上就能看出福音书不是传说。从某种意义上说，他认为它们不够好。他想说的是它们不够真实。这是他的意思。

他说如果这些故事不是历史事实，那么它们就应该是18世纪之前从未存在过的那种现实主义小说。比如约翰福音第八章中，当他们带耶稣来处理那个犯奸淫的女人时，耶稣在地上写字的小插曲。那些对故事情节毫无意义的细节就是标志。你看他在说什么？

他说现在我们有像小说那样的虚构作品。那就是现实主义小说。它会详细描写。比如她来到门口，转动门把手。

你知道，这很恐怖。这就是我们现在写小说的方式。这个人说如果福音书里有所有这些详细的描述，比如当耶稣接受那个被指控犯奸淫的女人时，他在地上写字，但没有告诉我们他写了什么，与故事情节无关，与故事本身无关。传说不会加入这样的细节。

批评家认为他们没有写过这种虚构作品。路加说这不是传说。路加不把福音书当作传说来写。因此，当你阅读新约的福音书时，你必须假设它们要么是绝对故意的骗局，要么就是历史记载。

没有中间地带。你们准备好了吗？现在这是第一步。摆脱耶稣是传说这个想法的第二步是这样：要么是历史事实，要么是谎言。

如果它们是谎言，请尝试这两点。直到大约1900年，许多学者认为福音书是在事件发生后约100年才写成的。过去80年的研究和考古学已经将时间推前了，又推前了，再推前了。所以现在所有的学者都会说，福音书是在公元70年左右写的。

你知道，保罗的书信在事件发生后大约20年内就写好了。这就意味着什么。**这意味着非常重要的一点。**如果你要编造故事，说某事发生在某个山头，在哪一年发生了什么事，唯一的办法就是等到所有目击者都去世了，你才能让这些故事站得住脚。

1970年在我大学校园里，当我们关闭学校进行柬埔寨愿景及其道德性的辩论时，没有人拿着摄像机四处拍摄。我认为那时还没有摄像机。我们有电影设备，但没有摄像机。没有人坐下来记录这一切。

所以实际上并没有历史记载。但如果我现在决定，在距离耶稣生平事件23年后——这和保罗写信给提摩太的时间差不多——我决定写下在罢课期间我的校园里发生了一场骚乱，七到八人被杀，那这个故事永远不会成立。因为太多的人还活着，有些人已经去世了，但大多数人仍然活着。他们会说：“你在说什么？

我已经读过这本书的书评和《纽约时报》的书评了，别说了。”他们不会相信。他们会站起来反对，出来反驳你。如果你想编造一些东西，你就必须等到所有目击者都去世之后。

新约的所有文献，我们所知道的大部分内容，都是在目击者的有生之年写成的。这些故事怎么可能全是故意的谎言呢？保罗在他的《帖撒罗尼迦后书》15章中说，在一次事件中有500人同时看到耶稣基督从死里复活。他们亲眼见到他活着。

他在事件发生后的20到25年内写了这封公开信，所有学者都同意这一点。这是公开的知识。如果一个信仰基于这种记载，而当时有数百人在场，他们怎么可能说：“你说坟墓没有空？你看，那就是坟墓。

” 那些事情真的没有发生过吗？那500个人在哪里？我不知道他们中有谁。这可能是坎佩传奇，要么是谎言，要么是历史文献。

难道说它是谎言合情合理吗？不是因为写得太早了，而是最后一个问题：人们会为了一个骗局而献身吗？想想门徒们吧。他们都必须参与一个巨大的阴谋才能做到这一点。

他们会为一个骗局而献身吗？肯尼斯·斯科特·拉特雷特是一位杰出的历史学家，在耶鲁大学工作过，他曾这样说过。他说，在希腊罗马世界的各种教派和哲学中，为什么基督教能够脱颖而出并超越所有其他教派？为什么它能够在面对比任何其他教派都更严峻的反对声中取得成功？

为什么一个没有显赫支持者、主要由穷人和奴隶组成的团体能够取得如此巨大的成功，以至于迫使有史以来最强大的国家不得不与之妥协，并且在试图铲除它的帝国灭亡后仍然存活下来？他得出结论，在基督教最初的阶段一定发生了某种巨大的能量释放，可能在我们的历史上从未有过。如果没有这种能量的释放，基督教未来的发展就无法解释。所有这些人都为了一个谎言而献身的可能性是存在的，也许有可能，但将这一点与文献写作的时间结合起来考虑，基于这些主张建立的基督教信仰绝不可能成立。

他们不能说坟墓空了，除非坟墓真的空了，因为这是他们在说的时候的情况。他们不能说人们看到耶稣复活，除非他们自己亲眼见过，因为那些人还在那里。他们不能谈论奇迹。他们不能说这个耶稣声称是上帝的儿子，除非他确实声称过他是上帝的儿子。

抱歉，你不能说他是传奇。有人会说，如果我不断阅读报纸上的报道，学者们都说我们对耶稣基督到底说了什么、教了什么一无所知。是的，我知道。顺便提一句，他们常常自诩为主流历史学家，其实不然。

他们非常怀疑。让我这样说吧：如果你根据历史证据怀疑耶稣基督没有说过这些话，那你就要怀疑一切过去的事情，你拥有的关于过去的证据远比凯撒入侵高卢还要少得多。我们只有一份关于凯撒入侵高卢的记录，而关于耶稣基督的话，我们有四份记载。唯一能提供的资料是一份手稿，最早的副本是在事件发生后900年才出现的。

但福音书的情况不同，我们有在它们写作后的几年内就存在的手稿。然而这里有一个关键区别：存在偏见。当你研究凯撒的《高卢战记》时，你不会坐下来想，如果这些是真的，那我明天的生活方式就得改变。凯撒的《高卢战记》是否真实与否，并不直接影响你的生活方式。

但福音书不一样，谁能够客观地阅读那些记载而不被影响呢？难道你知道作为学者说可以客观地阅读新约圣经吗？没有人能做到。没有人能做到。

因为如果它是真的，与凯撒的《高卢战记》不同，你明天的生活方式必须改变。如果你相信了它，你就失去了对生活的控制权。你必须照他所说的去做，为他生活。你不能按照自己认为正确或错误的方式来生活。

你需要找出他说的话，跟随他。世界上有谁能够客观地研究这些呢？想象一下一个法官即将审理一家公司的案件，控方试图证明这家公司犯了欺诈罪。如果这位法官是那家公司的主要投资者，并且如果公司被判定为欺诈，她会损失数千美元，这会发生什么？

常识和这个国家的法律会说她有利益冲突，不能审理此案。但当你读圣经，坐下来思考这些事情是否真实时，你甚至比她还更有利益冲突。如果事实证明这是真的，你可能会失去你整个生活。而且你知道自己有利益冲突，但仍必须研究它并做出决定，别无选择。

你最好确保每一点怀疑都经过双重和三重检查，因为它们可能是偏见。你也必须确保每一个疑点都经过双重和三重检查，因为你知道你有很大的动机不相信这些事情。这就是为什么我要告诉你，许多学者会对耶稣的历史记载持怀疑态度，但不会对恺撒的战争、希罗多德等人的记载持怀疑态度。他不是传说。

如果他不是传说，那么第二个不可能的选择就是他不是一个好人。你知道他说了什么吗？你读过他的哪些话吗？人们常说，哦，但他只是一个优秀的教师。

他是怎么成为优秀教师的呢？他说：“我是道路、真理和生命。没有人能到父那里去，除非是经过我。” 他又说：“如果你愿意跟从我，如果你想要做我的门徒，你必须恨你的父亲和母亲。

”他还说：“任何人要救自己的命，就要先丢掉它；但为我的缘故舍弃生命的，这人将在生命中获得保存。因为在我这里，人若找到生命，必会丧失生命；若为了我而舍弃生命，这人必会在生命中获得。” 他又说：“所有权柄都赐给我了。”“我要常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。

” 你知道他在说什么吗？让我用现代语言告诉你。他说：“我是通往终极现实的唯一途径。” 我是终极现实。

他说：“如果你想跟从我，你必须把一切献给我。你对我的爱必须如此之高，以至于对你其他任何事物——甚至父母和孩子、配偶——的爱都显得像仇恨一样。” 如果有什么东西阻碍了你跟我在一起，哪怕是一只眼睛，也要把它摘掉；哪怕是一只手，也要把它砍下来。舍弃它。

这不值得失去我。整个现实，整个宇宙都会向我屈服。如果你来到我这里，所有事物都将向你屈服。有谁说过这样的话吗？

我可以告诉你，好人绝不会这么说。这个人要么是神，要么就是个煮熟的鸡蛋，一个说自己是煮熟的鸡蛋的人。他要么是神，要么是个大骗子，但肯定不是个好人。拒绝他，恨他，诋毁他。

但他绝不可能是个好人。他不是传说中的人物，也不是个好人。那么我们说，嗯，也许他是骗子或者疯子。但是这两种说法都有问题，我一起处理一下，直接讲到重点。

主要问题是这两种说法本质上是一样的。换句话说，你是在说他欺骗了他的追随者。他要么像约翰9章中的法利赛人所说的那样是个非常坏的人，要么就是个真正的疯子。这里确实有个问题。

为什么这么说呢？来看一下他的教导质量吧。这不是疯子的胡言乱语。GK切斯特没有这样说过。

如果我在路上发现一把钥匙，发现它能打开我家某个锁，我最有可能会认为这把钥匙是锁匠做的。同样地，如果我们发现一套在前现代东方社会中提出的教义，这些教义具有如此普遍的有效性，能够吸引和满足数百万跨越各个世纪的人们，包括历史上最杰出的头脑和最简单的心灵；它已经扎根于几乎每一个文化之中，在艺术的每一个领域激发了无数杰作，并且继续迅速传播并影响那些一个世纪前甚至不知道耶稣基督名字的土地。如果这样的教义如此明显地契合了那么多人类灵魂在不同时间和地点的需求，它们更有可能是欺骗者的还是傻子的作品？事实上，它们更像是心灵的设计师所创造的。

那么再来看看他的生活。看看他的生活。我们有记录。这是一场骗子或疯子的生活吗？

有人曾这样说过：没有人找到过耶稣应当说的那句话。这记录。你试着想出一句更好的台词。你能意识到要编造这个，需要什么样的人吗？

如果有人编造了这个故事，我们在这里讨论的一定是那个不可思议的人是谁？这个人会是什么样的呢？没有人找到过耶稣应当说的话或应当做的事。他所做的每一件事都无可挑剔。

事实上，他总是让你惊讶得喘不过气来，因为他比你能想象的更好。为什么呢？因为这些是完美的惊喜。他结合了从未见过的美德：温柔而不软弱，坚强而不粗暴，谦卑而毫无自信缺乏，圣洁和坚定信念而不失亲近感，力量而不冷漠，激情而不偏见，对自满的人最严厉的评判，却对破碎和边缘人最吸引人的怜悯。

从不矛盾，从不出错，从无虚假。P. T. 菲斯说：“如果上帝不是这样，祂就比我们渴望的神更逊色，也比世界需要的神更逊色。”这就是值得全能的圣爱。听我说，当我们描述它时，我们就完成了。

当我们描述它时，即使是在描述它，你是不是也能感受到一点点他们所看到的东西？为什么他们会跪下来崇拜他呢？当你读福音书时，你可以看到这一点。正如我们刚才描述的一样，他们感觉到自己透过人的肉身看到了神的本质。

最不可能相信这个的人是1世纪的犹太人。什么力量能让这些人相信呢？有什么替代方案吗？托马斯·阿奎那这样说过：唯一的替代就是相信一个更大的奇迹。

而那个更大的奇迹将是，如果耶稣基督没有发生，甚至更难以置信的奇迹发生了——半个罗马世界的道德转变和他们的道德提升到无罪的高度，这一切都是历史上最大的谎言带来的转化。什么是不可避免的选择？不是传说，也不是一个好人，这些都不可能。不可能的选项，要么是骗子，要么是精神错乱。

这会带我们去哪里？它把我们带到这个地方。如果你摒弃对这个超自然可能性的偏见，如果摒弃对奇迹想法的偏见，如果摆脱了这种偏见，要相信他所说的他是谁，其实更难；但要不相信，就更加困难。要相信他所说的他是谁，确实很难，但是为了从中解脱出来而必须坚持的理论却更多漏洞。

因此，我们最终得出结论：他一定是他说的那个样子。如果是这样，那就意味着： **这意味着除非你的反应极端，否则你不可能真正遇到真实的耶稣。**如果房间里有任何人既不恨他也不怕他，我认为他是有史以来最危险的人；或者相反，这个人有三个特点。或者相反，爱他、崇拜他，并为了追随他而放弃了一切。

这三种理性的回应是唯一的可能。你不明白吗？因为他的声明，你必须要么恨他并攻击他，要么害怕他并躲避他，要么爱他并向他屈服。但如果有人说：“我不知道我怎么看，或者我想我是基督徒。

” “我希望我能成为更好的基督徒。” “我不知道自己是不是基督徒。” 那么你就根本不知道他是谁。你从未见过真实的耶稣，只是在回应你的想象。

清醒一点吧。最后，如果耶稣是他说的那个人，那真是好消息。你知道为什么吗？因为他说道德和善良不是方法。

你看，佛陀说：“我不是神，请遵循我的教导。如果你过着好生活就足够了。” 但如果他确实是那个说“不要看我的教导，要看我”的耶稣；如果他说“我是通往神的道路”，而佛陀又说“我不是神”。我给你指明通向神的路。

耶稣却说，“我是神来到你们这里。”你永远达不到足够的道德水平。你永远不会达到足够好的程度去接近神。我已经来过并活出了你应该有的生活，已经替你受了该受的死。

你应该为你的罪而死。我来就是为此。相信我吧。你看，佛陀说这是路；耶稣说，我是那条路。

佛陀说，我可以带你到神那里去。耶稣说，别做梦了。你永远到不了那儿。你永远达不到那个标准。

我是上帝来到你们中间。这真是好消息。如果你能理解我说的话，并且今晚不是基督徒，那你最好问自己一句：既然我有很多利益冲突，很多恐惧让我对真理有所偏见，请你今晚同意探索一下吧。有些人觉得我说的都是胡说八道。

我希望你们将来还会回来考虑一下。有些人感到惊讶；有些人说，我要再研究研究。还有一些人说，我要更深入地了解。我的一些成见被打破了。

我得到了一些新的想法来思考。我在某些方面受到了感动。如果可以的话，请大家在礼拜结束后留下来参加问答时间，或者去前面的欢迎台领取一张蓝色小纸条，上面写着《他是谁？耶稣》这本书的名字。

这是给那些想了解更多的人准备的。今晚是客人的朋友们，出去填一份表格，拿到楼下休息室，你们会得到一本同名的小册子。我们现在要做的是祈祷。我们来听一段音乐，然后我将回答一两个问题开始我们的问答时间。

之后我会让大家离开，需要留下来的朋友可以留在前面，我们会马上进行问答环节。让我们一起祷告吧。我们的天父，我们在结束时要祷告，因为我们知道，就像耶稣对法利赛人所说的，你们以为自己不瞎，其实非常瞎；因为你们没有承认自己的无知，所以你看不见。但是如果你承认自己看不见，你就会开始看见。

如果你承认自己的偏见，你就正在失去这些偏见。我祈求圣灵帮助人们认识到他们没有看清事实，从而能够开始看到真相。这样，圣灵会帮助人们认识并放下他们的偏见，使我们能够判断耶稣基督是否在存在上令人满意，在思想上具有可信度。愿你的圣灵帮助这里每一个人看清这一点，奉耶稣的名我们祷告。

阿门。感谢你们今天聆听这堂教导。愿你们被激励，并且能将福音应用到生活中去，与他人分享。正如你们所知，八月是《福音与生命》中戈恩分享月份。

我们相信上帝用小事成就大事。如果你已经迈出了一步，或许你已经分享了资源或为某人祈祷，请告诉我们。你可以通过在我们的戈恩分享地图上标记你的位置来鼓励他人。请访问 gospelenlife.com/share 并告知你已参与。
