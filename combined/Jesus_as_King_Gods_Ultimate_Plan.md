## 没有王，生活看似混乱 / Life Looks Chaotic Without a King

If you were to take a person out of the heart of the South American rain forest, it had never been anywhere else and put him down in the middle of time square, it would look chaotic and crazy to him.

He would want to know why are people rushing down into the belly of the earth through these stairways. He would want to know why these strange metallic looking animals were whizzing by on the roads, and why people were hailing the yellow ones and letting them devour them right on the spot. There would be all kinds of problems that this man would have.

It would look chaotic and crazy because he wouldn't see the purpose to it. This world would seem full of senseless components. Now if you've lived in New York for a while, Times Square doesn't look quite that senseless though it's a little senseless still.

But I would propose to you that that image is a good illustration of how many people increasingly see their lives as time goes on. The older you get, the more you see that life doesn't seem to go by the rules. When you start out, when you're young, when you're in college, there's things that you're sure will never happen to you or things that you will never do.

There's rules, you see. None of your friends would ever do this. And as time goes by, you begin to wonder what rules there are.

Nice guys finish last the good day, die young, and all that. They happen. That happens.

And at a practical level, people, as they get older, begin to wonder about whether there's any rhyme or reason to it, intellectually, that's certainly true, increasingly, in the intellectual world. There are more thinkers are saying that the universe actually has randomness at its root, that the old scientific view of the universe, that it was a kind of the mechanistic view, the view that there's all these laws that have to be followed consistently, knows as people like Stephen Hawking and a whole lot of other people and a whole lot of other realms. They're saying there is no rhyme or reason to it.

Life is chaotic, history is chaotic. It's nothing but disorder. That's both a practical and an intellectual perception today.

Christianity, though, has, I would say, the most wonderful, the most sophisticated, and the most decisive answer to that perception. And the answer is really in the text that we've just read. Jesus is king.

In other words, if you went up to that poor guy from the South American rainforest, wandering around Times Square, having a fit, you'd stop him, you'd sit him down and he'd say calm down. I can explain. You probably couldn't explain it very quickly.

He has a long way to go to understand what a subway is, you see. What electricity is, maybe, but you could say calm down. There's an explanation.

Well, the Bible comes, and it says to us, when we see our lives and history looking chaotic, it says calm down. There's an explanation. And though it's not something that, again, just in the same way, the Bible says, I can't explain it all to you overnight, but the key to it all is the kingship of Christ.

And let me show you how this answers this perception, how this is the most sophisticated and wonderful and decisive answer to the apparent chaos of history.

如果有人从南美洲雨林的心脏地带被带出来，从未去过任何地方，然后被放在时代广场中央，那对他来说一切都显得混乱而疯狂。他会想知道为什么人们会冲进地底下的电梯里，又为什么会有一群奇怪的金属动物在道路上飞驰，为什么人们还会让这些黄色的家伙直接把他们吃掉。

这个人会有无数的问题。—— 以弗所书1章 它看起来会杂乱无章、疯狂无比，因为他看不到其中的意义。这个世界仿佛充满了毫无意义的碎片。如果你在纽约住过一段时间，时代广场虽然有些混乱，但也不完全是那样。

但我认为这个景象可以很好地说明许多人随着年龄增长而对生活越来越感到困惑的情况。年纪越大，就越觉得生活似乎并不遵循规则。当你年轻时，在大学里，你可能会认为某些事情永远不会发生在自己身上，或者自己永远不会做某事。有规则存在，你看，你的朋友们绝不会去做这些事。

但随着时间的推移，你会开始怀疑到底有什么规则。好人最后失败了，好日子总是短暂的，诸如此类的说法确实会发生。从实际角度来看，随着年龄的增长，人们开始质疑生活中是否真的有任何规律可循。在智识层面上，这一点也越来越明显。

越来越多的思想家认为宇宙本质上是随机的，而旧有的科学观点——即宇宙是一个机械论体系的观点，所有这些必须一致遵循的法则——已经被像斯蒂芬·霍金这样的许多人以及其他许多领域的人所质疑。他们说这世上并没有任何规律可循。生活是混乱的，历史也是混乱的，它只是一片无序。这是当今社会既实际又智识上的看法。

然而，基督教对此给出了最美好、最精妙且最具决定性的回答。而这个答案就藏在我们刚刚读过的经文中：耶稣是王。换句话说，如果你遇见了那个来自南美雨林的可怜人，在时代广场上乱跑，情绪失控，你停下来安慰他，坐下来说：“冷静下来，我可以解释。” 你可能无法很快解释清楚。

他还有很多需要理解的东西，比如地铁是什么，也许还有电，但你可以告诉他：“别担心，有解释的。” 圣经来了，对我们说，在我们看到生活和历史显得混乱时，要平静下来。这一切都有解释。虽然圣经不能一夜之间把一切都告诉你，但它告诉我们，关键在于基督的王权。

让我展示一下这个答案如何回应这种看法，它是对历史表面上的混乱最精妙、最美妙和最有决定性的回答。

## 基督王权的两个方面 / Two Aspects of Christ's Kingship

The Bible says, first of all, the kingship of Christ has two aspects, and these two aspects have to be in your mind understood and maintained as distinct but not separate. Distinct but not separate.

If you don't understand the two sides of this kingship, and if you don't understand that they're not identical, but they exist together, if you don't understand both of them and see them as distinct but not separate, your life and history will look like timesquare to that poor guy. And let me explain what the two are. They're right here in the text.

The first one is in the first part. It says, the mystery of his will, his good pleasure to bring all things in heaven on earth together under one head, even Christ.

---

圣经说，首先，基督的王权有两个方面，这两个方面必须在你的脑海中被理解为不同但不可分割。不同但不可分割。如果你不理解这王权的两个侧面，或者不明白它们不是完全相同的，却同时存在，如果你不能理解并看到它们是不同的但不可分割的，那么你的人生和历史将会显得像时代广场一样混乱。

让我解释一下这两个方面是什么。它们就在这段经文中。第一个方面在第一部分中提到：“神奥秘的旨意，就是照着他自己所喜悦的，使一切众人都服从基督，在天上地上都归一个头管辖。"

## 将来的国度：万物更新 / The Coming Kingdom: All Things Made New

Now this is talking about the coming kingdom.

Jesus Christ has a kingdom coming. His kingdom has a future aspect. I still think probably the best way to explain that is with this illustration.

God invented the universe, the way a clockmaker invents a clock, except that God put himself into the clock. God made the universe in the beginning kind of the way a clockmaker makes a clock, but God put himself into the clock. And we humanity, you might say, was the key cog.

If you could open up the back of the clock. If the universe was a clock and you could open up the back, the way it was originally designed, there was humanity right in the center, meshing with God above and meshing with nature beneath. We were the vice regents of the world, God's vice regents in nature, but when we decided to take the vice out of vice region, when we decided we wanted to be our own regents, we wanted to be our own kings, we wanted to be our own masters.

That was like a cog falling out, falling off of its axle down into all of the wheels below. What happened to the universe, the moment we decided to be our own directors, to be our own regents, what happened to the universe is exactly what would happen to a clock if that happened, and that is the universe began to smoke and grind and crack and splinter. And there were coils and springs and levers flying off in every direction, see.

In other words, the universe began to disintegrate. One thing that I think every scientist, every physicist, maybe even every psychologist I hope, certainly every biblical theologian will say is it is the nature of life and it's the nature of the universe in all of its aspects physically, socially, spiritually, culturally to deteriorate. Everything is decaying, everything's in the process of falling apart, everything is disintegrating, everything is unraveling, because that cog has fallen off of the axle down into the bottom of the clock and everything is groaning and everything is crunching and things aren't working right.

And so disease and decay comes in and injustice and oppression comes in and fear and guilt come in all because we aren't meshed with our king above. Now, God, we're told in the Bible and just look at history, God has allowed the tragedy work itself out. We're free moral agents.

He's let it happen. He's let us take the consequences, but he promised not to let us stew in our juices forever. He promised not to let us die forever.

He promised that someday he'd come back and that he would set up his kingdom anew and he would put humanity back on the axle and he'd mesh with us again from above. And when that happens, everything would be healed, physically and socially and spiritually in every way. Everything would come together again.

That's what Paul's talking about, right here, because you see, he says, this is the great plan. This is the mystery of his will, according to his pleasure. To be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment.

This is God's ultimate purpose. This is the point of history, right? To bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, Christ.

That means everything is disunited. Everything is disintegrating. It's going to be brought together.

It's going to become whole. Our bodies, instead of breaking apart as they get older, we're going to be made whole. Our souls, instead of breaking apart, will be made whole.

Our relationships, everything is united under one head. This idea of head, that means Christ is king. And head of the world, that's a moment in the future.

When everything is reached his fulfillment, everything will be united. Everything will be healed. He'll be the head.

And the universe, again, will be, in a sense, his body. And what is a body? It's an integrated whole of interlocking organic systems, you see, instead of just a bunch of wheels and pulleys that are all fighting against each other, which is the way the universe is now.

That is God's ultimate purpose. When the time is fulfilled, Jesus Christ will be king of all. All the resistance will be put down.

He will put us back on the axle, and he'll begin to mesh with us again from above. And when that happens, we don't really know what it's going to be like. But it's usually worth spending a few moments everyday meditating on what it's going to be like.

All we know is paradoxical, magnificent metaphors. We know that when he becomes head and king overall, death will die. Decay will finally decay.

This unity will disunite. Sickness will get terminally ill. Endings will be ended.

Violence will be violated. Disruption will be destroyed. Stuff like that.

I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into the heart. What he has in store for those who love him. I just love that place where Luke Skywalker says to Han Solo, he says, we need to go rescue the princess, you know why?

Because she's rich, really how rich, he says, more than you can imagine. Han Solo turns around and says, I can imagine an awful lot. We can imagine an awful lot.

So imagine what it must be that would be in store for us when on that day, when God says you can't imagine, I has not seen nor ear heard nor has it entered into your heart. You have no idea. You can imagine a lot of joy, can't you?

No, you can't. Nothing compared to it. On the day in which he is made head overall, that's what will happen.

Now, but that's only one aspect of his kingship. He is going to take up his kingship. He's going to have a future and complete kingship, but then there's a second aspect of his kingship that's mentioned here.

这说的是将要来临的王权。

耶稣基督有一个即将到来的王国。这个王国具有未来的一面。我认为最能解释这一点的方式是用这个比喻。上帝创造了宇宙，就像钟表匠发明了一只钟一样，不同的是，上帝把自己融入了这只钟中。

上帝在最初创造宇宙时，有点像钟表匠制造一只钟那样，但上帝把自己融入了这只钟里。而我们人类，可以说是我们这枚关键齿轮。如果你能够打开钟的背面。如果宇宙是一只钟，你能够打开它的背面，按照最初的设想设计，人就在中心，与上方的上帝相连接，与下方的自然界相连接。

我们是世界的副职管理者，是大自然中的副职管理者，但当我们决定去掉这个“副”字，当我们决定要成为自己的统治者，想要成为自己的国王和主人时，这一切就改变了。那就像一个齿轮掉了下来，从轴上掉到了下面所有的轮子中。当我们决定自己当导演、自己做主宰的那一刻，整个宇宙会发生什么？这和时钟发生同样的事情一样，宇宙开始冒烟、转动不灵、裂开、碎裂。

弹簧、发条和杠杆四散飞出，你看。换句话说，宇宙开始瓦解了。我认为每个科学家、每个物理学家，甚至每个心理学家，当然每个圣经神学家都会说，生命的本质以及宇宙在所有方面的物理、社会、精神、文化本质都是会退化的。一切都在腐烂，一切都在分崩离析，一切都在松散开来，因为那个齿轮已经从轴上掉到了钟的底部，一切都开始呻吟和嘎吱作响，事情都不对劲了。

于是疾病和腐败来了，不公和压迫来了，恐惧和罪疚也来了，这一切都是因为我们与上面的王失去了连接。上帝在圣经中告诉我们，并且历史也显示，上帝允许悲剧自行发展。我们是自由意志的主体，他让我们承担后果，但他承诺不会永远让我们自食其果。他保证不会让我们永远沉溺于自己的痛苦中，也不会让我们永远消亡。

他保证有一天他会回来，重新建立他的国度，把人类重新放在轴上，并且从上面与我们再次连接。那时，一切都会痊愈，无论是身体上的、社会上的还是精神上的，一切都将重新聚合。这就是保罗在这里所说的伟大计划，这是上帝意愿的奥秘，按照他的旨意，在适当的时候实现。这正是上帝最终的目的，历史的意义所在吧？

为了把天上和地上的所有事物都汇聚到基督之下。**这意味着一切都分裂了。**一切都在瓦解，最终都会被重新联合起来。它会变得完整。

我们的身体不再随着年龄老化而分解，而是会被治愈、恢复原状。我们的灵魂，不再破碎，也将得到治愈。我们的关系，所有的一切都将统一在一位领袖之下。这个“领袖”的概念意味着基督是王。

头的象征意味着基督将是世界的领袖，这是一个未来的时刻。当一切达到其最终实现时，一切都将被联合起来。一切都将被治愈。他将成为领袖。

而宇宙，再次来说，在某种意义上，将成为他的身体。什么是身体？它是由相互连接的有机系统组成的整体，而不是一堆互相争斗的齿轮和滑轮，这是现在的宇宙状态。这就是上帝的终极目的。

当时间成熟时，耶稣基督将成为万王之王。所有的抵抗都将被平息。他会把我们重新安置在轴上，并从上方开始与我们重新结合。那时会发生什么，我们并不知道，但通常值得每天花几分钟时间思考它会是什么样子。

我们知道的是悖论性的、壮丽的隐喻。我们知道当他在各方面成为领袖和王时，死亡将消亡。腐朽最终也将终结。这种统一将分裂。

疾病将变得致命。结局将结束。暴力将被侵犯。中断将被摧毁。

诸如此类的事情。我从未见过，也未曾听过，更未想到过。他为我们所准备的那些爱他的人。我喜欢那个地方，就像卢克·天行者对汉·索洛说的：“我们需要去救公主，你知道为什么吗？

” 因为她非常富有，他说：“有多富？多到你无法想象。” 汉·索洛转过身来说：“我能想象很多。” 所以想象一下，在那一天，当上帝说你们无法想象时，我从未见过，也未曾听过，更未想到过。

你根本不知道。你能想象出很多的喜悦，不是吗？不可以。没有什么能比得上它。

在他成为万有的头那一天，这一切就会发生。现在，这只是他王权的一个方面。他会接过他的王权，拥有完全的王权。但这里还提到了他王权的第二个方面。

## 基督此刻就是历史之王 / Christ Is King of History Now

We've already alluded to it, and that is he is king right now of history. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in the world. He may not have put down all resistance to himself yet in humanity.

But history has no resistance to him. He is a complete charge of every event of history. You see, the whole point of history is it says that when the times have reached their fulfillment to bring all things together in Christ and he says, in him we were chosen according to the plan of him who works out everything, everything, all things in conformity with the purpose of his will.

The old authorizer isn't used to say he works together all things according to the counsel of his will. Now you see, these two aspects of the kingship of Christ have to be brought together or you won't understand your life. Paul brings them together at the end of Ephesians 1 where he says, and I quote, and God placed all things under his feet and appointed him head over everything for the church, his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

Now what is this saying? It is saying that though you don't see Jesus Christ crowned yet overall, you don't see him having put down all resistance to his royal will. And therefore you see brokenness, you see physical imperfection, you see pain, you see suffering everywhere, but right now history is being steered by the king.

Jesus Christ you might say is in the driver's seat of history. He's steering it toward that omega point which is actually the alpha point, the place in which he fills all in all. And so everything that happens now, every single thing, every event, we'll get to that later here, every event is under his control and is part of what this passage calls in Greek, his plan, his purpose, his boulain, it's his plan, he's got a blueprint, and he's working out right now his lordship over history so that he can affect then his complete lordship and his complete healing of the universe.

Now unless you get these two things together, together, life will seem crazy. So for example, somebody says, well, wait a minute, if God, if Jesus Christ is king over everything and everything that's happening is happening according to his plan, that means he planned that earthquake, where the roofs fell in and all those poor people died in their sleep. If God is king, if Jesus is king, why is there suffering?

Now you see, that question forgets how sophisticated this answer is, Jesus' kingship does not have one aspect, it has two. He has got right now a plan to get us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. He's got a plan for history to get us to the place where there's no more killing, there's no more murder, there's no more death, there's no more anything.

And yet he's taking us there because many things have to happen before we get to that point. Well, what? Now, if we lived 2500 years ago, one thing we wouldn't have known anything about was the crucifixion.

We wouldn't have understood it. We wouldn't have known that Jesus Christ had a common die. If He hadn't died and He hadn't paid for the sins of those who believed in what would have happened is, of course, God could not deal with us in an appropriate way.

We didn't know that. Now we do. But there are many other things all on that road.

---

我们已经提到过这一点，那就是他现在是历史之王。他可能还没有在世界上消除所有反对自己的阻力，在人类中也没有消除所有反对自己的阻力。但是历史没有对他构成任何抵抗。他是历史上每一件事的完全主宰。

你看，历史的意义在于它表明当时候满足的时候，一切都会在基督里被聚集起来，他说，在他里面，我们已经被拣选，按照那预先定旨行事者的工作，即照着他意愿的计划，凡事都工作在一起。旧约中的作者说他是按着自己的意思使万事互相效力。现在你看，基督王权这两个方面必须结合起来，否则你无法理解你的生活。保罗在以弗所书1章末尾将它们结合在一起，他说：“神既在基督里与你们和好，也要叫世人因他得着和睦。

” 这段话的意思是说，尽管你还看不到耶稣基督被全面加冕，也没有看到他完全消除了所有反对自己王权的阻力。因此，你看到破碎、身体上的不完美、痛苦和苦难遍布各地，但目前历史正由这位国王引导。耶稣基督，你可以说他是历史的舵手。他正将历史引向那个奥米伽点，也就是阿尔法点——那是他充满一切、在一切之中的地方。

因此，现在发生的一切，每一个事件，我们稍后会谈到，每一个事件都在他的掌控之中，并且是这一段经文所说的希腊语“boulē”（旨意）的一部分，即他的计划和目的。他有一个蓝图，并正在此刻实现他对历史的主权，以便最终实现他对宇宙的完全主权和全面医治。除非你把这些两件事结合起来，生活才会显得合理。例如，有人可能会说：“等等，如果耶稣基督是万物之王，而所有发生的事情都是按照他的计划进行的，那么**这意味着他计划了那场地震，导致屋顶倒塌，那些可怜的人在睡梦中丧生。**

” 如果上帝是王，如果耶稣是王，为什么会有苦难？你看到，这个问题忽视了一个极其复杂且精妙的答案。耶稣的王权不是单一维度的，而是有两个方面。他现在有一个计划，将我们带向一个没有地震的地方。

他还有一个历史计划，将我们带向一个没有杀戮、没有谋杀、没有死亡、没有任何痛苦的世界。然而，在我们到达那个点之前，许多事情必须发生。如果我们生活在2500年前，我们不会知道十字架的意义。我们无法理解它。

我们不知道耶稣基督会受难并为相信他的人代赎罪。如果他没有死去并为那些相信他的人付清了罪债，当然，上帝不能以适当的方式对待我们。我们现在知道了这一点，但还有很多其他的事情在那条道路上等待着我们。

## 通向冠冕之路经过十字架 / The Road to the Crown Goes Through the Cross

In other words, God's taking us to a place where there is no pain. But the road to get to the place where there is no pain passes through pain. The road to the crown goes through the cross.

It had been for Jesus and it happens for us. At a certain level, we know this. Many of us, especially as we get older, realize that it's only the most shallow that a life without troubles creates shallowness.

A life without failures creates superficiality. I mean, intuitively, you realize there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about ourselves.

In many cases, there wasn't for our troubles. We wouldn't know much about. We wouldn't know God.

There's all sorts of hints. We don't understand it completely. But we're told.

There's two aspects to his kinship. He's steering us to the place where there's no more earthquakes. Yet he takes us through earthquakes on the road to get there.

He's steering us to the place where there's no more crosses, where there's nothing but crowns, but on the way, he himself had to go through a cross. I was reading a book recently by a British author named John Stott and John Stott said it this way. He said, one of the main reasons I'm a Christian is this.

He says, the world is so full of suffering and pain. The world is so full of evil and broken is that I could not believe in a God who had never suffered himself. I could not believe in a God who hadn't suffered and gone to the cross.

And he says, one of the reasons I'm a Christian is there's no other religion that offers you a God who's suffered. You see, God hates the earthquake. We're told that.

And yet it's woven into his plan. Why somebody says, listen, if he's really the king, why does he have to take his time? What are you telling me about?

Why does it have to take his time? I don't completely know. But I know, but that question probably sounds like this to God.

If your, most fathers have had this experience, you have a little kid three or four years old, and you say we're going to see grandmommy and granddaddy. Let's get in the car. I could say, yay, they get in the car, and you're on your way, and after five minutes, kids says, are we there yet, daddy?

And you say, no, we're not there. Why not? I'm tired.

I want to be there. You told me you were going to take me there. Why is it taking so long?

Now, you say, all right, honey, it's 350 miles to grandmommy and granddaddy's house. We have been going for five minutes. It's going to take a lot longer, and says, why don't you go faster, says the child?

You could go faster. I mean, you see, you know, you're all powerful, father. You could go faster.

So you tried to explain to a four-year-old child some of the laws of elementary physics. He doesn't want to hear it. He says, you're just being mean, and at a certain point, what do you say to a kid?

You say, honey, you're four years old, you don't understand physics, I'm sorry. But all I can tell you is fasten your seatbelt and be quiet. And you see, you know, there's an awful lot of very learned discourses, objecting to the very existence of God on the basis that if he really worked king, and if he was really taking us to the place where all the earthquakes would be gone, why aren't we there yet?

Very learned, very wonderful. You see, very, very detailed. And yet basically, it boils down to, are we there yet daddy?

Why not? Why couldn't you be going faster? And because I can't understand something, probably to God's mind, is as simple as elementary physics as to our mind.

Because I can't understand that. Therefore maybe there's no God at all. That's the normal response, but don't you see?

If Jesus Christ is king, it makes sense that not everything makes sense. If we relate to Him, even like my four-year-old son relates to me, it would make sense that not everything would make sense, if it made sense, it would make sense. You see, this is such a sensible mystery, this great doctrine, that he's in charge, we don't understand everything.

But he says, I'm taking you to that place where Jesus will fill all and all, and all things will be united. Meanwhile, everything that happens, all things are happening to get you to that place. Everything that happens, everything is designed to get us to the place where Jesus Christ is king of all.

Now what does that mean? Let's break it down practically. We just showed you why God controls history.

He's trying to get us to the place where Jesus is king of all. But how does he control history? If you take a look at this, the version that we have printed here says, he works everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, and I would like to meditate with you a minute on that, to show you how this doctrine is called, historically it's been called the doctrine of God's providence.

The doctrine of God's providence, where the word providence comes from, the word provide, which means that everything that happens is God's provision. And this doctrine is unique. It's different than humanism, it's different than secularism, it's different than Islam, it's different than other, it than Buddhism and Eastern religions, it's unique.

And it all is tied up in this word, everything. And I tell you, if you understand this word, everything, it'll change your life, it'll change your attitude, it'll change the way in which you handle life tomorrow. If you understand how he's exercising his kingship through providence, if you understand that everything works together according to the counsel of his will, the purpose of his will, it will change the way you live.

换句话说，上帝正带我们走向一个没有痛苦的地方。

但是通往那个没有痛苦之地的道路必须经过痛苦。通向冠冕的道路必经十字架。它对于耶稣来说是真实的，对于我们也是如此。在某种程度上，我们都知道这一点。

随着年龄的增长，许多人都意识到，没有苦难的人生只会带来肤浅。没有失败的人生只会显得表面化。你直觉地知道，如果没有这些困难，我们就不会真正了解自己。很多时候，如果没有这些困难，我们也无法真正了解。

我们甚至无法真正了解神。这其中有各种暗示，但我们并不完全理解。但有人告诉我们。他的亲缘关系有两方面。

他引导我们走向一个没有地震的地方。然而，在通往那里的路上，他会带我们经历地震。他引导我们走向一个没有十字架、只有王冠的地方。但在路上，他自己也必须经历十字架。

最近我读了一本英国作者约翰·斯托特的书，他说得正是这样。他说，成为基督徒的主要原因之一是这个。他说，这个世界充满了苦难和痛苦，充满了邪恶与破碎，以至于我不相信一个从未受过苦的神。我不相信一个没有经历过苦难、没有上过十字架的神。

他还说，成为基督徒的另一个原因是没有任何其他宗教能提供一位受过苦的神。你看，神憎恶地震。我们被告知了这一点。然而，它却编织在他的计划中。

为什么有人说，如果他是**真正的国王，他为什么要花这么长时间？你是**在告诉我什么？为什么一定要花这么久的时间？我不完全知道。

但我知道，这个问题可能听起来像这样对神来说。如果你的大多数父亲都有过这样的经历，你会有一个三岁或四岁的孩子，你说我们要去看爷爷奶奶。我们上车吧。我可以说，好啊，他们上了车，你出发了，五分钟后，孩子们会说，爸爸，我们现在到那儿了吗？

我说，还没呢。为什么？我很累。我想去那里。

你告诉我你会带我去的。为什么要花这么长时间？现在，你说，好吧，亲爱的，去奶奶和爷爷家有350英里。我们已经走了五分钟了，还要走很久呢。

于是孩子说，你为什么不快点开？你可以开得更快。我是说，你知道，你是全能的，爸爸。你可以开得更快。

然后你试着向一个四岁的小孩解释一些基本物理定律。但他不想听。他说你只是在耍脾气。到了某个时刻，你会怎么跟小孩说呢？

你说，亲爱的，你还只有四岁，不懂物理学，对不起。但我能告诉你的就是系好安全带，安静点。你看，你知道的，有很多非常有学问的人反对上帝的存在，理由是如果他真的在运作，如果我们真的要被带到一个没有地震的地方，为什么我们还没有到那里？这些论证很学究气，很好听。

你看，非常详细。但归根结底，就是问一句：爸爸，我们什么时候到？为什么不快点开呢？因为我不能理解某件事，并不意味着上帝也不能理解。

或许在上帝的眼中，这就像对我们来说基本物理定律一样简单。因为我不理解这一点。所以也许根本就没有上帝。这是正常的反应，但你难道没有发现吗？

如果耶稣基督是王，那么有些事情不讲得通是有道理的。如果我们以我和四岁儿子的关系来理解他，那么一些事情不讲得通也是有道理的。如果一切都能讲得通，那反而显得不合理了。你看，这个伟大的奥秘如此合乎逻辑，那就是他在掌管一切，我们无法完全理解。

但他告诉我们，他会带我们到一个地方，在那里耶稣会充满一切，并且所有事物都会被统一起来。在此期间，每一件事的发生都是为了让你们到达那个地方。每一件事的发生，都是为了让我们到达一个地方——在那里，耶稣基督是万王之王。那么这到底意味着什么呢？

让我们从实际的角度来分解一下。我们刚刚解释了上帝如何控制历史。他正试图带我们到一个地方，让耶稣成为万王之王。但他如何掌控历史呢？

如果你仔细看看这段话，这里印刷的版本说，他使万事互相效力，达到他的旨意。我想和你们一起思考一下这个观点，向你们展示这个教义是如何被称作“神的预定论”的。神的预定论，这个词源自“提供”，意味着一切发生的事都是神的安排。这一教义是独特的，不同于人文主义、世俗主义、伊斯兰教以及其他宗教，包括佛教和其他东方宗教，它是独一无二的。

这一切都与一个词紧密相连——“万事”。我告诉你们，如果你们理解了这个“万事”这个词，它会改变你们的生活，改变你们的态度，也会改变你们明天处理生活的态度。如果你明白神通过预定论行使他的王权，明白一切按照他旨意中的计划和目的互相效力，这将彻底改变你们的生活方式。让我来解释一下。

## 神的计划包括小事 / God's Plan Includes Little Things

Let me show you. First of all, what's the word, everything mean? It means three things, A, it means, everything means God's plan includes little things.

God's plan includes little things, it has to. Most of us don't think of it this way, everything. It says in Proverbs 16, the lot is cast into the lap, but the disposal is the Lord's.

That means even when you flip a coin, if it comes down heads or it comes down tails, it was part of his plan. Nothing is left out of his plan. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month, to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Okay, that's the first thing I want to stress, let me push it a little bit. People say, come on, nothing.

You're telling me that the tie that Tim Keller was wearing today was part of God's plan from all eternity. You're trying to tell me the shoes that I decided to wear today was part of God's plan. Little things like that, well, they're only little things to you and me because we're so unwise.

There are no little things. Now, Teddy Roosevelt in 1912, somebody tried to shoot Teddy Roosevelt and they did shot him in the chest. You know why he lived?

Because he happened to have his glasses case on this side instead of this side. Your marriages, in many cases, your careers, what school you go to, very often are based on so-called little things. I can give you a quick example.

I didn't do it this morning but my wife told me I must tell her the four o'clock service even if you've heard the story before because of perfect example. And the only, the reason that I'm a Presbyterian minister was because of a particular faculty member that came to my seminary my last semester and pushed me over the edge. When it came to my theological understanding and I decided, yeah, I think I need to be a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm here today. Why did he come? The only reason he came that year was because somebody he was trying, he was British and he was having a lot of trouble getting a passport to come and teach at my seminarian Massachusetts, but somebody pulled strings for him.

Yeah, from real high up. He remembers one day, every day he'd go to the American Embassy and he'd stand this long line and he says, I'm never going to get a passport, I'm never going to, but you know, one of the problems back then was he had to prove that an American citizen couldn't do the job as well as he could to get this job and it was a very long process and one day somebody came out looking for him, calling his name out, somebody came out when he was standing in this long line and called him in and says, you're going to be an American within a week. We got word from real high up.

Well, you know who that was. It was a guy named Mike Ford. Mike Ford was the president of the, was the son of the president at the time.

Mike Ford was the son of Gerald Ford and he was a student at Gordon Conwell Seminary where I was and he found a way to get this particular faculty member to Gordon Conwell because his father was a president. You know why his father was president? Because of Watergate.

You know, because of the Watergate scandal, Nixon had resigned and Gerald Ford was the president. The reason that Mike Ford had the clout to get this guy over there, that's the reason why he was there. That's the reason I became a Presbyterian.

That's the reason I'm talking to you right now. Well why did Nixon fall? Because some stupid Watergate burglar left the door open one night and some guard noticed that the door was open.

Now, what if that guard hadn't gone by that day? Maybe he went by that day because that morning he didn't eat breakfast and he got in a little bit early. You see, I wouldn't be here if that guard hadn't seen.

That door open. That's the way everything in your life is. Ray Bradbury had it figured out.

Ray Bradbury has one great story about the future, about a time travel. And he has this one story about how when people would go back into time, they had to be very careful to walk on a magnetic field and not touch anything. Otherwise everything would change and one of the stories, one of the time travelers accidentally slips and falls off the magnetic field and steps on a butterfly.

That kills it and everything changes, the rest of the universe, the rest of history changes forever. Everything's interlocked. It's silly not, you know, when people say, you mean, God has planned everything out.

If you think you'll realize there is no other way, can you imagine the terror that a thoughtful person would get up out of the bed every day with knowing that there was such a thing as a chance? Anything could happen. Knowing that the tiniest little thing could completely change everything about your life, completely change civilization.

God's plan includes everything therein lies your security.

"万事"的意思是什么？它意味着三件事：A、它意味着神的计划包括小事。神的计划包括小事，这是必须的。我们大多数人都不会这样思考“万事”。

圣经箴言16章提到：“投掷骰子是出于偶然，但一切都是耶和华安排好的。” **这意味着即使你抛硬币，结果是正面还是反面，都是他计划的一部分。**没有任何事情会脱离他的计划。你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是一个放荡的弟弟的故事。

事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是想对那些逃避上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得他爱的人说些什么。在《浪子的神》一书中，提摩太·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事如何揭示福音的核心信息——一个为悖逆的年轻兄弟和苛责的老兄带来希望的信息，并且向所有人发出邀请，让他们体验上帝慷慨而无尽的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，读《浪子的神》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是本月我们对贵赠的感谢，它将帮助福音和生命分享基督仁慈而不懈之爱的信息给全世界的人们。

今天就访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取你的副本吧。现在，让我们来听提摩太·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。首先，我要强调的第一件事是，请允许我再深入一点。有人会说：“好了，够了。

” 你告诉我，提摩太·凯勒今天穿的领带是否从永恒就属于上帝的计划？你要告诉我，我今天穿的鞋子也是上帝的计划的一部分吗？这些小事对你和我来说可能只是微不足道的事，因为我们太过无知。实际上，并没有所谓的小事。

1912年，西奥多·罗斯福在竞选总统时被人开枪射击，子弹射中了他的胸部。你知道他为什么能活下来吗？因为他恰好把眼镜盒放在了左边而不是右边。你的婚姻、工作乃至你选择的学校，在许多情况下都取决于看似微不足道的小事。

我可以给你一个快速的例子。我今天早上没有讲，但我的妻子告诉我，即使你之前听过这个故事，也必须告诉她四点钟的礼拜。这正是因为我最后一年在神学院时，有一位特定的教师鼓励了我，促使我在神学理解上做出了决定——是的，我认为自己应该成为长老会牧师。这就是我今天站在这里的原因。

他为什么来？那一年，他来这里只有一个原因——因为他当时是英国人，在办理签证去马萨诸塞州神学院任教时遇到了很多麻烦，但有人为他打通了关系。没错，是从很高的层面。他记得有一天，每天他都排着长长的队伍去美国大使馆，他说自己永远也拿不到护照了，但他知道，那时候的一个大问题是：他必须证明一个美国人无法像他那样胜任这份工作，这个过程非常漫长。

有一天，有人在长队中喊他的名字，把他叫到一边说：“你一周之内就会成为美国人。”他们得到了来自高层的通知。你知道是谁吗？是迈克·福特。

迈克·福特当时是戈登康韦尔神学院的学生，他是当时的总统的儿子。迈克·福特的父亲是杰拉尔德·福特，而他之所以能为这位教师打通关系，是因为他的父亲是总统。你知不知道为什么他的父亲会成为总统？因为水门事件。

正是因为水门事件，尼克松辞职了，杰拉尔德·福特成了总统。迈克·福特能够为那位教师争取到这个机会，就是因为他的父亲是总统。这就是他在这里的原因。这也是我成为长老会牧师的原因。

这也是我现在站在这里的原因。那么，尼克松为什么会倒台呢？因为某个愚蠢的水门事件窃贼在某天晚上把门忘了关，一个巡逻的警卫注意到了门是开着的。现在，如果那天那个警卫没路过怎么办？

也许那天他起晚了，没有吃早餐就提前来了。你看，如果不是那个警卫注意到门是开着的，我就不会在这里和你们说话了。这就是你生活中一切事情的方式。雷·布拉德伯里早就看透了这一点。

Ray Bradbury 有一篇关于未来的精彩故事，讲述了一次时间旅行。在故事中，当人们回到过去时，必须非常小心地走在磁力线上，不能触碰任何东西。否则一切都将改变。有一次，一名时间旅行者不小心从磁力线上滑落，踩到了一只蝴蝶。

这一脚改变了所有事情，整个宇宙、整个人类历史都因此永远改变了。一切息息相关。当人们说“上帝已经计划好了所有的事情”时，这听起来似乎很荒谬。如果你认为一切都是命中注定的，你能想象一个深思熟虑的人每天早上起床时会有多么恐惧吗？

他知道生活中存在着偶然性，任何事情都有可能发生。知道最微小的事情都可能彻底改变你的生活，甚至彻底改变文明。上帝的计划包括一切，这正是你的安全所在。

## 神的计划包括我们的选择 / God's Plan Includes Our Choices

Okay, secondly, the word everything means God's plan also includes our choices. How does this something that people have trouble with, right?

The first point I just made was that God's plan includes little things. Every little thing, everything is part of his plan. It says everything works out according to his plan.

Well, your first reaction is, that's terrible. That means that we're all faded to do things and we have no freedom and there's no freedom. That's not true.

As a matter of fact, it's not true because of this word everything. My second point here is that God's plan includes our choices. Fatalism.

Listen, the Greeks taught fatalism, the Romans taught fatalism, the Muslims teach fatalism of a sort, a kismet. But fatalism does not include our choices in a fatalistic system of thought. Everything is fixed except our choices.

Let me give you an example. In all the Greek myths, if a prophecy comes and says this woman or this man is destined is faded to be a criminal. If that poor person spends years trying to be good, trying to live a good life, trying to avoid a life of crime, it won't matter why.

Because you see in the Greek worldview, in the fatalistic worldview, if you're faded to be a criminal, it doesn't matter what you do. You are faded in spite of your choices. No matter how hard you try to be good, you are faded, you are destined to be a criminal.

And that's the way fatalism works. In other words, everything is fixed except your choices. You can do anything with your choices, but it doesn't matter.

But Christianity is different, Christianity says everything is part of God's plan, including your choices. The plan is fixed through your choices, including your choices, not in spite of which means something very simple and yet very profound, very mysterious and yet very sensible. It simply means that your choices are always part of the plan.

Here's Jacob. Jacob sins against his father and he robs his brother. As a result, he has to leave and live in a foreign land and he has a very miserable life.

And yet, he meets the love of his life in that foreign land, Rachel. They have their children through whom the Messiah Jesus Christ has ascended. So it's very clear that Jacob had to sin and had to go to that foreign land for Jesus to be born.

And Jesus obviously was planned by God, right? Yes. So the sin was planned, right?

Yes, of course. And yet the sin was free. The sin was responsible.

Nobody coerced him and yet it was part of the plan. And the bad consequences that came into his life happened because of the plan. And because of the choice, it all works together.

Jacob was completely free and completely responsible and yet every single thing that happened to him was part of the plan. All at once. God is in control.

We are free. Why? Because everything is part of the plan.

God never fixes our fate despite our choices. You know, Charles Spurgeon had that great story, used to tell. He went by, Charles Spurgeon believed all this.

He was a Baptist preacher. He went to see a friend of his who was sick and he says, how are you doing? And the friend says, oh, I don't know if I should take my medicine.

And Spurgeon says, why? And he says, well, he says, I don't know whether God has destined me to live or die. And Spurgeon says, you know, now Spurgeon could have lectured and said, okay, in the Greek idea of fate, if you're going to die, it doesn't matter what you do.

Not in the Christian view. Oh, no, your choices are always linked to the plan. And so what did he say?

He says, my dear friend, I can tell you exactly what's going to happen. If you take your medicine, you're destined to live. If you don't take your medicine, you're destined to die.

Because everything, everything, is part of his plan. This makes perfect sense even though you can't quite always, you know, kind of work the thing out. There's a great place in the book of Acts, Acts chapter 27, in which Paul's on a ship.

And the ship is in a terrible storm. And Paul gets up and says, God has shown me that no one on this ship will lose their lives, but we will lose the ship. We're going to be shipwreck, but no one will lose their life.

God has spoken. Okay, it's a prophecy. All right.

And yet, at one point, the soldiers try to get into the lifeboats. And Paul runs over and says, if you get in the lifeboats, we'll all die. Don't get in the lifeboats.

This is like three verses after he just said, God has said, no one will perish. So what did they do? They said, okay, Paul says, don't do it, or we'll be killed.

And yet, of course, nobody perished. Why? Because you see, God never fixes our fate despite our choices, but through our choices.

Because unlike fatalism, everything is part of his plan. And that means friends, when you make a choice, when you've got a choice before you, make it well. Don't shrug and say it doesn't matter.

Because if you make a good choice, you'll be in good shape. If you make a bad choice, all kinds of terrible consequences will happen. And yet, knowing that, on the other hand, the wonderful thing about this great doctrine is, and yet, you have to realize you can't screw your life up, past what God has in store for you.

And he says, his will for you is he loves you. You can't do something, and then, and frustrate God, you see? God's never looking down at you and saying, oh my gosh, what did she do that for?

Now what am I going to do? I guess I guess I could have her marry this guy instead, but I don't know. You know, that's not way God operates.

You make a bad choice, you've made a bad choice. You make a bad choice. You do something stupid, you do something rash, you do something wicked.

There will be consequences, and yet, and yet, everything is part of this plan. You can't muck up your life. He's working in it, but lastly, his plan includes everything, therefore, little things.

His plan includes everything, therefore, choices. But God's plan includes everything. His control, his kingship over history, includes everything, including bad things.

其次，"一切"这个词还意味着上帝的计划也包括我们的选择。

这一点很多人难以接受，对吧？我刚才提到的第一点是：上帝的计划包括小事。每一件小事，每一个细节都包含在他的计划中。圣经上说：“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。

” 你的第一反应可能是：这太糟糕了。**这意味着我们什么都做不了，没有自由，也没有选择权。**其实并非如此。事实上，并非如此，因为“一切”这个词说明了这一点。

我的第二个观点是：上帝的计划包括我们的选择。宿命论并不包含在宿命论的思想体系中，除了我们的选择之外一切都固定不变。让我举个例子。在所有的希腊神话中，如果一个预言说某个人注定要成为罪犯。

即使那个可怜的人花费多年时间努力做好事、过好生活、避免犯罪生涯，这又有什么用呢？因为你看，在希腊世界观中，在宿命论的世界观里，如果你注定要成为罪犯，那么无论你做什么都无济于事。你是被注定的，与你的选择无关。不管你多么努力地想做好人，你也注定会成为罪犯。

换句话说，一切都被固定了，除了你的选择。你可以通过你的选择做任何事情，但这并不重要。但基督教不同。基督教说一切都是上帝计划的一部分，包括你的选择。

计划是通过你的选择来实现的，而不是与你的选择相对立，**这意味着非常简单而又深刻、神秘而又合乎逻辑。**它仅仅意味着你的选择总是包含在计划中。这里有个例子：雅各。他背叛了他的父亲，并抢夺了哥哥。

因此，他不得不离开家乡，在异国他乡过着悲惨的生活。然而，在那个陌生的地方，他遇到了他的挚爱拉结。他们通过他们的孩子带来了耶稣基督的诞生。很明显，雅各必须犯下罪行并流亡到异国他乡，才能让耶稣出生。

显然，耶稣是上帝计划的一部分，对吧？是的。那么，罪行也是计划的一部分吗？当然，没错。

但是这个罪行又是自由的、有责任的。没有人强迫他去做，但它是计划的一部分。而那些不良后果也都是因为他的选择而发生的。雅各完全自由，完全负责任，但他所经历的一切都包含在计划中。

上帝掌控一切。我们是自由的，为什么？因为一切都是计划的一部分。上帝从不固定我们的命运，尽管我们有选择。

你知道查尔斯·斯浦根讲过一个很好的故事。他相信这一切。他是一个浸信会牧师。有一次去看望一位生病的朋友，他说：“你怎么样？

”朋友回答说：“我不知道我是否应该吃药。” 斯潘塞说，为什么呢？他说，我不知道上帝是否已经决定了我的生死。斯潘塞说，你知道，在希腊的宿命论观念里，如果注定要死，那么无论做什么都无济于事。

但在基督徒的观点中并非如此。哦，不，你的选择总是与他的计划相连。那么他怎么说的呢？他说：“我亲爱的朋友，我可以告诉你确切会发生什么。

如果你服药，你就会活下来；如果不服药，你就注定会死去。” 因为每一件事都是他计划的一部分。这虽然听起来合乎逻辑，但有时你可能无法完全理解其中的原因。在使徒行传27章中有一个很好的例子，在那里保罗正在一艘船上。

船遭遇了可怕的风暴。保罗站起来说：“上帝已经向我显明，这艘船上的人没有人会丧命，但我们将会船毁人亡。” 上帝已经说话了。好吧，这是一个预言。

然而，后来士兵们试图进入救生艇。保罗跑过去说：“如果你们上救生艇，我们都会死。”不要上救生艇。就在他说“没有人会丧命”之后的几节经文中，士兵们还是尝试这样做。

他们对保罗说：“保罗这么说，我们就不上。” 然而，当然，没有人丧命。为什么呢？因为你看，上帝并没有通过我们的选择来决定我们的命运，而是通过我们的选择。

与宿命论不同的是，每一件事都是他计划的一部分。**这意味着朋友们，在你面前有选择时，要慎重做出决定。**不要轻描淡写地说它无关紧要。如果你做出了好的选择，你会处于良好的状态；如果你做了坏的选择，将会发生各种可怕的后果。

然而，这个伟大教义的美妙之处在于，你知道无论怎样努力，你的生活都不会超出上帝为你预定的道路之外。他这样说：他的心意就是爱你。你不能做一件事，然后去惹恼神，你看？神从不会俯视你说：“天啊，她这是干什么？

”“那我该怎么办呢？” 现在我要问的是什么呢？我大概可以让她嫁给那个男人吧，但我不知道。你知道的，这并不是神做事的方式。

你做出了一个糟糕的选择，你就已经做出了糟糕的选择了。你做出一个愚蠢的行为，一个鲁莽的行为，或者一个邪恶的行为。会有后果，然而，这一切都是计划的一部分。你无法搞砸你的生活。

他在运作这一切，但最后，他的计划包括一切，因此，小事情也不例外。他的计划包括一切，因此是选择。但是神的计划包括一切。他对历史的掌控，包括了一切，甚至包括了糟糕的事情。

## 神的计划包括坏事 / God's Plan Includes Bad Things

And I know this is the toughest one, but let me tell you a story to explain. God hates the bad things, and yet, he includes the bad things. He weaves them into his plan.

Why, somebody says? Well, we already, I went through it once and told you that it partly, it's a mystery. Partly, this is a place where you have to say, I'm a child, you're a father, okay?

I don't understand why we can't be a grandma so quickly, but on the other hand, I understand that you're the father, all right, I'll tighten my seatbelt, and I'll be quiet. And yet, fortunately, the Bible gives us more than that, doesn't treat us as babies. It gives us some wonderful stories.

Let me give you an example. All things work together according to the Council of his will, or Romans 8.28, all things work together for good to those who love God. One essential story of this is the story of Jacob and Joseph.

Jacob was a patriarch. Jacob was a man who had 12 sons, and he did the stupidest thing that a father can do. He set his heart on one of his 12 sons, Joseph.

He doted on that little boy. He doted on that young man, and he was clearly in love with the kid, and he was clearly the favorite, and there's nothing that can inject pain into a family worse than that. And it did.

As Joseph grew up, because he was indulged, and because he was centered on, he was becoming an arrogant kid, he was becoming a superficial and empty person, he was becoming the kind of superficial and empty person that always comes out of such an indulgent environment. Meanwhile, the other brothers were turning into alienated and resentful kids, and alienated resentful young men, and finally their resentment grew to the place where they became capable of a horrible thing. The kidnap Joseph, they put him into a pit, and they sold him into slavery, and they told his father he was dead, that an animal had killed him.

And his father, because Joseph was his god, Joseph was his idol, his father lost all hope, and went into depression for years. The sons who had done this, the brothers who had done this, lived with a guilt, and over the years it became unbearable, and they became alienated from each other, and their father and their life was miserable. But Joseph did not die, he was sold into slavery, and in the hardship of slavery, and in the hard knocks of Egypt he got what his father never could have given him, Jacob never could have given it to him, character, grit, savvy, wit, and he learned to cling to God.

And eventually this brought out the potential in Joseph, he never would have happened if he stayed at home, it brought out the potential, and eventually he came to the place where he rose up to become prime minister of Egypt. And with his foresight he realized that a famine was coming and he created a grain reserve program, so that when the famine hit, instead of everybody starving to death, he was in charge of giving out the grain from the years of plenty, so that the people during the years of famine weren't starving. While the famine stretched all the way up to the place where Jacob and the 11 remaining brothers lived, and Jacob sent ten of the brothers down to Egypt to get grain and to get food so they wouldn't starve.

And when they see Joseph, Joseph recognizes them, but Joseph is hidden to them, they don't recognize him. Joseph can't believe it when he sees his brothers. He wants to have revenge, but he wants to test them.

So he says, who are you? They explain. We're from a far country where twelve brothers, one of them is dead, one is at home with our father, who's elderly.

Your spy, as he says. You're here to spy us out and give information to invading countries. No, no, no, not a bit.

Not at all, they say. That's not true. We're really brothers.

Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do, says the prime minister. I'm going to keep one of your brothers, I'm going to keep Simeon, I'm going to put him in jail here. I'm going to send you home with just a little food, but if you want more food, if you want to not starve, you've got to prove that you are really a family, bring that youngest son Benjamin back, that you tell me about, bring him here, then I'll know you're telling the truth, but if you don't come back with Benjamin, you'll never see my face again.

You'll never get grain here, you'll all starve. So sadly, they go back to Jacob and they say, father, we've got a little bit of food, but if we're going to go back again, we've got to take Benjamin. And at that point, Jacob, you see, cries out.

And in Genesis chapter 42, verse 36, he cries a cry that I believe is the quintessential cry of a person looking at life without seeing it through the kingship of Christ. He says, I say, we've got to take Benjamin back, we've got to go back. And he says, no, Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more.

And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more. And now you would take Benjamin from me, everything is against me.

And at the moment, he said that God was moving heaven and earth for Jacob. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, Joseph and the whole family would have been destroyed. If Jacob hadn't lost Joseph, the whole region would be dying of starvation.

Through the incident of the loss of Joseph, God was healing Joseph. He was humbling his brothers. He was helping the whole region economically.

And he was destroying the idols that were ruining and distorting Jacob's life. God was moving everything, moving heaven and earth for Jacob. But is that what Jacob thought?

No, what did he say? Everything is against me. Joseph is no more.

But Joseph was just being hidden from him, he was in preparation. Simeon is no more. Simeon was really fine, he was in preparation.

Everything is against me. That's how your life will always look, if you refuse to believe that God knows more than you. If you refuse to believe he's king, if you refuse to believe he's good, then how about you?

How do you feel when you look at your life right now? Do you feel that way? What's the cry of your heart?

You say, I'm never going to find love now. I'm never going to find success now. These things are no more.

And everything is against me. Is that how you feel? What's understandable?

I mean, look at Jacob, that's how he felt, that's how he saw things. He was a patriarch, he was no idiot. He wasn't stupid and neither are you to feel that way.

But you're wrong. You're wrong. Be careful.

Look in the mirror of that cry. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more. You're going to take Benjamin from me, everything is against me.

Look in that cry, there's a mirror there. And so I don't want to be like that. I don't want to say that.

Friends, if you understand that God's plan includes bad things, that God's plan includes your choices, that God's plan includes little things, and that all of God's plan is controlling every single event to the end and to the goal of making Jesus Christ all in all and king of all healing the universe, then you understand the doctrine of providence. And if you understand it and you begin to operate on this, on that wavelength, you begin to remind yourself of these things all the time. What will that do to you?

Well, I'll just close by saying it'll have three effects. One is it'll make you feisty, feisty. You see, if you believe that God hates the evil as much as you do, and that though it's in store, you're going to get hurt, you're going to be hurt, you're going to find all sorts of bad things happening to you and around you.

But you know that you can lose a battle, but you can't lose a war. See, the pagan notion of evil is that's it, except it. And the modern notion of evil is it's random, let's fight against it.

But Christians understand that we fight with hope. There's a feistiness, you know, the latest, the last twilight Paris album has it's, I think it's the first song on the first side, a song God is in control, oh, it's not the greatest work of art, but the feistiness is in the lyrics. And the chorus goes, God is in control.

We believe that his children will not be forsaken. God is in control. We choose to believe, we choose to remember and never be shaken.

We choose to remember and never be shaken. There is no power above or beside him. We know God is in control.

There's a feistiness, you know, in your face evil. We choose to remember and never be shaken. It's your choice.

There's a feistiness, secondly, there's also a kind of contentment because even when things go bad, you know what God's doing to you. There's this great little book for children called the Velveteen Rabbit and in one place in the Velveteen Rabbit, these two animals, stuffed animals, two toys in the nursery are talking to each other. And the one toy says to the other toy, what does it mean to get real?

Well, it says the skin horse. It's a thing that happens to you when a child loves you for a long, long, long time. Not just to play with, but really loves you, you become real.

It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you're real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes have dropped out and you get all loose in the joints and you're very shabby, but these things don't matter at all because once you're real, you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand.

You see, if you understand the doctrine of Christ's kingship, you know that everything that's happening to you is God's way of making you real, even if your hair is loved off or your eyes are fallen out of you, feeling kind of shabby and you know the stuffing is coming out the back. But you see, there's a contentment because you know that this is part of his plan that includes everything. But lastly, and this is something of a warning, the doctrine of God's providence humbles us.

Because you know the promise is all things work together for good to those who love God. Now, do you know what that means? All things work together for good to those who love God.

What does that mean? It means this. Very important.

Last thing I'm going to say, very critical, hope you wake up now, okay? If everything that happens happens to the goal to make Christ king, right? Everything that's happening is happening to that end.

That means that if you have made Christ king of your life, if you've made him save your and king, if that's the thing you're living for, if that's the preeminent desire of your life, then everything that happens in the world, every grain of sand, every atom, every molecule, every event is for you. All things work together for good to those who love God. But if on the other hand, you're living as your own king, if you rejected the kingship of Christ, you might be religious, but you're your own master, you decide and you call the shots.

If you're working against his kingship, that means that every event in the universe is against you and there's no in between. Either every molecule in the universe is for you or every molecule in the universe is against you. You can see it.

Do you make Jesus king? Then what? No matter good or bad things that happen to you, it's moving him more toward him, toward it.

You know, when good things happen, you're closer to God because you're so grateful. When bad things happen, you're closer to God. Why?

Because it shows you how much you need him. But now let's take a look at a person who's rejected the kingship of Christ. Good and bad things, the good things just make this person feel that I don't need God.

And the bad things make the person feel I can't trust him. So whether a good or bad happens to a person who is not submitted to the kingship of Christ, everything that happens, everything good or bad or indifferent is hardening you, pushing you away, moving you away. You can have a universe in which every atom is for you and every atom is against you, but there's nothing in the middle.

我知道这可能是最难理解的一点，但我来给你讲一个故事来解释。神憎恶那些糟糕的事情，然而他却把它们编织进了他的计划中。为什么呢？我们已经说过，这是一个部分谜团。

部分来说，你必须承认自己是孩子，而他是父亲，好吧？我不能立刻成为祖母，但另一方面，我知道你是父亲，好的，我会系好安全带，保持安静。幸运的是，圣经给了我们更多，它不只是把我们当作婴儿看待。它给我们讲述了一些精彩的故事。

让我举个例子。所有事情都按照他心意的旨意相互效力，或罗马书8章28节所说：“万事互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”一个关键的故事就是雅各和约瑟的故事。雅各是一个先祖，他有12个儿子，并且做了父亲最愚蠢的事情之一。

他对12个儿子中的一个特别偏爱，那就是约瑟。他对那个小男孩宠爱有加，对那个年轻人更是如此，显然他是深深爱着这个孩子，显然是他的宠儿。没有任何事情比这更能伤害一个家庭了。而确实发生了。

约瑟长大后，因为受到溺爱，又备受关注，渐渐变得骄傲自大，成为一个虚浮空洞的人。与此同时，其他兄弟们则变成了疏远和怨恨的孩子，最终他们的怨恨加深到了可以做出可怕事情的地步。他们绑架了约瑟，把他扔进一个枯井里，然后将他卖为奴隶，并告诉父亲说被野兽杀死了。约瑟的父亲因为约瑟是他心中的神，约瑟是他的偶像，所以当约瑟失踪后，父亲失去了所有的希望，陷入抑郁多年。

那些做出这一切的兄弟们，背负着巨大的罪恶感，随着时间的推移，这种感觉变得无法忍受，他们彼此疏远，父亲和他们的生活都变得悲惨起来。但约瑟并没有死，他被卖为奴隶，在奴隶生活的艰辛中，在埃及的艰难困苦中，他获得了他父亲从未能给予他的东西——品格、毅力、机智和幽默感，并学会了依靠上帝。最终，这一切激发了约瑟的潜能，如果他留在家中，这一切都不会发生。这些经历让他成长起来，最终他成为埃及的宰相。

凭借远见卓识，他意识到饥荒即将来临，于是建立了一个粮食储备计划，在饥荒来临时，他负责发放这些年丰收时储存的粮食，确保人们不会饿死。当饥荒波及到雅各和剩下的11个兄弟所在的地区时，雅各派了十个兄弟去埃及买粮。当他们见到约瑟时，约瑟认出了他们，但他的兄弟们却不知道他是谁。看到自己的兄弟时，约瑟无法相信。

他想报复他们，但他也想考验他们。所以他说：“你们是谁？”他们解释道：“我们来自一个遥远的国度，那里有十二个兄弟，其中一个死了，另一个留在家里和我们的父亲在一起，他年纪大了。” 他是说你们是间谍。

你们来这里是为了侦察我们，并向入侵国家提供情报。不，不，不，不是这样的。他们说：“一点也不对。我们真的是兄弟。

” 好吧，我告诉你们该怎么办，首相说道。“我要留一个你们的兄弟在这里，就是西缅，把他关在监狱里。我会给你们一些粮食，但如果你想得到更多的粮食，不想饿死的话，你们必须证明自己是**真正的家人，把最小的弟弟本雅悯带回来给我看，这样我就知道你们说的是**真话了。但如果你们不带本雅mins回来，你们就永远见不到我的面了。

” 你们将无法再得到粮食，你们都会饿死。所以他们悲伤地回到了雅各那里，并说：“我们还有一些粮食，但如果我们再去一趟，我们必须带上本雅mins。” 在这个时候，你看到雅各哭了。在《创世记》第42章第36节中，他发出了我认为是那种没有透过基督王权看待生命的人的终极哭声。

他说：“我们必须带本雅mins回去，我们必须回去。” 他又说：“不，约瑟已经不在了，西缅也已经不在了。” 现在你们要从我这里带走本雅mins，一切都对我不利。约瑟已经不在了，西缅也已经不在了。

现在你们又要从我这里带走本雅mins，一切都对我不利。在那一刻，他说上帝正在为雅各挪移天地。如果雅各没有失去约瑟，约瑟和他的整个家庭都会被毁灭。如果雅各没有失去约瑟，整个地区都会因饥饿而死亡。

通过约瑟的丧失事件，上帝正在治愈约瑟，使他的兄弟们谦卑，并帮助整个地区经济上得到改善。他正在摧毁毁坏和扭曲雅各生活的偶像。上帝正在为雅各挪移天地。但雅各是怎么想的呢？

不，他说了什么？一切都对我不利。约瑟已经不在了。但约瑟只是被隐藏起来，他正在预备。

西缅也不在了。西缅很好，他在预备。一切都反对我。如果你拒绝相信神比你更了解一切，如果你拒绝相信他是王，如果你拒绝相信他是良善的，那么你又如何呢？

你现在看自己的生活时，感觉如何？你觉得是这样吗？你内心有什么呼喊？你说：“我现在再也找不到爱了。

”“我现在再也找不到成功了。”这些都不再存在。一切都反对我。这是你的感受吗？

这能理解吗？想想雅各吧，他就是这么觉得的，他就是这样看事情的。他是先祖，不是傻子。你也不是傻子，能有这种感觉。

但你是错的。你是错的。要小心。看看那呼喊的一面镜子。

约瑟不在了，西缅也不在了。你们要从我这里夺走便雅悯，一切都反对我。看看那个呼喊，那里有一面镜子。所以我不要像那样。

我不想这么说。朋友们，如果你明白神的计划包括坏事，包括你的选择，包括小事，并且知道神的计划控制着每一个事件直到最终目标，使耶稣基督成为一切的一切和万王之王，治愈整个宇宙，那么你就明白了预定论。如果你理解了这一点并开始在这一频率上运作，不断地提醒自己这些事情，这对你会有什么影响呢？好吧，我只想总结说，它会有三个效果。

一是会让你变得坚韧不拔，坚韧不拔。你明白神恨恶罪就像你一样，尽管它会发生，你会受伤，你会经历各种坏事。但你知道你可以输掉一场战斗，却不会输掉整个战争。看，异教徒对邪恶的看法是，那就是全部了。

现代人对邪恶的看法是它是随机的，让我们去对抗它。但是基督徒明白，我们是怀着希望战斗的。有一种倔强，你知道，最近的巴黎专辑的最后一首歌里有它，我想应该是第一面的第一首歌，歌词叫“上帝掌控一切”，虽然不是最伟大的艺术作品，但那种倔强体现在歌词中。副歌部分唱道：“上帝掌控一切。

” 我们相信他的儿女不会被抛弃。上帝掌控一切。我们选择相信，我们选择铭记并永不动摇。我们选择铭记并永不动摇。

没有什么力量在他之上或旁他。我们知道上帝掌控一切。有一种倔强，你知道，在你面对邪恶时。我们选择铭记并永不动摇。

这是你的选择。其次，还有一种满足感，即使事情变得糟糕，你也知道上帝在你身上做什么。有一本给孩子们的小书叫《绒布兔子》，在这本书里，两个玩具动物在奶酪房里对话。其中一个玩具对另一个玩具说：“什么是真正存在？

” 绒布马回答说：当你被一个孩子长时间地爱着时，就会发生这种事——不仅仅是为了玩，而是真的爱你。你变得真实了。这需要很长时间，所以通常那些容易破碎或有锋利边缘、或者需要小心保管的人，很少会变成**真正的玩具。到真正成为玩具的时候，你的大部分毛发都被爱掉了，眼睛也掉出来了，关节松了，外表很破旧，但这些都不重要，因为一旦你变得真实，即使丑陋也只是**那些不懂的人才会觉得。

你看，如果你理解基督王权的教义，你就知道你所经历的一切都是上帝让你变得更真实的方式。即使你的头发被爱掉了，眼睛掉出来了，感觉有些破旧，甚至能感觉到填充物从后面漏出来，但你知道这是他计划的一部分，包括一切。最后，这也是一个警告：上帝的预定让我们谦卑。因为你明白，神的应许是“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处”。

现在你知道这句话的意思吗？就是说，“万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处”。这话是什么意思呢？非常重要。

最后我要说的是，非常关键。希望你们现在醒醒了，好吗？如果所有发生的事情都是为了使基督成为王，对吧？每一件事的发生都是为此目的。

**这意味着什么？如果你已经让基督在你生命中成为王，如果你让他拯救你并成为你的王，如果你以此为生命的首要目标，那么世界上发生的每一件事物，每一粒沙子，每一个原子，每一个分子，每一个事件都对你有益。**万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。但如果相反，你是以自己为主，拒绝了基督的王权，即使你可能很宗教，但你是自己的主宰，你自己做决定。

如果你在反对他的王权，那么宇宙中的每一件事都在反对你，没有中间地带。要么宇宙中的每一个分子都对你有利，要么每一个分子都对你不利。你能看出来吗？你让耶稣成为你的王了吗？

那接下来呢？无论好事坏事发生在你身上，都会让你更靠近他。你知道，好事发生时，你会因为感恩而更接近神；坏事发生时，你也会更接近神。为什么？

因为这显示了你需要他的程度有多深。但我们现在来看一下拒绝基督王权的人。对他们来说，好事只会让他们觉得不需要神，坏事则让他们觉得不能信任神。所以对一个不顺服基督王权的人来说，无论是好是坏，每一件事都在硬化的你，把你推开。

你可以有一个宇宙，在那里每一个分子都对你有利，也可以每一个分子都对你不利，但中间没有第三种情况。感谢收听蒂姆·凯勒和《福音与生命》播客。如果您希望看到更多人通过这个事工的福音中心教导和资源受到鼓励，我们诚邀您考虑成为《福音与生命》的月度合作伙伴。您的支持使我们能够向世界各地的人们传递基督之爱的生命之力。
