## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else.

The scripture is found in Romans 8 verses 13 through 27. For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.

Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a Spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship, and by Him we cry, all the Father. The Spirit Himself testifies with our Spirit that we are God's children.

Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. If indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory, I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.

For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen as no hope at all, who hopes for what he already has. But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.

We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. This is the Word of the Lord.

We've been looking at Romans 678, which have to do with how the faith in Christ concretely, but profoundly changes us. And now we get here, as we're going through, Romans 678 to this subject of suffering. And it's absolutely crucial if your life is really going to be equipped in any spiritual way for real life.

We have to see how it is that faith in Christ or how it is that Christ actually does prepare you to face the brutality, is the unavoidable brutality of life. Now why talk about this at Christmas time? Suffering at Christmas time?

I'll tell you why, because if you have a burden, if you're struggling with something, Christmas time is the worst season, because you feel I'm the only one. Everybody else is happy, everybody else, but I'm the only one that's suffering. Of course, that's, as we're going to see, absolutely wrong, but it's very, very important at this time, especially at Christmas time, to look at what this text teaches us.

And it tells us three things. This text tells us, first of all, it gives us three things. One, it gives us a warning about suffering.

Secondly, it gives us three resources for suffering. And finally, it tells us how you can be sure that those resources will work. A warning about suffering, three resources for dealing with suffering, and how you can be sure that they'll work.

欢迎来到《福音人生》节目。你是否渴望在生活中、在习惯中、在人际关系中、在内心中看到真正的改变？今天,提摩太·凯勒探讨在基督徒的生命中,持久的改变实际上是如何发生的,以及为什么福音提供了一个与其他任何东西都截然不同的转变过程。

经文出自罗马书第8章13至27节。因为你们若顺从肉体活着,必要死;若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行,必要活着。

因为凡被神的灵引导的,都是神的儿子。你们所受的不是奴仆的心,仍旧害怕;所受的乃是儿子的心,因此我们呼叫:阿爸,父!圣灵与我们的心同证我们是神的儿女。

既是儿女,便是后嗣,就是神的后嗣,和基督同作后嗣。如果我们和他一同受苦,也必和他一同得荣耀。我想,现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀,就不足介意了。受造之物切望等候神的众子显出来。

因为受造之物服在虚空之下,不是自己愿意,乃是因那叫他如此的。但受造之物仍然指望脱离败坏的辖制,得享神儿女自由的荣耀。我们知道一切受造之物一同叹息、劳苦,直到如今。不但如此,就是我们这有圣灵初结果子的,也是自己心里叹息,等候得着儿子的名分,乃是我们的身体得赎。

我们得救是在乎盼望;只是所见的盼望不是盼望,谁还盼望他所见的呢?但我们若盼望那所不见的,就必忍耐等候。况且,我们的软弱有圣灵帮助。

我们本不晓得当怎样祷告,只是圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告。鉴察人心的,晓得圣灵的意思,因为圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。这是主的话语。

我们一直在看罗马书6、7、8章,这些章节涉及对基督的信心如何具体而深刻地改变我们。现在当我们研读罗马书6、7、8章时,来到了苦难这个主题。如果你的生命真的要在属灵方面为真实的人生做好准备,这是绝对关键的。

我们必须看到对基督的信心,或者说基督如何实际上使你准备好面对生命中不可避免的残酷。那么为什么在圣诞节期间谈论苦难呢?

我来告诉你为什么,因为如果你有重担,如果你正在与某事挣扎,圣诞节期间是最糟糕的季节,因为你会觉得只有我一个人这样。其他人都很快乐,其他人都好,但只有我在受苦。当然,正如我们将要看到的,这绝对是错误的,但在这个时候,特别是在圣诞节期间,看看这段经文教导我们什么是非常非常重要的。

它告诉我们三件事。这段经文首先给我们关于苦难的一个警告。

其次,它给我们三个应对苦难的资源。最后,它告诉我们如何确信这些资源会起作用。关于苦难的警告,三个应对苦难的资源,以及如何确信它们会起作用。

## 警告:苦难不可避免 / A Warning: Suffering Is Unavoidable

Okay? First, a warning. Now, this is an amazing passage very long, and I certainly can't take a look at every single thought unit, but in the middle, it talks about groaning.

And this word groaning is a very, very strong word. And it has, it's a word that means an expression of pain, and it even goes beyond that. In many cases, this word in Greek literature often is used to express the cry of someone who is facing death.

It can be a death pain. So, for example, you notice in verse 23, it's associated with a woman giving birth to a child, and we have to remember, especially in ancient times, that a woman groaning, crying out, screaming, really, as she's giving birth, is not just an expression of pain, but she's also in mortal danger, that in old, in ancient times, many, many women died in childbirth. Also this word is used to refer to the groanings of warriors on the battlefield, you know, when the fighting is done, and the smoke clears, and the noise of the battle itself is over.

One of the most horrible things that so many veterans and first-hand observers of warfare tells you, one of the most horrible things is the groaning of the people, of the soldiers, of the warriors out on the ground. They're crying out, they're groaning, because they see their blood, their lives literally, they're desperately wounded, they see their lives literally ebbing out, and they're crying out, and they're groaning, and saying, please come and staunch the wound, or I'm dead. Now, that's what this word means.

It has that connotation, it's a death pain, it's a death groan, and to our surprise, Paul actually speaks about the creation groaning. This world, this material world, not just us groaning, we do too, but our material environment, the world itself, is groaning, and it says it's groaning because it's crushed under a bondage to decay and the frustration. Now, what does that mean?

It means this. Everything, everything, not just us suffering, everything in this world is steadily, irreversibly, inexorably, unavoidably, falling apart, wearing down, wearing out, giving out everything. Now, we have this thing called the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which actually confirms this, that the universe itself is deteriorating, it's running down, it's spending far more energy than it's ever able to restore, and so everything's deteriorating, but we can be much more personal than that.

Your heart, your physical heart, you realize it's not an electric clock that just goes on. Your physical heart is like a wind-up clock, it's been wound up once, there's a finite number of ticks in it, and even as we speak, is running out. Or your body, your whole body is falling apart.

Oh, we do awful lot to, you know, retard or hide it. I mean, for example, one of the reasons you use cosmetics is you're trying to restore the color and shame that you used to have naturally as a child. You had it once, you didn't need the cosmetics, it's gone, it'll never come back.

You can hide the process, some of you can hide it extremely well, but you can't stop it. Or look at the closest circle of friends, or the tightest family. You know what time and circumstances doing?

It's picking it apart. One by one time and circumstance is going to separate you, it's going to remove you from one another. Now, what's the point?

Well, here's the point. We live in a culture in which suffering is an anomaly. We think if you're savvy, if things are working right, we shouldn't suffer.

We get, when things, when we do suffer, we get angry. We think life is mistreating us, God's mistreating us, somebody's mistreating us. But this text tells us, everything that your heart longs for, everything that your heart longs for is a wave on the sand.

It's receding from you, inevitably receding from you. It's all going to go. And you can, you know, for various, in various ways, you can you can avoid suffering for a while, maybe even in the early 30s.

But eventually, it is unavoidable. Real, bad, horrendous, groaning suffering. It's just inevitable.

It's unavoidable. So that's the lesson, a warning. You need resources.

Don't think, well, not if I'm smart, not if I'm savvy, not if I'm nimble. You need resources at a point two. What are these three resources?

The three resources that Paul tells come with Jesus. You bring Jesus into your life. You get these three resources.

We can name them under the headings, prayer, pattern, perspective. Prayer, pattern, perspective. Okay, let's go through them.

好吗?首先,警告。现在,这是一段令人惊奇的经文,很长,我当然不能看每一个思想单元,但在中间,它谈到了叹息。

这个"叹息"这个词是一个非常非常强烈的词。它的意思是痛苦的表达,甚至超越了这个意思。在许多情况下,这个词在希腊文学中经常被用来表达面临死亡的人的呼喊。

它可以是一种死亡的痛苦。所以,例如,你注意到在第23节,它与一个妇女生孩子联系在一起,我们必须记住,特别是在古代,一个妇女在生孩子时呻吟、哭喊、尖叫,实际上不仅仅是痛苦的表达,而且她也处于致命的危险之中,在古代,许多许多妇女死于分娩。这个词也被用来指战场上战士的呻吟,你知道,当战斗结束,硝烟散去,战斗本身的噪音结束后。

许多退伍军人和战争的第一手观察者告诉你,最可怕的事情之一就是人们的呻吟,士兵们、战士们在地上的呻吟。他们在哭喊,他们在呻吟,因为他们看到自己的血,他们的生命实际上在流逝,他们受了致命伤,他们看到自己的生命在流逝,他们在哭喊,他们在呻吟,说,请来止住伤口,否则我就要死了。现在,这就是这个词的意思。

它有这种含义,它是一种死亡的痛苦,它是一种死亡的呻吟,令我们惊讶的是,保罗实际上谈到了受造之物的呻吟。这个世界,这个物质世界,不仅仅是我们在呻吟,我们也在呻吟,而且我们的物质环境,世界本身,也在呻吟,它说它在呻吟,因为它被压在败坏的辖制和虚空之下。现在,这是什么意思?

它的意思是这样。一切,一切,不仅仅是我们在受苦,这个世界上的一切都在稳定地、不可逆转地、不可阻挡地、不可避免地崩溃、磨损、耗尽、失效。现在,我们有这个叫做热力学第二定律的东西,实际上证实了这一点,宇宙本身在恶化,在衰退,它消耗的能量远远超过它能够恢复的,所以一切都在恶化,但我们可以更个人化地看这个问题。

你的心脏,你的肉体心脏,你意识到它不是一个永远运转的电子钟。你的肉体心脏就像一个上发条的钟,它只上过一次发条,它里面有有限次数的滴答声,即使在我们说话的时候,也在耗尽。或者你的身体,你的整个身体都在崩溃。

哦,我们做了很多事情来延缓或隐藏它。我的意思是,例如,你使用化妆品的原因之一是你试图恢复你小时候自然拥有的颜色和光泽。你曾经拥有过,你不需要化妆品,它消失了,永远不会回来。

你可以隐藏这个过程,你们中的一些人可以隐藏得非常好,但你无法阻止它。或者看看最亲密的朋友圈,或最紧密的家庭。你知道时间和环境在做什么吗?

它在把它撕开。时间和环境将一个接一个地把你们分开,把你们彼此分离。现在,重点是什么?

嗯,重点是这样。我们生活在一个文化中,在这个文化中,苦难是一种反常现象。我们认为如果你聪明,如果事情运转正常,我们就不应该受苦。

当我们受苦时,我们会生气。我们认为生活在虐待我们,上帝在虐待我们,有人在虐待我们。但这段经文告诉我们,你心所渴望的一切,你心所渴望的一切都是沙滩上的波浪。

它在从你身边退去,不可避免地从你身边退去。一切都会消失。你知道,你可以用各种方式避免受苦一段时间,也许甚至到30岁出头。

但最终,它是不可避免的。真正的、糟糕的、可怕的、呻吟的苦难。它只是不可避免的。

它是不可避免的。所以这就是教训,一个警告。你需要资源。

不要想,嗯,如果我聪明,如果我精明,如果我灵活,就不会。你需要资源。第二点。这三个资源是什么?

保罗告诉我们,与耶稣一起来的三个资源。你把耶稣带入你的生命。你就得到这三个资源。

我们可以在以下标题下命名它们:祷告、模式、视角。祷告、模式、视角。好,让我们逐一看一看。

## 资源一:借祷告处理苦难 / Resource One: Processing Suffering Through Prayer

First of all, prayer. When you suffer, you can process the suffering through prayer. Well, of course you say, everybody prays.

I mean, there's that, I mean, you know, the statistics tell us, you know, how many people, what a high percentage of people pray. And of course, there's that, I know it's an exaggeration and it's kind of an unfair exaggeration. There are no atheists and foxholes.

I know a number of atheists that are particularly irritated by that statement. It's really not fair. It's definitely an exaggeration, but it's trying to get at something.

And that is that when troubles happen, those of us who ordinarily don't pray, try. But generally, when problems happen, it's emergency flare prayer. You know, it's like, if there's anybody up there help, you know, that's how we pray.

This is talking about something else. Something very, very different. At the beginning at the end of the passage, at the beginning of the passage, we are told about Abba prayer.

Now, it says, you notice up here in verse 14 and 15, it says that you've received the spirit of sonship and by him, that's the spirit, holy spirit, we cry Abba, Father. Now, what's the Abba? That is a universal language, you know, that in every culture, no matter what your culture, no matter what your language background.

Basically, when a little baby finally gives a name to one of the parents, it always comes out kind of like this. Abba, Abba, Dada, something like that. What is this saying?

Here's what it's saying. It's saying that because of what Jesus Christ has done for you, because of what it means to be in Jesus Christ, when you grow, when you cry, when you scream, even like Job who cries out in rather unattractive ways, that when you cry in Christ, God the Father hears that cry the way a parent hears the cry of his or her child. When your child screams and pain, what do you do?

You say, oh gosh, no. When you sense, I mean, you know, there's, listen, there's all kinds of cries. There's, you get to know them after, you know, even I, you know, even a father gets to know the cries, and there's, there's the I'm irritated cry where I want some attention cry, and then there's the I'm in trouble cry.

And, and it's not like you love your child more when your child gives the I'm in trouble cry. I mean, you can't really love your child more principally, but your love is stirred. It's intensified.

And this is telling us that even, in spite of how you feel, when you're suffering, when you're in trouble, you can know that God responds to your groaning the way a parent responds to the cry of pain of his or her child. There's an intense love and intense care. Absolutely.

Can you code a God with that kind of confidence of that kind of care, that kind of attention, that kind of love, but that's not the only kind of prayer that we're given here. We're told not just about, you know, Abba prayer, but look at the end. Very, very interesting and very little odd at first.

It says when we're weak, and when we do not know what we ought to pray for, the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. What is that talking about? Now, you know, some people have said that this is the spirit helping you pray in tongues, and even though with all due respect to my charismatic brothers and sisters, there's plenty of other passages that talk about tongues, but I don't believe this is one of them because it's not talking about a sound that we make.

This isn't us making a sound. This is the spirit praying, not us praying. This is the spirit praying interceding, means for us doing something in our place.

What is it? When we don't know how to pray, the spirit lays out our petitions before the throne as they ought to be coming. Now, some of you know this story.

The first year out of college, I had a relationship with this girl, and she wanted to break up. So I prayed so fervently in great groaning and pain, really. Oh, Lord, please don't break up this relationship.

Please don't break up this relationship. Now, of course, in hindsight, it was an absolutely stupid prayer. This is a different girl than Kathy, who was my wife who I finally married, and it's a good thing that the relationship broke up, but that's not how I felt at the time.

So God didn't answer my prayers. Is that right? I mean, he denied my prayers.

Is that right? Yes and no, because listen, there's always a core part to a prayer, and then there's the stupid part. And the core part, see the core part is the groan.

The core part is help me. I think this is what I need to be the man you want me to be or you know, the person you want me to be. I think this is what I need.

And that's, you know, so please help me be this and please give me this and please please help me. That's the core part. And then there's a stupid part.

And I happen to think that this is the girl that will do that. And there's a certain sense in which what? Did he answer my prayer or not?

Wouldn't it be great if God always gave you what you would have asked for if you knew everything he knows? Wouldn't it be great if God was so gracious that every time you prayed, he would give you and only give you thank goodness because we're so stupid so often. Wouldn't it be great if you had a God who gave you and only gave you what you would have asked for if you knew every single thing that he knew and you saw everything that he could see?

We do have a God like that because that's what that text is saying. It's saying the spirit, even when you don't know how to pray, the spirit takes that core, the spirit prays as you should be praying before the throne. And here's what this means.

When you suffer, can you come before God with that kind of confidence to know that he is going to give you what you would have asked for? In spite of the fact that right now you probably don't think what he is letting you experience is a good idea, but he is going to give you what you would have asked for if you knew everything that he knew and he does care and he does love you. He loves you intensely.

If you are able to process your suffering before God like that, there will be a calm, there will be a groundedness. Okay, that's your first resource, but that's not the only one. There's another one.

---

首先,祷告。当你受苦时,你可以通过祷告来处理苦难。当然你会说,每个人都祷告。

我的意思是,你知道,统计数据告诉我们,你知道,有多少人,有多高比例的人祷告。当然,有那句话,我知道这是一种夸张,而且是一种不公平的夸张。散兵坑里没有无神论者。

我知道许多无神论者对这句话特别恼火。这真的不公平。这绝对是一种夸张,但它试图表达一些东西。

那就是当麻烦发生时,我们这些平时不祷告的人会尝试。但通常,当问题发生时,这是紧急求救的祷告。你知道,就像,如果上面有人的话,请帮助,你知道,这就是我们祷告的方式。

这里谈论的是别的东西。非常非常不同的东西。在这段经文的开头和结尾,在经文的开头,我们被告知关于阿爸的祷告。

现在,它说,你注意到在这里第14和15节,它说你们所受的乃是儿子的心,因此,就是圣灵,圣灵,我们呼叫:阿爸,父!现在,阿爸是什么?这是一种通用语言,你知道,在每一种文化中,无论你的文化是什么,无论你的语言背景是什么。

基本上,当一个小婴儿最终给父母之一起名字时,它总是这样出来的。阿爸,阿爸,爸爸,诸如此类的。这在说什么?

这是在说。它在说,因为耶稣基督为你所做的,因为在耶稣基督里的意义,当你呻吟,当你哭泣,当你尖叫,甚至像约伯那样以相当不吸引人的方式哭喊时,当你在基督里哭喊时,父神听到那个哭喊,就像父母听到他或她的孩子的哭喊一样。当你的孩子尖叫和痛苦时,你会怎么做?

你说,哦天哪,不。当你感觉到,我的意思是,你知道,有各种各样的哭声。有,在你知道了之后,你知道,即使我,你知道,即使一个父亲也能了解这些哭声,有,有我很烦躁的哭声,我想要一些关注的哭声,然后有我有麻烦的哭声。

而且,你并不是说当你的孩子发出我有麻烦的哭声时你更爱你的孩子。我的意思是,你不能真正在原则上更爱你的孩子,但你的爱被激发了。它被强化了。

这告诉我们,即使,尽管你的感受如何,当你受苦时,当你有麻烦时,你可以知道上帝对你的呻吟的回应,就像父母对他或她的孩子的痛苦哭声的回应一样。有一种强烈的爱和强烈的关怀。绝对。

你能以那种信心、那种关怀、那种关注、那种爱向上帝呼求吗?但这不是我们在这里得到的唯一一种祷告。我们不仅被告知关于,你知道,阿爸的祷告,而且看结尾。非常非常有趣,起初有点奇怪。

它说当我们软弱时,当我们不晓得当怎样祷告时,圣灵亲自用说不出来的叹息替我们祷告,圣灵照着神的旨意替圣徒祈求。这在说什么?现在,你知道,有些人说这是圣灵帮助你用方言祷告,尽管我非常尊重我灵恩派的弟兄姊妹,有很多其他经文谈到方言,但我不相信这是其中之一,因为它不是在谈论我们发出的声音。

这不是我们在祷告。这是圣灵在祷告,不是我们在祷告。这是圣灵在祷告,代求的意思是为我们做一些事情,代替我们。

这是什么?当我们不知道如何祷告时,圣灵按照应该的方式在宝座前摆出我们的请求。现在,你们中的一些人知道这个故事。

大学毕业后的第一年,我和这个女孩有一段关系,她想分手。所以我非常热切地祷告,在极大的呻吟和痛苦中,真的。哦,主啊,请不要让这段关系破裂。

请不要让这段关系破裂。现在,当然,事后看来,这是一个绝对愚蠢的祷告。这是一个不同的女孩,不是凯西,凯西是我的妻子,我最终娶了她,这段关系破裂是一件好事,但那不是我当时的感受。

所以上帝没有回答我的祷告。对吗?我的意思是,他拒绝了我的祷告。

对吗?是也不是,因为听着,祷告总是有一个核心部分,然后有愚蠢的部分。核心部分,看核心部分是呻吟。

核心部分是帮助我。我认为这是我需要成为你希望我成为的男人,或者你知道,你希望我成为的人。我认为这是我需要的。

所以,你知道,所以请帮助我成为这样,请给我这个,请请帮助我。这是核心部分。然后有愚蠢的部分。

我恰好认为这个女孩会做到这一点。从某种意义上说,什么?他回答我的祷告了吗?

如果上帝总是给你你会要求的东西,如果你知道他知道的一切,那不是很好吗?如果上帝如此仁慈,以至于每次你祷告时,他都会给你,只给你,谢天谢地,因为我们经常如此愚蠢。如果你有一个上帝,他给你,只给你你会要求的东西,如果你知道他知道的每一件事,你看到他能看到的一切,那不是很好吗?

我们确实有这样一位上帝,因为这就是那段经文在说的。它在说圣灵,即使当你不知道如何祷告时,圣灵取那个核心,圣灵按照你应该祷告的方式在宝座前祷告。这意味着什么。

当你受苦时,你能以那种信心来到上帝面前,知道他将给你你会要求的东西吗?尽管现在你可能不认为他让你经历的是一个好主意,但他将给你你会要求的东西,如果你知道他知道的一切,而且他确实关心,他确实爱你。他强烈地爱你。

如果你能够像那样在上帝面前处理你的苦难,就会有一种平静,会有一种踏实感。好的,这是你的第一个资源,但这不是唯一的。还有另一个。

## 资源二:死而复活的模式 / Resource Two: The Death-Resurrection Pattern

The second resource is a pattern. Now what do we mean by a pattern? Well, Paul was a pastor and therefore I do understand this part because I'm a pastor too.

Constantly, there are people who come to pastors and say, if God really loves me, why are all these problems happening to me? If God really loves me, why the tragedy, why the suffering? If he loves me in Jesus like you say, why all this?

Paul in verse 17 turns the tables. He doesn't say in verse 17, oh, suffering doesn't disprove the gospel. He doesn't just say that.

He says, suffering is a sign that you're a Christian. It's not just, oh, you're a Christian in spite of the suffering. He says, suffering is a sign you're a Christian.

And look what he says. He says, now we're children if we share in his sufferings. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you to Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Suffering is a sign that we're his child.

You say, well, wait a minute. I just let you said, wasn't your point one? After all, I do listen to you.

Wasn't point one that everybody suffers that it's inevitable. Notice his sufferings that lead to glory. What is that?

There was a pattern in Jesus' life. The pattern in Jesus' life was rejection. You know, his family didn't understand him.

His friends didn't understand him. He was despised. He was rejected.

He wasn't beautiful. He had no form by which we should desire him. You know, he was a victim of injustice.

I mean, he had one one suffering after another after another. But his attitude was not my will but time be done. He was faithful.

He was trusting. He was obedient. And as a result, his death led to life, his weakness led to strength.

There was a death resurrection pattern. And what Paul is saying is, if you do the same, then you share in his sufferings. And what does that mean?

It means the things that come into your life actually change you. The weakness turns to strength. You know, when you're doing bicep curls, do you know you're honestly actually getting stronger?

In spite of the fact that it feels like it's getting weaker and weaker, it's getting stronger and stronger. Well, how does that happen? You know, I really don't understand physiology well enough to explain.

Somebody out there, because this is New York, and there's all these smart people, and there's a professional trainer, and you've got to tell me all about the amino acids and your muscles or something. I don't know why, but I do know it's exactly this way. When Paul says in Romans 5, he just said it just a few verses before, now we always rejoice in our sufferings.

By the way, notice, he didn't say we rejoice for our sufferings. This is not massacism. This isn't spiritual massacism.

We, I'm suffering, no. We always rejoice in our sufferings because we know that our sufferings produce perseverance and perseverance character and character hope, and hope does not disappoint us because God has poured out His love into our hearts by His Holy Spirit, which He has given us. An acorn has got so much potential in it.

You know, in the acorn, there's enough power to create this huge tree with hundreds of other acorns, each of which can produce a tree with hundreds of other acorns and hundreds of other acorns. In other words, a single acorn has the power to cover the entire earth with wood. And yet, that acorn's potential can't be released unless it goes into the ground and dies, and the Bible is constantly talking about that, unless you're humbled, unless you're broken of your self-sufficiency.

You are the image of God, and you have potential for understanding and wisdom and insight and compassion for other people. You have the potential for greatness and for joy, real joy and hope and character. And what we're being told here is unless that goes into the soil of difficulty and trial, without weakness, there will never be strength.

Without death, there will never be a resurrection, but it's possible if you share in His suffering, if you follow His pattern, if you do it looking to Him, remembering Him, seeing what He did, following Him, believing in Him, trusting Him, then what happens? What actually happens is you become a diamond under that pressure. That's what it's saying.

So first of all, you've got the processing through prayer. And if you process it through prayer, then you have the hope of this pattern actually being reproduced in your life, but that's not all.

---

第二个资源是一个模式。现在我们所说的模式是什么意思?嗯,保罗是一个牧师,因此我确实理解这一部分,因为我也是一个牧师。

不断地,有人来找牧师说,如果上帝真的爱我,为什么所有这些问题都发生在我身上?如果上帝真的爱我,为什么有悲剧,为什么有苦难?如果他像你说的那样在耶稣里爱我,为什么会有这一切?

保罗在第17节扭转了局面。他不是在第17节说,哦,苦难不能反驳福音。他不只是说那个。

他说,苦难是你是基督徒的标志。不仅仅是,哦,尽管受苦你还是基督徒。他说,苦难是你是基督徒的标志。

看他说什么。他说,现在我们是儿女,如果我们和他一同受苦。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你接近上帝的方式。

甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一种情况,包括死亡。在提摩太和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修书《耶稣的诗歌》中,你会发现每天通过诗篇阅读,带有新鲜的圣经见解。如果你没有定期的灵修习惯,这本书是一个很好的开始方式。

如果你已经花时间学习和祷告,那么阅读和通过诗篇祷告可以帮助你把你最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前,并发现与他的新层次的亲密关系。我们会把提摩太和凯西·凯勒的灵修书送给你,作为对你帮助福音人生与更多人分享耶稣的爱的礼物的感谢。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本,就是gospelandlife.com/give。

现在这里是凯勒博士和今天教导的其余部分。苦难是我们是他的孩子的标志。

你说,等一下。我刚让你说了,你的第一点不是吗?毕竟,我确实听你讲。

第一点不是每个人都受苦,它是不可避免的吗?注意他的苦难,那些导致荣耀的苦难。那是什么?

耶稣的生命中有一个模式。耶稣生命中的模式是拒绝。你知道,他的家人不理解他。

他的朋友不理解他。他被藐视。他被拒绝。

他不美丽。他没有我们应该渴慕他的形式。你知道,他是不公正的受害者。

我的意思是,他一个接一个地受苦。但他的态度不是我的意愿,而是你的旨意成就。他是忠诚的。

他是信任的。他是顺服的。结果,他的死导致了生命,他的软弱导致了力量。

有一个死而复活的模式。保罗在说的是,如果你做同样的事,那么你就分享他的苦难。这意味着什么?

这意味着进入你生命的事情实际上改变了你。软弱变成力量。你知道,当你做二头肌弯举时,你知道你实际上真的在变强吗?

尽管感觉它越来越弱,它越来越强。嗯,这是怎么发生的?你知道,我真的不太了解生理学来解释。

在座的某个人,因为这是纽约,有所有这些聪明人,有一个专业教练,你得告诉我关于氨基酸和你的肌肉之类的。我不知道为什么,但我确实知道它完全是这样。当保罗在罗马书5章说时,他就在几节之前说过,现在我们总是在苦难中喜乐。

顺便说一下,注意,他没有说我们为我们的苦难喜乐。这不是受虐狂。这不是属灵的受虐狂。

我们,我在受苦,不。我们总是在苦难中喜乐,因为我们知道苦难生忍耐,忍耐生品格,品格生盼望,盼望不至于羞耻,因为所赐给我们的圣灵将神的爱浇灌在我们心里。一颗橡子有如此大的潜力。

你知道,在橡子里,有足够的力量来创造这棵巨大的树,有数百个其他橡子,每一个都可以产生一棵有数百个其他橡子和数百个其他橡子的树。换句话说,一颗橡子有覆盖整个地球的木材的力量。然而,那颗橡子的潜力不能被释放,除非它进入地里死亡,圣经不断地谈论这一点,除非你被降卑,除非你的自给自足被打破。

你是上帝的形象,你有理解、智慧、洞察力和对他人的同情心的潜力。你有伟大和喜乐、真正的喜乐和盼望和品格的潜力。我们在这里被告知的是,除非那进入困难和试炼的土壤中,没有软弱,就永远不会有力量。

没有死亡,就永远不会有复活,但如果你分享他的苦难,如果你遵循他的模式,如果你仰望他,记住他,看到他所做的,跟随他,相信他,信任他,那么会发生什么?实际上会发生什么是你在那种压力下成为一颗钻石。这就是它在说的。

所以首先,你通过祷告来处理。如果你通过祷告处理它,那么你就有希望这个模式实际上在你的生命中被复制,但这还不是全部。

## 资源三:将来荣耀的视角 / Resource Three: The Perspective of Future Glory

The third resource is prayer, pattern, perspective.

And this is the most powerful. Paul's constantly saying what you need in order to handle your suffering is hope. You need patience.

He says you have to look to the future, but the best thing he says is it's amazing verse 18. Now I consider, in that word consider means consider. It means it's a word, it's a Greek word that means to reckon.

It means to count. It means it's an accounting word. It means to add it up and to count on it and to think about it and reflect it and make sure you see every fast and every aspect, every penny.

I consider that our present suffering is not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. Now we did a whole sermon series on this two years ago, but here's the basic idea. Imagine two rooms and you put two people in these two rooms and you give them absolutely identical tasks.

Menial, boring, difficult, manual labor. And you say you're going to work 80 hours a day. You're going to have no vacation for 12 months in this room.

It's going to be boring. It's going to be tedious. It's going to be so horribly hard.

And so you put them both into their into those rooms and they get started. And you say to the first guy, and at the end of the 12 months, you will get an annual salary $15,000 and you say to the second guy, and at the end of the 12 months, you will get your annual salary $150 million. And those two guys are going to experience that those identical circumstances in radically different ways.

Because the first guy after about three or four weeks is going to say, who could take anything like this? This is so hard. It's driving me crazy.

I can't take it anymore. I quit. And the other guy is over there whistling.

No problem. At all. Wait a minute.

It's the same circumstances. Why? Because the tediousness, the difficulty, the trial of it, is being absolutely overshadowed outweighed by the glory that will be revealed.

In other words, how you experience your present is completely shaped by what you believe your ultimate future to be. Completely. And if you rest the deepest hopes of your heart in anything but God, if the deepest hopes of your heart is anything but God, if it's a political cause, if it's a relationship, if it's anything, if it's a career, if it's writing the great American novel, if you put the deepest hopes of your heart in anything but God, it's a thing of this world.

And it will be subject to suffering. And no matter how strong you think you are, no matter how much you are stoic, no matter how stoic you are, suffering will take you out. And there will be an anxiety ground note for your entire life.

Your whole life will be characterized by a ground note of anxiety. But if this is what you believe you're in for, what? God's future and what is it?

Oh, my word. Oh my goodness. Do you see what it's saying?

It says creation. Now, creation is subject to the K. Creation is awfully nice.

I mean, when you look at the Grand Canyon, or you listen to the ocean, or you look at the snow cap mountains, you know, it's pretty glorious. And yet this has the audacity to say, the creation itself is just a shadow of what's going to be, just a shadow that's a disease and the viruses and the nature, red and tooth and claws, is not what it originally was intended to be. So creation is groaning, right?

What's going to liberate it? Look what verse 21 says. It's waiting for our liberation.

We are groaning inwardly for the redemption of our bodies. And so is nature. In other words, some kind of glory is going to come down on us on the last day.

We are going to be so become so radiant, so cleansed, so great. What do I mean by that? You know that if you have five senses and somebody else has four senses like his blind or deaf or just like the difference between five senses and four senses is huge.

You know, in your ability to handle life and your ability to enjoy life, the difference between five senses and four senses is huge. But obviously when we're glorified, we'll probably have a thousand senses. And what you're going to be like then, you know, compared to what you are now compared to what you're going to be like then, you're a tomato.

You know, you're a zucchini. There's going to be a glory, almost like a bomb of glory that comes down on us and it's going to be so astounding that it is going to transform material universe as well. Where it's our glory is going to bring nature with it.

And this is a material thing. The whole idea is bodies, redeem bodies, a glorious creation. We're not just getting heaven, because see heaven as great as heaven would be, an ethereal spiritual heaven, heaven would just be a consolation for the life we've lost, or even the life we never had, but resurrection is the restoration of it.

It's the undoing of everything that's wrong. It'll make everything sad come untrue, everything. It's landscapes and it's hugs and it's feasts and it's not just getting back the things that we've lost.

It's doing the things that we never could do. You know, it's writing finally the poetry of always wanting to write. It's performing the music that you never were good enough to perform, or to compose.

And that's the reason why Lewis puts it like this in his great essay, The Weight of Glory. He says, if we take the scripture seriously, if we believe that God will one day give us the morning star and cause us to put on the splendor of the sun, then we may surmise that both the ancient myths and the modern poetry, so false's history will be very near the truth as prophecy. At present, we are on the outside of the world.

We're on the wrong side of the door. We discern the freshness and purity and beauty of the morning, but they do not make us fresh and pure and beautiful. We cannot mingle with the splendors we see, but all the pages of the New Testament are wrestling with the rumor that it will not always be so.

Someday, God willing, we shall get in. And when human souls have become as perfect and voluntary obedience as the inanimate creation is in its lifeless obedience, then they will put on its glory, or rather that greater glory, yes, of which nature itself is now only the first sketch. We are summoned to pass in through nature and beyond her into that glory which she so fitfully reflects.

Do you believe that? I don't believe it anything like I ought to, but I'll tell you this, to the degree it's real to me in prayer, to the degree I grasp it and understand it and think about it and celebrate it. To that degree, it overshadows the tedious circumstances of my life in that little room.

Perspective, grasp it, prayer, process it, and then you will find that suffering only reproduces the pattern of weakness into strength and mediocrity into greatness of character in your life that you see in Jesus Christ, death, into life. Now, finally, you say, well, wow, okay, but how do I know? I mean, you know, here you are a preacher and you're telling me that God sees me in Christ as a child.

But listen, when I suffer, I don't feel that God loves me, or you say in the future, there's going to be this great glory, well, when I suffer, I don't feel it at all. It's unreal to me. I feel maybe even unworthy of it.

第三个资源是祷告、模式、视角。

这是最有力的。保罗不断地说,为了处理你的苦难,你需要的是盼望。你需要耐心。

他说你必须展望未来,但他说的最好的是第18节,令人惊奇。现在我想,在那个词想中意味着想。它的意思是一个希腊词,意思是计算。

它意味着计数。它的意思是一个会计词。它意味着把它加起来,计算它,思考它,反思它,并确保你看到每一个事实和每一个方面,每一分钱。

我想,现在的苦楚若比起将来要显于我们的荣耀,就不足介意了。现在我们两年前做了一整个系列的讲道,但基本的想法是这样的。想象两个房间,你把两个人放在这两个房间里,你给他们完全相同的任务。

卑微的、无聊的、困难的、体力劳动。你说你将每天工作80小时。你将在这个房间里12个月没有假期。

这将是无聊的。这将是乏味的。这将是如此可怕的困难。

所以你把他们都放进那些房间,他们开始工作。你对第一个人说,在12个月结束时,你将获得年薪15,000美元,你对第二个人说,在12个月结束时,你将获得年薪1.5亿美元。这两个人将以截然不同的方式体验那些相同的环境。

因为第一个人大约三四周后会说,谁能忍受这样的事情?这太难了。它让我发疯。

我再也受不了了。我放弃。另一个人在那里吹口哨。

完全没问题。等一下。

这是同样的环境。为什么?因为它的乏味、困难、试炼,被将要显明的荣耀完全遮蔽、超过。

换句话说,你如何体验你的现在完全由你相信你的终极未来是什么所塑造。完全。如果你把你心中最深的希望寄托在上帝以外的任何东西上,如果你心中最深的希望是上帝以外的任何东西,如果它是一个政治事业,如果它是一段关系,如果它是任何东西,如果它是一个职业,如果它是写伟大的美国小说,如果你把你心中最深的希望寄托在上帝以外的任何东西上,它是这个世界的东西。

它将受到苦难的影响。无论你认为你有多强大,无论你有多坚忍,无论你多么坚忍,苦难都会击垮你。你的整个生命将有一个焦虑的基调。

你的整个生命将以一个焦虑的基调为特征。但如果这是你相信你将得到的,什么?上帝的未来,它是什么?

哦,我的天。哦我的天哪。你看到它在说什么吗?

它说受造之物。现在,受造之物服在败坏之下。受造之物是非常好的。

我的意思是,当你看大峡谷,或你听海洋,或你看雪山,你知道,它是相当荣耀的。然而这有胆量说,受造之物本身只是将要来的东西的影子,只是一个影子,那是疾病和病毒和自然,红色的牙齿和爪子,不是它原本应该是的。所以受造之物在呻吟,对吗?

什么将解放它?看第21节说什么。它在等待我们的解放。

我们在内心叹息,等候我们身体的救赎。自然也是如此。换句话说,某种荣耀将在末日降临到我们身上。

我们将变得如此光芒四射,如此洁净,如此伟大。我这是什么意思?你知道,如果你有五种感官,而别人有四种感官,比如他是盲人或聋子,就像五种感官和四种感官之间的差异是巨大的。

你知道,在你处理生活和享受生活的能力方面,五种感官和四种感官之间的差异是巨大的。但显然,当我们得荣耀时,我们可能会有一千种感官。你将成为什么样子,你知道,与你现在相比,与你将成为什么样子相比,你是一个西红柿。

你知道,你是一个西葫芦。将有一个荣耀,几乎像一个荣耀的炸弹降临在我们身上,它将是如此惊人,以至于它将改变物质宇宙。我们的荣耀将把自然带上。

这是一个物质的东西。整个想法是身体,得赎的身体,荣耀的受造之物。我们不只是得到天堂,因为看天堂,尽管天堂会很伟大,一个虚无缥缈的属灵天堂,天堂只会是对我们失去的生命,甚至我们从未拥有的生命的安慰,但复活是它的恢复。

它是一切错误的撤销。它会使一切悲伤的事情变得不真实,一切。它是风景,它是拥抱,它是盛宴,它不只是取回我们失去的东西。

它是做我们从未能做的事情。你知道,它是最终写出一直想写的诗歌。它是表演你从未足够好去表演或作曲的音乐。

这就是为什么路易斯在他伟大的文章《荣耀的重量》中这样说的。他说,如果我们认真对待圣经,如果我们相信上帝有一天会给我们晨星,使我们穿上太阳的光辉,那么我们可以推测,古代神话和现代诗歌,作为历史如此虚假,将非常接近真理作为预言。目前,我们在世界的外面。

我们在门的错误一边。我们辨别早晨的清新、纯洁和美丽,但它们不能使我们清新、纯洁和美丽。我们不能与我们看到的光辉混合,但新约的所有页面都在与这样一个谣言搏斗:它不会永远如此。

有一天,上帝愿意,我们将进入。当人的灵魂在完美和自愿的顺服中,就像无生命的受造之物在其无生命的顺服中一样,那么他们将穿上它的荣耀,或者更确切地说,那更大的荣耀,是的,自然本身现在只是它的第一个草图。我们被召唤穿过自然,超越她,进入她如此断断续续地反映的那个荣耀。

你相信吗?我不相信我应该相信的那样,但我会告诉你这个,在祷告中它对我来说是真实的程度,我掌握它、理解它、思考它和庆祝它的程度。到那个程度,它遮蔽了我在那个小房间里生活的乏味环境。

视角,掌握它,祷告,处理它,然后你会发现苦难只会在你的生命中重现你在耶稣基督身上看到的软弱变成力量和平庸变成伟大品格的模式,死亡,变成生命。现在,最后,你说,嗯,哇,好的,但我怎么知道?我的意思是,你知道,你在这里是一个传道人,你告诉我上帝在基督里把我看作一个孩子。

但听着,当我受苦时,我感觉不到上帝爱我,或者你说在未来,将有这个伟大的荣耀,嗯,当我受苦时,我一点也感觉不到。对我来说它是不真实的。我甚至觉得可能不配得到它。

## 圣灵的叹息:圣诞与十字架 / The Spirit Groans: Christmas and the Cross

How can I be sure these resources will work? Here's all I can tell you from this text. Notice it says that the Spirit of God groans.

That's amazing. It's not just creation of groans and it's not just we, the grown, the Spirit of God groans. And that's weird because remember, groaning, the word grown means a death pain.

It means a person in mortal danger of dying, it means a person in enormous agony and pain. How can the Spirit of God, how can God who is immortal and eternal? An omnipotent and infinite possibly grown.

How could an omnipotent God know what it's like to be a woman screaming out in labor knowing that she may be about to be giving her life in order to bring a new life into the world? How could God know the agony and groaning of the warrior out on the battlefield, crying out for rescue, but knowing he's probably just given his life for his people in battle and he sees. How could God know that kind of suffering?

How could that God know that kind of groaning and pain? You know what the answer is? Christmas.

That's what Christmas is all about, you know? I know in New York it's not, I mean what New York, New York surrounds you with Christmas, but of course New York Christmas means shop, shop, shop, all right. But here's what Christmas really means that God was plunged into an ocean of vulnerability.

He came into this groaning world. He came in and he was subject to rejection and to weakness. He was subject to hunger.

He's subject to alienation, to torture eventually and a death. And there's a place in Mark chapter 7 when Jesus is healing a man who's a deaf mute and he's a suffering man. There's a place some of you might remember where Jesus looks to heaven and it says he's size, but the word is literally in the Greek groaned.

He's already groaning because he's come into the world and he's standing alongside of sufferers and he's feeling, he's empathizing with what they're going through, but it's on the cross that he went all the way because on the cross Jesus Christ says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? But he's quoting Psalm 22 verse 1 when he's on the cross. He quotes a verse from Psalm 22 verse 1 and here's the whole verse.

My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me? Why are you so far from the words of my groaning?

Jesus Christ on the cross was a warrior on the ultimate battlefield. Isaiah 53 says he went forth to hand, he went forth to face our enemies. Evil and sin and death and he was crushed by them and now he's groaning, see, he's groaning, he's dying and he calls out and no one comes.

You know why? The Bible says this was God absorbing in himself the penalty that the human race has for all of the evil that we've done to each other, to the world, even to God. He was paying the penalty of our sins, so now you can know because Jesus Christ was abandoned in his groaning, you never will be because Jesus Christ was forsaken in his death groan.

When you groan, the Father hears it, the way a mother or father hears the cry of a child and he loves you and he hears the inarticulate cry and he takes the stupid part of the petition and drops it and he answers what you would have asked for if you were smart enough to know and he surrounds you and he makes you something great through the suffering and someday he's going to put an end to it. Jesus Christ died on the cross, so someday God could enter end evil and suffering in this world without ending us. Do you believe that?

If you do, you can sing this one song out of Ralph Vaughan Williams, there's a line in one of his songs where it goes like this. When the strife is fierce and the warfare long steals on the ear the distant triumph song, then hearts are brave again and arms are strong. In the midst of the strife you think about that future, the distant triumph song, get the perspective, process through prayer and the pattern of Jesus Christ will reproduce in your life, that's how you can handle it, even in Christmas, let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this set of resources and assuring us that they will work because of what your son did for us on the cross. Thank you for coming into the world, immersing yourself in our suffering, at Christmas it must have been such a shock to the omnipotent soul of Jesus Christ to become a helpless baby, to come into this world. But we thank you for doing that, and at Christmas we draw all the infinite consolation and strength from it to face whatever life is to us, and we thank you that we can do that through the Holy Spirit and through Jesus and his name that we pray, amen.

我怎么能确定这些资源会起作用?这是我能从这段经文告诉你的全部。注意它说上帝的灵呻吟。

这太惊人了。不仅受造之物在呻吟,不仅我们在呻吟,上帝的灵也在呻吟。这很奇怪,因为记住,呻吟,呻吟这个词意味着死亡的痛苦。

它意味着一个人处于致命的死亡危险中,它意味着一个人处于巨大的痛苦和痛苦中。上帝的灵,不朽和永恒的上帝怎么可能呻吟?全能和无限的怎么可能呻吟。

一个全能的上帝怎么能知道一个妇女在分娩中尖叫是什么感觉,知道她可能即将献出她的生命,以便将一个新生命带到世界上?上帝怎么能知道战场上战士的痛苦和呻吟,你知道,为他的人民在战斗中呼求救援,但知道他可能刚刚献出了他的生命,他看到了。上帝怎么能知道那种苦难?

上帝怎么能知道那种呻吟和痛苦?你知道答案是什么吗?圣诞节。

这就是圣诞节的全部意义,你知道吗?我知道在纽约不是,我的意思是纽约,纽约用圣诞节包围你,但当然纽约圣诞节意味着购物,购物,购物,好吧。但这是圣诞节的真正含义,上帝被投入到一个脆弱的海洋中。

他来到这个呻吟的世界。他来了,他受到拒绝和软弱的影响。他受到饥饿的影响。

他受到疏远的影响,最终受到折磨和死亡。在马可福音第7章有一个地方,当耶稣正在医治一个聋哑人,他是一个受苦的人。有一个地方,你们中的一些人可能记得,耶稣望天,它说他叹息,但这个词在希腊语中字面上是呻吟。

他已经在呻吟,因为他来到世界,他站在受苦的人旁边,他在感受,他在同情他们正在经历的,但在十字架上他走到了尽头,因为在十字架上耶稣基督说,我的神,我的神,你为什么离弃我?但他在十字架上引用诗篇22篇第1节。他引用诗篇22篇第1节的一节经文,这是整节经文。

我的神,我的神,你为什么离弃我?为什么远离不救我?为什么远离我呻吟的言语?

耶稣基督在十字架上是终极战场上的一个战士。以赛亚书53章说他去面对,他去面对我们的敌人。邪恶和罪和死亡,他被它们压碎了,现在他在呻吟,看,他在呻吟,他在死亡,他呼求,没有人来。

你知道为什么吗?圣经说这是上帝在自己里面吸收人类为我们彼此、对世界、甚至对上帝所做的所有邪恶的刑罚。他在支付我们罪的刑罚,所以现在你可以知道,因为耶稣基督在他的呻吟中被遗弃,你永远不会,因为耶稣基督在他的死亡呻吟中被离弃。

当你呻吟时,父听到它,就像母亲或父亲听到孩子的哭声一样,他爱你,他听到那不清楚的哭声,他取走请求的愚蠢部分并丢弃它,他回答你会要求的,如果你足够聪明知道,他围绕你,他通过苦难使你成为伟大的东西,有一天他将结束它。耶稣基督死在十字架上,所以有一天上帝可以在这个世界上结束邪恶和苦难,而不结束我们。你相信吗?

如果你相信,你可以唱拉尔夫·沃恩·威廉姆斯的这首歌,在他的一首歌中有一句歌词是这样的。当斗争激烈,战争漫长时,远处的凯旋之歌悄悄传入耳中,然后心再次勇敢,手臂强壮。在斗争中,你想想那个未来,那遥远的凯旋之歌,得到视角,通过祷告处理,耶稣基督的模式将在你的生命中重现,这就是你如何能处理它,即使在圣诞节,让我们祷告。

天父,感谢你给我们这套资源,并向我们保证它们会起作用,因为你的儿子在十字架上为我们所做的。感谢你来到世界,让自己沉浸在我们的苦难中,在圣诞节,对于耶稣基督全能的灵魂来说,成为一个无助的婴儿,来到这个世界,一定是一个如此大的震撼。但我们感谢你这样做,在圣诞节,我们从中汲取所有无限的安慰和力量,以面对生活对我们的任何事情,我们感谢你我们可以通过圣灵和通过耶稣做到这一点,奉他的名我们祷告,阿们。
