# Love Your Enemies / Love Your Enemies

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details.

Have you ever wondered what it really means to live a great life? The Bible says the Ten Commandments aren't confining rules, but a framework for building a life of true greatness. Today, Tim Keller takes an in-depth look at one of the Ten Commandments and helps us understand what it means to live the way God designed us to, free, whole, and rooted in His love.

Let's turn to Matthew chapter 5. Jane, thank you. I never had anybody in my church that could sing that before.

That's why I came to New York. Among other things, Matthew chapter 5, and we're going to read from verses 21 to 24, and then we will move down the chapter and read verses 38 through 48. Matthew 5, 21 to 24, 38 to 48.

You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. And again, anyone who says to his brother, Rachah, is answerable to the Sanhedrin, but anyone who says, you fool, will be in danger of the fire of hell.

Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there, remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift. You have heard that it was said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

And if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you. Do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

You have heard that it was said, love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your father in heaven. He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own brothers, what are you doing more than others?

Do not even pagans do that. Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect. This is the word of the Lord.

**The Sixth Commandment and the Radical Ethic of Love:**

We're moving through a series on the Ten Commandments, and we've said each week that the commandments are high steel on which to build a life of greatness. And now we get to the sixth commandment, thou shalt not murder. And in particular, this morning, we're looking at Jesus Christ's exposition or teaching of that commandment.

Now, Jesus' way of expounding the commandments, his way is simple and yet profound. He always points out that if a commandment forbids something, at the same time it enjoins the opposite. That means if on the one hand it says, have no other gods before me, it means I should be the first priority in your life.

Of course, if the negative is there, the positive is implied. And so Jesus Christ at this point is saying, yes, thou shalt not murder means human life must not be destroyed or weakened. And we looked at that last week.

Human life must not be destroyed or weakened. That means the opposite is also being demanded by this commandment, and that is that we must live an ethic of radical love and forgiveness. This is a very famous radical ethic of love.

The most radical ethic that's ever been put forth, turn the other cheek. If someone slaps you on the one cheek, turn to him the other one also. Now this ethic has been roundly criticized and widely is disregarded.

But no one ever says the reason that this ethic is disregarded or the reason I don't like it. No one ever says because it's too low or vile or unworthy. They always say it's too high.

It's too lofty. See the Christian ethic, the Christian understanding of relationships is so lofty. It's unrealistic.

I think what we're going to see here as we look at this passage is that it's not. It's lofty. It's high.

In fact, it is the only hope that the world's got. And I'm not sure anybody could really argue. I think I don't know.

No one in their right mind would want to come up and debate the issue. And that issue would be the issue would be something like this stated that Jesus ethic of turn the other cheek, that radical love ethic is the only hope of mankind. I think I think you'd be crazy to try to get up and debate that.

I think everybody understands that if only people could live like that, just imagine what the world would be like. But the thing we don't understand is that that ethic is part of a package. If you look at this passage, you will see it's part of a package.

The package is Christianity itself is actually an interconnected set of radically altered relationships. Christianity. Yes, it's a religion.

It's a faith. It's many things. But one of the ways to understand it is to think of it as an interconnected set of radically altered relationships.

This passage shows you how they are interconnected. It goes like this. A Christian is someone who's come into a radically new relationship with God.

And because you have come into that new relationship with God, it creates a brand new and unique relationship to yourself. And because you've come into a brand new relationship and attitude toward yourself, it results in a completely unique and different attitude and relationship to the world and the people around you. You see that a new relationship of God creates a new relationship with yourself, creates a new relationship with others.

And it's a package. It comes together. It's very clear that you cannot just pick this thing up out about turning the other cheek and say, wouldn't it be great if everybody could live like that?

Of course, it's unrealistic because it's all of a piece. That's why we see here that God says, if your relationship with your fellow man is out of accord, you shouldn't be worshiping because your relationship with God and your relationship with yourself and your relationship with the world all fit together. And they can't be separated.

They rise and fall together and you can't have one without the others. And that's why Jesus at the end of this passage down in verse 47 says, what do ye more than others? What he's saying here is, if you are a follower of mine, if you have been radically transformed inside in your attitude toward yourself because of your new relationship with God, you have got the ability not just to love the people who love you, but to love your enemies, to turn the other cheek, to live this incredible lifestyle.

He says, what do ye more than others? It's almost a way of saying, you have the ability to go into light speed. You know how Luke Skywalker and Han Solo when they're trying to get away from the bad guys, they would say, got to jump to light speed.

And what it means is not going a little faster, but just zipping into an entirely different realm. And Jesus Christ says, if you understand this package, you will see a reason I can talk about turning the other cheek. The reason it seems so lofty is it's a new dimension.

It's a whole new dimension, but it's based on a radically different relationship change between you and God and you and yourself. It comes together. What is that dimension?

Let's take a look at those three aspects. Christianity is an interconnected set of radically altered relationship. They all come together as a new relationship with God, with yourself and with others.

They all fit together. Now, as we move through the passage, we'll see, first of all, we see what God says a Christian's understanding of him or herself is. Then we'll see the relationship with others.

And finally, we'll see the root of it all, a new relationship with God. We move through the passage. So let's do that.

**A Restructured Attitude Toward Self:**

Number one, first, a follower of Christ has a restructured, unique attitude toward him or herself. Verse 22, it's you have heard it said, do not murder. And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.

But I tell you, anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Anyone who says to his brother, Raka is answerable to the Sanhedrin. And anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell.

Point number one, a lifestyle of love starts on the inside with a heart that doesn't look down on anybody. A lifestyle of love outside, you know, love in your behavior begins with a heart on the inside that cannot look down at anybody. Oh, my friends, do you know what we're about to talk about?

If there's anybody can get away from these verses unbloodied, you are not honest. These verses are like a surgical knife and they will bloody you. The only difference is, are you going to move around on the table so the surgeon can't really go in and do his work?

He might gall you, he might gore you if you do that. Because you can come away just feeling more guilty or let it go, just stay still and let the surgical knife go all the way into your heart. Now look, what Jesus says here, first of all, he says, you've heard it said, thou shalt not murder.

Jesus is not here talking about the Old Testament scripture. Because if he was talking about the scripture, he would have said, it is written. Instead, all along here, he says, you have heard it said, he's talking about what teachers were saying about the law.

And he's pointing out that the teachers say, if you don't murder, that means if you don't physically kill somebody, then you're not subject to the judgment. If you physically kill someone, you are subject to the judgment and that's it. But Jesus is going ahead and saying, no way, you don't understand the import of the law.

The import of thou shalt not murder is this, anyone who is angry with his brother is guilty. Now that word anger that Jesus used, there's a number of words he could have used, but the word he uses there is a word that means to swell up. It means a slow burn.

It means dislike. It means a distaste. You can imagine it starts as dislike, then it becomes distaste, then it becomes resentment, then it becomes bitterness.

It's a slow burn. He's not talking about a temper flare, though that can be wrong too, but he's talking about that slow dislike and burn. Anyone who is angry with his brother is guilty.

Then he goes a little further and says, anyone who says raka, now wait a minute, let me just tell you what you do. This is a real New York sin. The word raka means literally you nobody.

And you know, why would anybody say you nobody? What Jesus is trying to point out is not that anybody actually uses that as a slur or an insult, but what he means is when you treat people as non-persons, when you treat people as inconsequential, in other words, it's the attitude that goes something like this, please roll the eyes, oh brother, I am so much cooler, I am so much more sophisticated, I am so much more cultured, I am so much more mature, I am so much more macho, I am so much more feminine, I am so much more together than you, but I'm not saying that, I'm just missing you. Please, oh brother, you nobody.

And then the last thing he points out is anyone who says you fool, and there the Greek word, it's actually not a Greek word, it's an Aramaic word, which is, Jesus spoke Aramaic, and therefore when they wrote the Bible, they had to take Aramaic words and bring them into Greek, so rakai is an Aramaic word, but then there's a word here, it's a Greek word, moros, from which we get the word moron, and we all know what that means, you moron, he says, you're guilty of hell fire if you call somebody a moron. And what he's trying to get across is that the sin that is so wrong is the sin of scorn. It's the sin of looking down your nose at somebody else and saying you are less important than me.

And Jesus says it all starts there, that's the problem, that's what leads to murder, that's what leads to a lack of love, that's it, scorn. And the reason this is so absolutely critical is we have to recognize that if there is pride, if there is a looking down the nose, that eats up love, because the way the Bible defines love is love is counting your own needs as less important than somebody else's. That's what love is, it's counting someone else's needs and interests as more important than your own needs or interests or comfort.

So it means to see someone else as actually more important than you, at least the needs. It doesn't mean to see a person as more intelligent, it doesn't mean you have to see everybody as more cultured or more sophisticated or more mature as you, because they're not. But what love is, is an act of the will in which you say your needs are more important than mine.

And so if you're looking down your nose at people, if you're looking and scorning people, if you're saying you're not at my level, that eats up your ability to love. That's why you have in 1 Corinthians 13, we're told love, when Paul is defining love, he says love is not proud, because they're mutually exclusive, they can't live together. He also says love isn't courteous.

Now love is courteous, and you see, courtesy comes to the degree that you see somebody as important. That's why you're courteous to the president who walks in. How do you do?

Please sit right here. I'm fine, thank you. Can I get you something?

But a little kid, you know, who's in your way, you're trying to get out the bus, you don't say, excuse me, you know, pardon me, you say, get out of my way, kid, even though you're not saying it out loud, you know. If you're from the Midwest, you're not saying it out loud, but you're saying it in here, right? Courtesy, love, is eaten up when you look down your nose at somebody, and therefore, if you're counting people as less important than you, Jesus says, it just destroys, it destroys the ability to love.

And here we're getting to a very important point. One of the main differences between a Christian, a real Christian, and somebody who's just religious is that a Christian understands the inwardness of sin. See, Jesus is saying something quite critical.

He is saying, look, what is a murderer? What's the difference between a murderer and a grumpy person? What's the difference between a murderer and you?

And the answer is, it's all relative. It's not a qualitative difference, it's a quantitative difference, Jesus says. And anger, slow distaste and dislike for somebody that grows into resentment, that grows into a love and a desire to see somebody else knocked down, finally grows into murder.

But you've got to remember, when you think about an acorn, the whole tree is in the acorn, and the acorn doesn't look like much, does it? Yet the whole tree is in there, plus all the acorns on that tree, and therefore the whole forest is in there. It's hard to believe that the whole forest, all the trees in all the world could have come from one seed, you see, technically.

And the point is, when the seed is laying on your hand, if it doesn't have the proper moisture and the proper soil and the proper conditions, it'll just stay there in a kind of inert form, but it's there. It's all there. And if it's just put in the right situation, in the right location, it's all there.

What is the difference, Jesus says, between you and a murderer? And the answer is, the Christian answer has always been, it's only a quantitative difference. The murderer has been in a condition, in a family situation, living in a particular social situation, where his acorn got watered, where it got planted, and it's the only difference between that person and you.

We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life, good things that can easily become ultimate things. When we put our faith in them, deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings. The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need.

In his book, Counterfeit Gods, The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power, and the Only Hope That Matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals and our own hearts, and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires. This month, we'll send you Counterfeit Gods as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Christ with people all over the world.

**Understanding the Inwardness of Sin:**

And a Christian begins to realize that. A Christian understands the inwardness of sin. A Christian doesn't say, oh, well, you know, I don't disregard the Ten Commandments.

I'm a pretty good person. I don't lie. I don't cheat.

I don't steal. I don't rape. I don't, you know, I don't, I'm a straight arrow.

I haven't killed anybody. But, you know, a non-Christian might look at life like that. A moral person might look at life like that.

But a Christian, if somebody says, man, I see my self-centeredness, I see how self-absorbed I get, and I see how that eats up love, I see it. And when you see it, you have crossed over the line into what every Christian has got to experience in order to really be born again, and that is conviction of sin. You have to say, I am in need.

I am a sinner. And until, listen, friends, until you have gotten that conviction of sin, by the way, if you think that what I'm just telling you right now is just crazy, it's not rejecting my idea. You're rejecting the whole ethic.

Because the whole love ethic is based on this, that you are not qualitatively different than the other people around you, that you might look at somebody who looks far below you economically or far below you educationally or far below you socially or far below you in many other ways, but the difference between you and that other person is extremely marginal. You know, if you're looking through a little microscope and you're looking way down at all these tiny little one-cell animals, here's one cell that's twice as big as another one cell, and they might, you know, the one-cell animal that's twice as big as the other one-cell animal might feel like he's pretty great, and he pushes the rest of them around, but as far as you're concerned, they're all microbes, you know, it's kind of silly for you to think of one as bigger than the other. They're all minuscule in relationship to you.

When God looks at you, he doesn't see a great deal of difference. You know, one microbe is a little bit bigger than another microbe, big deal. We all are so far short of the standards that he gives, and that is love.

Treat people as if they were yourself. Love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself. You're so far from that, and a Christian understands that, and that radically changes the Christian's understanding of him or herself.

So he's no longer looking down at people, and he finds his ability to start to love actually goes up with conviction of sin, not down. There's a wisdom that comes with it. In the beginning, for example, in the beginning of the bulletin, there's an interesting little quote.

G. K. Chesterton, who was a fine Christian, wrote a series of detective novels, and the hero in the detective novels was a priest, a Roman Catholic priest named Father Brown.

In fact, hasn't there been some TV shows based on that recently? And G. K.

Chesterton, at one point, has Father Brown explain. Father Brown is a thoughtful Christian, and at one point, somebody says, Father Brown, how is it possible that you always seem to be able to figure these murders out? How is it possible that you always seem to be able to understand how the murderer thinks?

And Father Brown says, it's all a theological issue. Look, no man's really any good till he knows how bad he is, or might be, see, till he's realized exactly how much right he has to all this snobbery, this sneering, this talking about criminals as if they were apes in a forest 10,000 miles away, till he's squeezed out of his soul the last drop of the oil of the Pharisees, till his only hope is to capture one criminal only in life and to keep him under his own hat. You see, now, listen, Chesterton was Roman Catholic, Chesterton was living in a different age.

I want you to see that what I'm telling you today is not my idea. It's always been the Christian ethic. Unless you come to understand that the seeds of the worst sins live in your own breast, unless that humbles you, unless you begin to see that you're not really intrinsically that much different from the people around you, unless you recognize the fact that, yes, God has come to you and through Christ you've been forgiven, but that doesn't make you that much different than other people, you will never be able to come about and have that radical love ethic.

Until you realize that the same reason that some people have wanted to dominate the world is the same reason that Harry wants to run the accounting department, and it's the same reason that you always like to look your name up in print whenever you can find it. It just looks great to see your name in print. It's the self-centeredness that's there at the bottom.

**Turn the Other Cheek - A Case Study:**

And then Jesus goes on to give us a case test study. He says, here's one of the ways in which you can see how this attitude, this new radically changed attitude toward the self manifests itself. He goes over here to verse 38 and he says, turn the other cheek.

Now look, people really misunderstand this. When he says, when someone slaps you on the cheek, turn him the other one. And a lot of people have said, ah, Jesus is teaching that you should never stop injustice, that no matter what somebody does to you, you should let them walk all over you.

And that's silly, because Jesus doesn't talk like that, Paul doesn't teach that, and you can see it. Remember when Paul, because he was a Roman citizen, he was jailed without a trial and that was illegal, and he called people to account and he lodged a protest and he appealed to Caesar? Do you remember when Jesus was slapped during his trial and that was illegal, he lodged a protest?

Do you realize that Christians are supposed to stand for justice and they're supposed to deal with oppression? Well, then what is he talking about? He is saying, you heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

And Jesus is referring to the fact that in the Old Testament, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was a law for judges. It was a rule of thumb for civil suits. Israel was the most merciful of all the ancient peoples because it limited personal revenge.

You see, in the good old days, if I killed your cow, you'd probably come and, what would you do? You know, when someone does something wrong, you don't say, I'm going to kill your cow. What you do is you go and you say, I'm going to burn your farm down, fella.

And you poked one of my eyes out, I'm going to poke both of your eyes out. The judges of Israel got this extremely merciful rule, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It was called the lex talionis, and it meant we do not have personal vengeance in our society, but instead we make restitution in an orderly way.

And Jesus says, as great as that is, and as important as it is for building a society on that, it is not your law for relationships. And he says, when you are slapped on the cheek, turn the other one. Now, you realize that being slapped on the cheek does not mean somebody is trying to beat you up.

You don't slap somebody on the cheek when you're trying to beat them up. You shoot them, you punch them in the mouth. A slap on the cheek is an insult.

And Jesus is very clearly saying, when someone insults you, there must be no concern on your part to save face. There must be no more concern to deal with your honor or your dignity. You see, when Jesus lodges his protest, or when Paul lodges his protest, they don't say, they say this.

They say, you've done wrong, and I respectfully suggest that you look at the law books and that we work on this because justice must be done. Instead of that, you know, people like to do this. They like to say, do you know who you are?

Do you know who I am? How dare you do that? I'm going to sue you for everything it's worth, and what you're doing is, I'm going to save face, I'm going to deal with my honor.

And a Christian is somebody who's got an attitude toward the self that does not worry about that. You seek justice, yes, but you forgive. In fact, that also comes up here in verse 40.

If somebody wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. That does not mean, when somebody's robbing you of one wallet, say, you missed this one. What it does mean is this, it's the same thing as turning the other cheek.

Why you turn the other cheek? Why you give him your tunic, you go the second mile, is you never close the door on the relationship. You always say, I'm going to give you a chance to do it right.

When somebody wrongs you, there's a Christian approach to it and a non-Christian approach. The non-Christian approach is, never again will I give you even a chance to do that because of what you did to me. You dishonored me, that galls me, and I cut you off.

Even though I'm not going to come after you and try to beat you up, I want nothing more to do with you. The relationship is over, forget it. A Christian goes about it like this, say, listen, what you did was wrong, and I really want justice, but it's not because that I need somehow, in any way, to reinstate my great honor.

I also want you to know this, I am not going to let you continue to sin against me because that wouldn't help you, but anytime you want to be friends, I'm ready. Anytime you want to get back in a decent relationship, I'm ready because, you see, I want you to be able to do it right. And the answer to the question, what does it mean to turn the other cheek, means not to worry about an insult and to always say, listen, you slapped me on this cheek, but anytime you want to come back and kiss this one, I'm ready.

Anytime you want to get the relationship back on the right level and on the right footing, I'm ready. A Christian has that attitude toward the self, and that's the reason why the Christian can even act like that. **A Radically Reoriented Relationship to Others:**

And that leads to that relationship, we're already into the other point, the relationship of the radically reoriented relationship to other people.

It says in verse 44, love your enemies. Now look, some people say, this is incredibly impractical. Do you realize that if you just love people like this and forgive them constantly, they're going to walk all over you?

Number one, I said, a Christian doesn't let them walk all over you. But number two, when somebody says it's impractical to keep your heart open to people, to keep forgiving people, I say, if you're a Christian, number one, you will forgive because you will say in your heart, wait a minute, I was an enemy too. I did things wrong.

And if I decide I'm going to hold this grudge against this person, how in the world am I going to expect God to forgive me? If I won't forgive this person these three sins against me, how in the world do I expect God to forgive me my three billion sins against him? A Christian says, why do I think of myself as so important?

I'm a sinner saved by grace. And that takes away the need for vengeance. It takes away the need for honor.

And if anybody says it's really impractical to keep opening your heart to people, I'll tell you what's impractical. It's impractical to do what many of you are doing, and that is spending all of your life pulling yourself into a tighter and tighter and tighter circle so you won't be hurt, and so nobody can wrong you, and so you'll never be vulnerable again. And you see what happens when you really make sure that you don't forgive people and you don't turn the other cheek?

Listen to this. Here's a great quote. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken.

If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one. Wrap it carefully around with your hobbies, your avocations, your luxuries, and your leisure pursuits. Avoid all real entanglements.

Lock it up and safe, have it be safe in the casket of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe and dark, your heart will change. Oh yes, it will not be broken.

It will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The only alternative to the risk of tragedy is damnation. What's practical?

You tell me. Is it impractical to turn the other cheek? My friends, it's impractical not to because of what it does to you.

And the only way you can ever have the power to turn the other cheek is if you have this radically new attitude toward yourself that enables you to love other people and give of yourself to other people. It creates a servant heart only if you realize that you were an enemy and that though God could have punished you and should have punished you, he sent Jesus Christ to take your punishment on. That and only that gives you that radically new self-image that changes your attitude toward people.

And only that. **The Story of the Tsar:**

Let me conclude with this interesting story. True story.

Years ago, the Tsar of Russia, I'm not sure it was the last Tsar, I think it was the second last Tsar, I'm not sure which one. One of the Tsars of Russia, the emperors of Russia, had a friend, a dear friend who died and the friend gave him his son to keep and to raise. The Tsar raised this young man and educated him and clothed him in everything.

And this young man went into the army. There he became the accountant of a pretty large part of the army and because he began to get into gambling, he began to embezzle funds to make good his debts. And one night he was sitting and looking at the books and he realized that the jig was up.

It wasn't going to be long before they were going to put him in jail and he was going to be in jail for the rest of his life. And he realized that the jig was up. It wasn't going to be long before they were going to find him.

And he sat there with a gun and he said, best thing to do would be to kill myself because I won't be able to stand the dishonor of it. But he was drinking heavily in order to get the nerve up to kill himself, but what happened was he drank so heavily he passed out before he could. Now the czar was the kind of man who liked to go spy on people as czars are wont to do.

And he used to get in his corporal's outfit, he used to dress up in a corporal's uniform and go about his army and just hear what people were saying and find out what things were doing and find out what the morale was of the rest of the troop. He came into the room where this young man had passed out over the books. He looked at the books and he began to realize what had happened.

So he wrote a note. He added up how much the debt was, he added up what was going to happen and he wrote up a note and said, I will make good this amount of the debt. And he wrote the entire debt out and he signed it, the czar, and he took his signet ring and he stamped it.

And he left. Young man woke up later on out of his drunken stupor and found the note and he couldn't believe it. And he says, wait a minute, the czar has been here and he's seen everything and he still loves me.

And not only that, he accepts me. Not only that, he put his seal to my cause and my need. Now friends, the gospel is very simply the same thing.

Jesus Christ came to earth incognito as a man. He's come in and he's looked into your heart and he's not only seen a lot of things that no, there's things in your heart that you wouldn't want anybody else in this room to ever know. But the scary thing is he saw a thousand things worse than that, worse than you've ever seen.

And he still loves you and he gave himself for you. And if you receive him as savior, all of those things can be wiped away. Does that move you?

If that moves you, then you will be enabled to turn the other cheek. If that doesn't move you, if you reject it, you're stuck. What do ye more than others?

There's a light speed in relationships that's available to us all. What do ye more than others? Let's pray.

**引言：** 欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为《生命中的福音》的月度伙伴。如果你想了解更多信息，请在今天的播客结束时继续收听。你是否曾经想过，真正伟大的人生意味着什么？

圣经告诉我们，十诫并不是限制性的规条，而是建立真正伟大人生的框架。今天，蒂姆·凯勒将深入探索十诫中的一条，帮助我们理解如何按照神的设计生活，自由、完整，并植根于祂的爱中。让我们翻到《马太福音》第五章。珍，谢谢你。

我从未在我的教会中有过能这样歌唱的人，这就是我为什么来到纽约。这次我们来看《马太福音》第五章，我们将阅读第21到24节，然后再阅读第38到48节。《马太福音》5章21到24节，38到48节。你们听过对古人的教导，不可杀人，杀人的必受审判。

但我告诉你们，凡向弟兄动怒的，必难逃审判。还有，凡骂弟兄是拉加的，必交给公会审判，而说“你这个傻瓜”的，必难逃地狱的火。因此，如果你在祭坛上献礼物时，想起有人对你不满，就把礼物留在坛前，先去和兄弟和好，然后再来献礼物。你们听过有教导说，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。

但我告诉你们，不要与恶人对抗。如果有人打你的右脸，把另一边也转给他。如果有人想告你，要拿你的里衣，连外衣也让给他。有人强迫你走一里路，就同他走二里路。

求你的，就给他；向你借贷的，不可回避。你们听过有教导说，要爱邻居，恨仇敌。但我告诉你们，要爱你们的仇敌，为逼迫你们的人祷告，这样你们就可以成为天父的儿子。因为他使太阳照好人也照歹人，降雨给义人也给不义的人。

你们若只爱那些爱你们的人，有什么赏赐呢？税吏不也是这样行吗？你们若只问候弟兄，所做的与别人有什么不同呢？外邦人不也是这样行吗？

所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。这是主的话。**第六诫与激进的爱的伦理：** 我们正在讲述关于十诫的系列讲道，并且每周都说，诫命是建立伟大人生的钢筋。而现在我们来到第六诫：不可杀人。

今早我们特别关注耶稣基督对这条诫命的解释。耶稣解释诫命的方式简单而深刻。他总是指出，如果一条诫命禁止某件事，它同时也倡导相反的事。**这意味着如果诫命说“在我面前不可有别的神”，那意思就是我应当是你生命中的首要优先。**

当然，如果有负面的命令，也就隐含了正面的要求。因此，耶稣基督在此强调，“不可杀人”意味着不应破坏或削弱生命。我们上周谈到了这一点。生命不应被毁坏或削弱。

**这意味着这条诫命同时也要求我们必须实践一种彻底的爱与宽恕的伦理。**这是一个非常著名的、极端的爱伦理：“若有人打你的脸，转另一边给他。”这个伦理常常受到批评，并被广泛忽视。但从没有人因为这个伦理太低或者卑下而不喜欢它，人们总是说它太崇高。

基督教的伦理，对人际关系的理解是如此崇高，以至于不切实际。我认为，当我们仔细看这段经文时，会发现它其实并不不切实际。是的，它很崇高，事实上，它是世界唯一的希望。我不太确定有没有人会想要争论这一点。

我认为没有理智的人会想试图辩论这个问题。那个问题可能会是这样的：耶稣关于“转另一边脸”的伦理，这种激进的爱伦理，是人类唯一的希望。我认为大家都明白，如果人们能那样生活，世界会是什么样。但我们不得不理解的是，这种伦理是一个整体的一部分。

如果你看这段经文，你会发现它是一个整体的一部分。这个整体就是基督教本身，它实际上是一组相互关联的、根本改变的关系。基督教，是的，它是一种宗教，是一种信仰，是很多东西。但其中一种理解方式是将其视为一组相互关联的、根本改变的关系。

这段经文显示了它们是如何关联的。基督徒是与神建立了根本新关系的人。而因为你与神建立了这种新关系，它会创造出一种新的、独特的自我关系。因为你与自我建立了这种新的关系和态度，它会导致一种完全独特和不同的对世界和周围人们的态度和关系。

新的与神关系创造了新的自我关系，从而创造出新的与他人关系。这是一个完整的整体。很明显，你不能只摘出关于“转另一边脸”的内容，说“如果每个人都能这样生活，那该多好”。当然，这不切实际，因为这一切都是一个整体。

这就是为什么我们看到这里神说，如果你与同胞之间的关系不协调，你就不应该敬拜，因为人与神、与自我和与世界的关系都是紧密联系的，不能被分开。它们共同起伏，你不能拥有其中之一而没有其他。这就是为什么耶稣在这段经文的最后，也就是在第47节说，“你们做的比别人有什么不同呢？”他在这里所说的是，如果你是我的追随者，如果你在内心得到了根本的改变，由于你与神的新的关系，你有能力不仅仅是爱那些爱你的人，更能爱你的仇敌，转另一边脸，过上这种令人难以置信的生活方式。

他说，“你们做的比别人有什么不同呢？”这几乎是在说，你有能力进入超高速模式。你知道像路克·天行者和韩·索洛当他们… 当他们试图逃离那些坏人，他们会说，得跳入光速。而**这意味着不仅仅是加快速度，而是进入一个完全不同的境界。**

耶稣基督说，如果你理解这个含义，你就会明白我为何能谈论"转另一边脸"。之所以显得如此崇高，是因为它代表着一个全新的维度，但这个维度是基于你与神以及你自己之间彻底改变的关系。这个维度是什么？让我们来看看这三方面。

基督教是一种互相关联的根本上改变的关系集合。它们共同组成了与神、与自己和与他人的新关系。这些关系都紧密结合在一起。现在，当我们阅读这段经文时，我们会首先看到神对基督徒如何理解自己提出的标准。

接下来，我们将看到与他人的关系。最后，我们将探讨这一切的根源——与神的新关系。我们将通过这段经文逐步了解这一切。首先，跟随基督的人对自己有一个重构、独特的态度。

第22节提到，你们听过有这样的教导：不可杀人。任何杀人的，必受审判。但我告诉你们，凡向弟兄发怒的，将要受审判。凡对弟兄说“拉加”的，要受公会的审判。

凡说“愚昧”的，必有地狱的火危险。**重构对自我的态度：** 第一点，爱的生活方式从一个不轻视任何人的心开始。外在的爱的行为始于内心无法轻视他人的态度。哦，我的朋友们，你们知道我们即将讨论什么吗？

如果有谁能从这些经文中毫发无损地走出来，那你就不诚实。这些经文就像一把外科手术刀，会伤到你。不一样的地方在于，你是否会在手术台上动来动去，使外科医生无法真正进行他的工作？因为如果你这样做，他可能会伤到你或者让你感觉很痛苦。

或者你可以让它顺其自然，静静地让手术刀深入你的心。现在来看，耶稣在这里说，首先，他说，你们听过这样的说法：不可杀人。耶稣并不是在谈论旧约的经文。因为如果他在谈论经文，他会说，“经上记着”。

他一直说的是，“你们听过这些话”。他指的是教师们对律法的讲解。他指出，教师们说，如果不杀人，即没有实际杀死某人，那么就不会受审判。如果实际杀了人，就会受审判，仅此而已。

但耶稣进一步说，不，你们没有理解律法的重要性。不可杀人的重要性在于，凡向弟兄发怒的，都已犯罪。耶稣用的那个“怒”字有很多词可以选择，但他选用的这个词意味着膨胀，意味着慢慢燃烧，意味着不喜欢，意味着反感。你可以想象，它从不喜欢开始，然后变成反感，再变成怨恨，最终成为苦毒。

这是一种慢烧。他不是在谈论脾气大发，虽然这也可能是错误的，但他指的是那种慢慢的厌恶和燃烧。凡对弟兄发怒的，都是有罪的。接着他说，凡说“拉加”的，现在等一下，让我告诉你这是怎么回事。

这在纽约是一个真实的罪孽。拉加这个词字面意思是“无名小卒”。你知道，为什么有人会说无名小卒？耶稣想要指出的不是有人实际上用这个词作为辱骂，而是他指的是当你把别人当作无关紧要得人看待时。

当你把别人当作无关紧要的人时，也就是说，这个态度就像这样，请翻个白眼，哦，兄弟，我比你酷多了，我比你更有教养，我比你更成熟，我比你更男人或者女人，我比你更齐全，但我不说出来，只是无视你。请，哦，兄弟，你无名小卒。最后他说，凡说“愚昧”的，在这里希腊语不是一个希腊词，是一个亚兰文词，因为耶稣讲亚兰文，所以他们在写圣经时，需要把亚兰文转成希腊文，因此拉加是一个亚兰文，而这里有个词是希腊词，moros,我们的“白痴”这个词就是从这里来的，我们都知道它是什么意思，你个白痴，他说如果你称别人为傻瓜，你就犯了地狱之火的大罪。他想要表达的是，最错的是轻视的罪。

是那种从鼻子朝下看别人的罪，认为你比别人重要。耶稣说问题就始于此，这导致了谋杀，导致缺乏爱。轻视。这一点至关重要，因为我们必须认识到，如果有骄傲，有那种鼻子朝下看人的态度，那将吞噬爱，因为圣经如何定义爱是：爱是认为你自己的需要不如别人的重要。

这就是爱，爱是把别人的需求和利益看作比自己的需要或利益或舒适更重要。所以，看到别人的需要比你更重要，至少需要上。并不意味着必须认为一个人更聪明，也不意味着你必须认为每个人比你更有教养或更成熟，因为并不是这样。但爱是一种意志的行动，你说你的需求比我的更重要。

所以如果你轻视别人，如果你看不起别人，如果你说你不在我这个水平，这将会影响你爱人的能力。这就是为什么在哥林多前书13章中，说爱是不骄傲的，因为它们是相互排斥的，无法共存。保罗还说爱是不粗鲁的。现在爱是有礼貌的，你看，礼貌源于你认为他人重要的程度。

这就是为什么当总统走进来时你很有礼貌：“你好，请坐在这里。我很好，谢谢，你需要点什么？”但对于挡在你面前的小孩，当你试图赶公共汽车时，你不会说：“请让一让，抱歉。”而是心里想着：“让开，孩子，”即便没有说出口。

礼貌与爱，在你轻视别人时被侵蚀。因此，如果你认为别人不如你重要，耶稣说， 这会摧毁你的爱的能力。这里**我们需要谈一个非常重要的问题。****真正的基督徒和只是**宗教人士之间最大的区别之一，就是基督徒理解罪的内在性。

你看，耶稣在这里提出了一个非常重要的观点。他在说，什么是凶手？凶手和一个性情乖戾的人有什么区别？凶手和你的区别是什么？

答案是：这是相对的，不是质的不同，而是量的不同，耶稣这样说。愤怒，小小的厌恶和不喜欢，会逐渐发展成怨恨，最后变成希望看到别人被打倒的愿望，最终发展成谋杀。你要记住，当你想到橡子的时候，整个树就在橡子里，橡子看起来没什么特别，对吗？然而整个树都在里面，还有那棵树上的所有橡子，因此整片森林都在里面。

很难相信整个森林，世界上所有的树都可能从一个种子而来，对吧，技术上来说。而关键在于，当种子在你手上时，如果没有合适的水分、土壤和条件，它就只是以一种惰性的形式存在，但它在那里，完全在那里。而如果种子被放在正确的环境中，正确的位置里，那一切都会在那里。耶稣问，凶手和你的区别是什么？

基督教的答案一直是：这仅仅是一个量的差别。凶手所处的是一种在特定家庭或社会环境中，那里的橡子得到了浇灌和种植，而这就是那个人和你的唯一区别。我们都在追求成功、真爱或完美生活这些事情，这些本是好事，却容易被我们当作终极追求。当我们把信仰寄托在这些东西上时，我们内心深知，它们无法满足我们内心最深的渴望。

事实上，我们把好的事物当成小神，这些不能给予我们真正需要的东西。在蒂姆·凯勒的书《假神：金钱、性和权力的空洞承诺》中，他向我们展示了圣经的正确理解如何揭示社会理想和我们内心的真相，并显示只有一位神能够完全满足我们的愿望。这个月，我们将把这本书作为我们对您帮助《福音与生命》向全世界传播基督之爱的感谢。您可以在gospelandlife.com/give请求您的副本。

好了，以下是凯勒博士今天讲道的剩余部分。**理解罪的内在性：** 一个基督徒开始认识到这些。基督徒理解罪的内在性。基督徒不会说：“哦，我不违反十诫，我是个相当好的人。

我不撒谎、不作弊、不偷窃、不强奸，我是一个正直的人，没有杀过人。”但一个非基督徒可能会这样看待生活，一个道德的人可能会这样看待生活，但基督徒会说：“我看到了我的自私，我看到我如何被自我吸引，我看到这些如何消耗我的爱，我看到了。”当你看到这些时，你就越过了所有基督徒必须经历的界限，为了真正重生，那就是对罪的认罪。你必须说：“我有需要。

我是一个罪人。”朋友们，记住，直到你有了罪的认罪，顺便说一句，如果你认为我现在告诉你的只是疯言疯语，这不是拒绝我的想法，而是拒绝整个伦理。因为整个爱的伦理是建立在这个基础上的，你不是与周围其他人有质的不同，你可能看到某些人在经济上、教育上或其他许多方面都远不如你，但你和那个人之间的区别是非常微小的。知道吗，如果你用显微镜看下去，看到所有这些微小的单细胞动物，其中一个比另一个大两倍，那个大两倍的单细胞动物可能觉得自己很了不起，并推动其他动物，但对你来说，它们都是微生物，你知道，认为一个比另一个大是有点可笑的。

在神看来，你们之间没有太大区别。一个微生物比另一个大一点，那又如何？我们都远远达不到他给的标准，那就是爱。把别人当成你自己一样对待，全心全意地爱神，并像爱自己一样爱邻居。

你离这些要求太远了，而基督徒理解这一点，而这一点彻底改变了基督徒对自己的理解。所以他不再俯视别人，而是发现他的爱的能力随着对罪的认罪上升了，而不是下降。这带来了智慧。比如，在手册的开头有一个有趣的小引言。

G.K.切斯特顿是一位优秀的基督徒，写了一系列侦探小说，小说中的英雄是一位名叫布朗神父的天主教牧师。事实上，最近不是有一些以此为基础的电视剧吗？在某个时候，布朗神父解释道。布朗神父是一位很有思想的基督徒，而且在某个时候，有人问：“布朗神父，你怎么总能解决这些谋杀案呢？

你怎么总能理解凶手在想什么呢？”布朗神父回答：“这一切都是神学问题。人只有在知道自己有多坏时，才会变得真正优秀。”直到他意识到自己有多少权利来对别人指手画脚，像在谈论森林里相隔一万里的猴子一样谈论罪犯，直到他把法利赛人的油榨出自己的灵魂为止，直到他唯一的希望是在生活中捕获一个罪犯，并把他藏在自己的帽子下。

这一切都不是我的想法，一直以来都是基督教的伦理。除非你认识到最坏的罪恶的种子就在你心中潜伏，除非这让你谦卑，除非你开始看到你和周围的人本质上没有太大区别，除非你承认是的，神已经来到你面前并通过基督赦免了你，但这并没有让你与其他人有多大不同。你永远无法达到那种激进的爱之伦理，直到你意识到，一些人想要统治世界的原因，和Harry想管理会计部门的原因，以及你总是喜欢看到自己的名字被印出来的原因是一样的。看到自己的名字印刷出来就是一种自我中心的表现。

**转另一边脸——案例研究：** 在这里，耶稣给了我们一个案例研究。他说，你可以看到这种态度，这种对自我的全新改变态度是如何表现出来的。他在这里提到38节，说“转另一边脸”。现在，看，很多人对此有误解。

当他说，当有人打你的脸时，转过另一边脸。许多人说，啊，耶稣教导我们不应阻止不公义，不管别人对你做了什么，你都应该让他们随意践踏你。这是荒谬的，因为耶稣不是这样说话的，保罗也没有这样教导，你可以看到。当保罗因为他是罗马公民，却被未经审判就下监，那是非法的，他要求人们为此负责，并向凯撒上诉？

你记得耶稣在受审时被打，那是非法的，他也提出了抗议吗？你知道基督徒应该为正义而站立，并对抗压迫吗？那么，他在说什么呢？他说，你们听过这样的说法，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。

耶稣指的是旧约中的原则，以眼还眼，以牙还牙是针对法官的法律。这是民事诉讼的通则。以色列是所有古老民族中最仁慈的，因为它限制了个人的报复。回到过去的好日子，如果我杀了你的牛，你可能会做什么？

当有人做错事时，你不会说，我要杀掉你的牛。你会说，我要烧掉你的农场，伙计。你戳瞎了我的一只眼睛，我要戳瞎你两只眼睛。以色列的法官们得到了这条极其仁慈的法规，以眼还眼，以牙还牙。

它被称为“同态复仇法”，意思是我们在社会中没有个人复仇，而是采取有秩序的赔偿。耶稣说，尽管这很好，并对建立社会极其重要，但这不是你的人际关系的法律。他说，当你被打在面颊时，要转过其他一边脸。现在，你知道被打在脸上并不意味着有人在试图打你。

你不会在试图打人时打他的脸。那是一种侮辱。耶稣很清楚地说，当有人侮辱你时，你不必关心面子。你不必再关心解决你的荣誉或尊严。

你看，当耶稣提出抗议，或保罗提出抗议时，他们不是说：“你知道你是谁吗？你知道我是谁吗？你怎么敢这样做？我要告你，让你倾家荡产。

”而是说：“你做了错事，我建议你看看法律书籍，我们一起解决这个问题，因为正义必须得到维护。”取而代之的是，一些人更喜欢这样说：“你知道你是谁吗？你知道我是谁吗？我要告你，让你倾家荡产。

”而基督徒对自我的态度是不关心这些的。你寻求正义，是的，但你也原谅。事实上，这在40节中也出现了：如果有人想要控告你，要你的里衣，把外衣也让给他。这并不是说当有人抢你的钱包时，你说“你还漏了这个。

”它的意思是，这和转另一边脸是一样的。为什么你要转另一边脸？为什么你要给他你的里衣，走第二里路，是因为你永远不要关闭关系的大门。你总是说，我要给你一个机会去做对的事情。

当有人对你做错事时，有一个基督徒的处理方式和一个非基督徒的处理方式。非基督徒的处理方式是：“再也不会给你机会做这种事情，因为你对我做了那样的事。你羞辱了我，我怒火中烧，我和你断绝关系。”即使我不想和你打架，我也不想和你再有任何关系。

关系结束了，算了吧。而基督徒是这样处理的：“听着，你做的事情是错误的，我真的想要正义，但这不是因为我需要恢复我伟大的荣誉。我也想让你知道，我不会让你继续对我犯罪，因为这对你没有好处，但无论何时你想再次成为朋友，我已经准备好了。无论何时你想重新建立一个体面的关系，我已经准备好了，因为，我希望你能够做对的事情。

”回答那个问题，转另一边脸是什么意思？是指不需要在意侮辱，总是说：“听着，你打了我这边脸，但无论什么时候你想回来亲这边脸，我都准备好了。无论什么时候你想让关系回到正轨，我都准备好了。”基督徒对自我的这种态度，是为什么基督徒可以有这样的行为。

**与他人彻底重定向的关系：** 这也引导我们进入另一个观点，与他人的这种极端重定向的关系。在第44节中说，要爱你的敌人。现在看，有些人说，这真的不现实。你是否意识到，如果你这样爱人并不断原谅他们，他们会肆无忌惮地践踏你？

第一，我说基督徒不会让他们任意践踏你。但第二，当有人说继续向人敞开心扉，不停原谅别人是不现实的，我会说，如果你是基督徒，第一，你会原谅，因为你会在心中说，“等等，我也是个敌人。我也做错了事情。如果我决定要对这个人怀恨在心，我怎么可能期待上帝原谅我呢？

如果我不原谅这个人对我的三次冒犯，我怎么能期望上帝原谅我对他的三十亿次冒犯呢？”基督徒会说：“为什么我认为自己如此重要？我不过是个蒙恩的罪人。”这样就消除了报复的需求，消除了崇尚荣誉的需求。

如果有人说继续对人敞开心扉是不可行的，我会告诉你什么是不可行的。许多人所做的是整个生活都把自己圈得越来越紧，越来越紧，以免受伤害，以免有人冒犯你，以致你永远不会脆弱。再看看。当你决意不去原谅，决意不转过另一边脸时，会发生什么？

听听这段精彩的引述：爱任何东西，你的心都会被扭曲，甚至可能破碎。如果你想确保它完好无损，就必须不把心交给任何人。把它小心包裹在你的爱好、嗜好、奢侈品和休闲活动中，避免所有真正的牵连。把它锁在安全的自私棺木中。

但在那安全而黑暗的棺木中，你的心会改变。噢，是的，它不会破碎。它将变得牢不可破、不可穿透、不可救赎。避免悲剧唯一的选择是毁灭。

什么是实际的？你告诉我。转过另一边脸是不实际的吗？朋友们，因为它对你的影响，所以不去这么做才是不实际的。

而唯一能让你有力量转过另一边脸的方法是让你对自己的看法有一个颠覆性的改变，这能让你去爱他人并付出自己。只有当你意识到你曾是一个敌人，而神本可以惩罚你，也应该惩罚你，他却差遣耶稣基督代替你受罚时，才会创造出一个仆人的心态。只有这样的意识才能给你带来全新的自我形象，改变你对他人的态度。只有这样。

**沙皇的故事：** 让我以一个有趣的真实故事来结束。多年以前，俄罗斯的一位沙皇，（不确定是最后一位沙皇，应该是倒数第二位，不太确定是哪一位）。其中一位俄罗斯沙皇，一位皇帝，他有一个朋友，一个亲近的朋友去世了，这位朋友将他的儿子托付给沙皇抚养。沙皇抚养并教育这个年轻人，为他提供衣食。

他参军了，并在那儿成为了一部分不小的军队的会计。因为开始赌博，他开始挪用资金以偿还债务。有一天晚上，他坐在书桌前看账本，意识到一切都要暴露了。他会被送进监狱，不会再有自由。

他坐在那里，想着最好的办法就是自杀，因为他无法忍受这样的耻辱。但他拼命喝酒，以壮胆自杀，结果喝得烂醉如泥，没来得及自杀就昏过去了。沙皇有个习惯，喜欢微服私访，秘密窥探军中的情况，看看士气。他穿着下士的军装来到年轻人所在的房间，看到他倒在账本上，沙皇查看账本，明白了发生的事情。

他写下一张纸条，算好了债务数额，写上“我将偿还这笔债务”，签上“沙皇”，并盖上自己的印章，然后离开。年轻人酒醒后看到了纸条，简直不敢相信。他说，等等，沙皇来过了，他看到了这一切但仍然爱我！不仅如此，他还接受了我，不仅如此，他为我的困境和需要盖上了印章。

朋友们，福音的意思非常简单，耶稣基督以人的身份微服来到世上，他进入你的内心，看见了心中许多你不愿让任何人知道的事情。可怕的是，他见到的东西比你想象中糟糕千百倍，但他仍然爱着你，并为你而舍己。如果你接受他为救主，所有的罪孽都能被清除。这个让你感动吗？

如果感动到你，那么你就能转过另一边脸。如果这无法感动你，你拒绝了它，那你就陷入困境。“你们比别人多做了什么呢？” 在人际关系中，有一种超越性的能力可供我们使用。
