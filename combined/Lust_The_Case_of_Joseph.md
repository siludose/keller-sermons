## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why?

In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves. Let me read to you the teaching, Scripture passage, the passage on which the teaching is based this morning. It's found in your bulletins.

It's Genesis 39 and I'm reading from verses 4 to 21. The story of Joseph, Genesis 39, verses 4 to 21. Joseph found favor in his eyes, that's referring to his master, Padafer, a high official in the Pharaoh's court.

Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Padafer put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned. From the time he put him in charge of his household, of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.

The blessing of the Lord was on everything Padafer had, both in the house and in the field. So he left in Joseph's care everything he had with Joseph in charge. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.

Now Joseph was well-built and handsome. And after a while, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, come to bed with me, but he refused. With me in charge, he told her my master does not concern himself with anything in the house.

Everything he owns, he has entrusted to my care. No one is greater in this house than I am. My master is withheld nothing for me except you because you are his wife.

How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God? And though he spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. One day he went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the household's servants was inside.

She caught him by his cloak and said, come to bed with me, but he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house. When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house, she called her household's servants, look she said to them, this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.

And when he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house. She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home. Then she said to him this story, that Hebrew's slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me, but as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.

And when his master heard the story, his wife told him saying, this is how your slave treated me, he burned with anger. Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison, the Lord was with him.

He showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden. This is God's Word.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。你不需要走得太远，就能看到这个世界和我们自身出了什么问题。但有没有一种答案能触及根本，解释为什么会有这些问题？今天的信息中，提摩太·凯勒通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的处境，揭示了圣经对罪的看法以及它为何是唯一能够面对关于我们自己的真相的答案。

让我来读一下今天的教导，所依据的经文在你的讲道单上。这是创世记39章4至21节的内容。约瑟蒙主人波提乏的恩宠，波提乏是法老王宫里的高位官员。约瑟蒙主人的恩宠，成了他的仆人，波提乏把一切所有的事都交托在他手中。

从波提乏把一切所有的事都交托在他手中开始，主赐福给波提乏家中的事和田间的物。因此，波提乏所拥有的一切，在家中、在田间，主的恩惠都临到他身上，他就没有不缺少什么，只顾得着食物吃的。约瑟生得俊美，又蒙主恩。过了些时候，波提乏的妻子留心看他，对他说：“你来与我睡吧！

”但约瑟拒绝了。他对她说：“看哪，主人没有留下家中所有的事交在我手中，他也没有不关心什么的。家中所有的，都交给我管理。没有人比我更大。

惟有你，因为你是主人的妻子。我怎能作这大恶、干犯神呢？”虽然她常向约瑟说这话，约瑟还是不肯听从她的话和她睡在一起。有一天，他在家里做工，家中人都不在里面。

她抓住他的衣襟，说：“跟我上床吧。”但他把外衣留在她手里就跑了出去。当她看到他留下外衣跑出房子时，便叫来仆人说：“你们看，这个希伯来奴仆被我们带到这里来是想戏弄我们。他进来想和我睡觉，但我尖叫起来。

” 当他听到我的呼救声后，就把外衣丢在我身边就跑了出去。她把他的外衣留到丈夫回家时才拿出来。然后她对丈夫说：“这个希伯来奴仆是你带来的，他来这里是要戏弄我。但当我尖叫求救时，他就留下外衣跑出房子。

” 当她的丈夫听到这个故事后，妻子这样告诉他说：“这就是你的奴仆对我做的。”于是他的主人非常生气，就把约瑟抓起来关进了监狱，那是王宫里囚犯被关押的地方。然而，在约瑟被关在监牢里的时候，耶和华与他同在；主赐福给他，使他在狱卒的眼中蒙恩。这是上帝的话语。

## 性：成败的关键力量 / Sex as a Make-or-Break Force

Well, we've been going through the seven deadly sins and finally we get to one that's interesting.

Joseph's career was going along fairly well. He'd been sold into the servanthood by his brothers, but he had been bought by this high official in the society of Egypt and because he was such an incredibly good manager, he rose soon to be in a sense the COO, the chief operating officer of this huge estate. His career was going very well.

This is a lot like a lot of people in New York that I know. His career was going very well and then sex came and sex will come and it's such a powerful force that how you deal with it can make or break you. Haven't you been reading all the chastened, cautious books and articles coming out about sex in the last actually five, almost 10 years.

A senior editor of the Old Look magazine years ago was a he was really a proponent of what was then called sexual liberation in the late 60s and early 70s. In the 80s he came out with a book called The End of Sex and in it he was so chastened he said in there, I've finally come to see that every game has the rules and sex has rules and that unless you play by the rules you'll find that sex can create a depth of loneliness that nothing else can. Isn't ironic.

Sex creating loneliness. So it's such that you see your things may be going very well but sex will come. Joseph, everything's going fine.

Sex came. He wasn't even looking for it but it came. It came at him.

How you handle it will have a lot to say about how your life goes. Now, what do we learn from this passage about it? At the seven deadly sins, this one is called, we're going to call it lust and I'll get to that word in a second.

But the thing that we learn here is we learn something from what we see Potiphar's wife doing and we learn something from what we see Joseph doing and we learn something from what we see God doing and from Potiphar's wife we learned how to understand lust and from Joseph we understand we learn how to handle lust and from God we learn how to heal lust, how to understand it, how to handle it, how to heal it. Let's look, first of all when we see, you see with Joseph and Potiphar's wife we actually have two different cases. I call it the case of Joseph.

Well, but in a sense there's two cases here. Two cases of how sex sexuality lust is treated and so we have a good and a bad example. And with Potiphar's wife, when we see how things operate, we learn something about how we learn to understand what lust is.

Now, some people are going to be kind of unhappy about me using the word lust. When Jimmy Carter talked about lust, poor Jimmy Carter. He said something.

I didn't confess that sometimes he'd look at a woman with lust in his heart and I can still remember Dan Ackroy took three months of jokes at Jimmy Carter's expense on Saturday Night Live making fun of that. And some people would say even the word lust harkens back to regressive, repressive Victorian attitudes towards sex and it can. And usually the word lust in the Bible is not used with reference to sex.

But we can't try to be more wise than Jesus. And Jesus himself said, if you look on someone with lust, you've committed adultery in your heart. So let's not be wise than Jesus.

The word lust in the Bible usually is not got anything to do with sex and the word lust means a desire that's out of order. A desire that's out of order. What do we learn then about sexual lust, about sexual desire?

We see, first of all, that Potiphar's wife noticed Joseph. Now, you know, unfortunately, the English word notice is a little too weak here. The fact of the matter is to notice somebody's physically beautiful, that's not lust.

But that's also not what Potiphar's wife did. Literally in Hebrew, it says she lifted up her eyes to him. And it means to contemplate.

She contemplated his beauty. It says literally, he says he was beautiful of form and beautiful of face. He had a great body and a great beautiful face.

And she contemplated that. And then we see that she had spent so much time contemplating she had gone to bed with him so often in her mind that finally, in spite of the dangers and in spite of his refusal, she had to go to bed with him in reality. And so she tried.

But finally we see, when he refused again and again and again, when she realized she could not have him, she turned murderous and tried to kill him. And you say, where is that? Well, what she was accusing him of was a capital offense.

And we'll get to that later.

我们一直在讨论七种致命的罪恶，现在终于到了一个有趣的罪恶——淫乱。约瑟的职业生涯进展得相当顺利。他的兄弟把他卖为奴仆，但他被埃及的一个高级官员买下，并因为管理能力出众，很快就成了这个庞大庄园的首席运营官（COO）。他的职业生涯发展得很好。

这很像我认识的一些在纽约的人。约瑟的职业生涯进展得很顺利，然后淫乱出现了，而淫乱是一个如此强大的力量，你如何处理它可能会决定你的成败。你们不是一直在阅读过去五年甚至接近十年里关于性行为的所有谨慎的书籍和文章吗？几年前，《旧视》杂志的一位资深编辑曾是性解放运动的倡导者，这发生在20世纪60年代末和70年代初。

到了80年代，他出版了一本书叫《性之终结》，书中他忏悔道：“我终于意识到每种游戏都有规则，性也有其规则，除非你遵守这些规则，否则你会发现性可能会带来一种其他任何事情都无法比拟的孤独感。”这真是讽刺。性会带来孤独。所以你看，即使一切似乎都很顺利，但性还是会到来。

约瑟夫，一切都进展得很顺利。性来了。他甚至没有寻找它，但它还是来了，并且直击他的内心。你如何应对它将极大地影响你的生活走向。

那么，我们从这段经文中学到了什么呢？在七宗罪中，我们将称之为淫欲，我一会儿再解释这个词。但这里我们要学习的是，通过观察波提乏的妻子和约瑟夫的行为，以及上帝的行为，我们可以学到很多。从波提乏的妻子那里，我们学会了如何理解淫欲；从约瑟夫那里，我们学到了如何应对淫欲；从上帝那里，我们学到了如何治愈淫欲，即如何理解和处理它，如何治愈它。

让我们首先看看当看到约瑟夫和波提乏的妻子时，实际上我们有两起不同的案例。我称之为约瑟夫的案例。但事实上，这里有两种情况。这两种情况展示了性、性和淫欲的不同处理方式，所以我们有一个好的例子和一个坏的例子。

当我们观察波提乏的妻子的行为时，我们可以学到如何理解淫欲的本质。有些人可能会对使用“淫欲”这个词感到不太高兴。当吉米·卡特谈到淫欲时，可怜的吉米·卡特说了些什么。我没有承认他有时会怀着淫念看女人，而我至今还记得丹·阿克罗伊德在周六夜现场连续三个月拿吉米·卡特开涮。

有人甚至说，“淫念”这个词反映了维多利亚时代对性行为的倒退和压制态度，确实如此。通常圣经中的“淫念”一词并不是指性的。但我们不能比耶稣更聪明。而耶稣自己说过，如果你怀着淫念看人，你的心里就已经犯了奸淫罪。

所以让我们不要比耶稣更聪明。圣经中提到的“淫念”通常与性无关，“淫念”是指一种不合宜的愿望，一种不正当的欲望。那么我们从性欲的角度能学到什么？首先，我们看到约瑟夫被波提乏的妻子注意到了。

不幸的是，英语中的“注意到”这个词用在这里有点弱了。事实上，她注意到他是因为觉得他很美。但她并没有止步于此。希伯来文中说她“举目望着他”，意思是她在打量他的美丽。

她说他身材匀称、容貌俊美，身体和脸庞都很漂亮。她一直在打量着他。然后我们看到，她花了很多时间在心里想着他，以至于最终不顾危险，拒绝了他的多次拒绝后，她还是决定与他发生关系。于是她尝试了。

但最后我们看到，当约瑟夫一次又一次地拒绝她时，当她意识到无法得到他时，她变得凶残起来，试图杀死他。你说，这在哪儿？其实她指控约瑟夫犯下了重罪。我们稍后再讨论这个。

## 理解淫欲：它不是什么 / Understanding Lust: What It Is Not

What do we learn about lust? Okay, first of all, a negative and then the positive.

Negatively, lust is not sexual desire per se. Joseph does not say this is a wicked thing because it's sexual. He doesn't say that.

We'll see what he says in a second. He doesn't say it's a sin because it's sexual. The Bible never anywhere says sexual desire per se is lust.

Sexual desire is wrong in itself. Sexual desire is bad polluting, defiling in itself, not at all. The Bible, as we're going to see, has one of the most glorious views of sex.

In fact, I'll be very happy to say the Bible has the most exalted view of sex of any other holy book or any other religion anywhere in the world. I don't mind taking it on than that. In Genesis 2, God makes male and female.

And when He creates sexuality, we're told He looked at it and right away He says it's good. And He tells them to be fruitful. Okay?

We see in the Old Testament, in fact, we preached on this last year, in Proverbs 5, husbands and wives are commanded to be ravished with each other sexually. In the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 7, the same thing is told to them. Husbands and wives are commanded to have their commanded to consciously cultivate sexual desire for each other.

The song of solemn is a joyous and graphic celebration of sexual love. And traditionally in history, when the seven deadly sins have been looked at, lust is never at the top. It's way down the list.

Let me show you what I mean. Pride, envy, greed, wrath, all of them have always been further up the list. Those things have always been worse since.

Why? Because the moral theologians of the Christian church have always known that pride, greed, to want to hurt somebody, to want to steal from somebody, to want to put yourself in the center and trample on other people. That is not what the heart was built for.

Those are unnatural desires, unnatural. You weren't built to steal, you weren't built to hurt, you weren't built to hate, you weren't built to kill, but you were built for sexual desire. And that's the reason why see sexual lust, as we're going to see what it is, is a natural desire going wrong.

That's the reason why Jesus, do you realize what an affirmation of sexuality it was when Jesus said to the moral and religious leaders of the time, to the religious leaders, be proud, envious, greedy religious leaders, he said to them, the prostitutes and the pimps are closer to the kingdom of heaven than you. That is an affirmation. Sexuality, per se, intense sexual desire per se is not only not wrong, but it's commanded in situations.

So the idea that lust is any kind of sexual passion, that's just not true at all. Well, then what is sexual desire? How does it become lust?

那么我们能从"淫念"中学到什么呢？首先，负面的教训，然后是正面的启示。负面的是，"淫念"并不是单纯的性欲。约瑟夫并没有说这是邪恶的行为因为它涉及性。

他也没有说这本身就是罪行因为他认为它是性的。圣经从未说过纯粹的性欲就是“淫念”。> 性欲本身是错误的。性欲本身就是污染、玷污，没有丝毫的好。

正如我们将要看到的，《圣经》对性有着最崇高的看法。事实上，我很乐意说，《圣经》对性的看法比其他任何神圣书籍或宗教都要崇高。我愿意为此辩护。在《创世记》2章中，上帝创造了男性和女性。

当祂创造性欲时，我们被告知祂一看就立刻说很好，并且吩咐他们要繁衍后代。明白了吗？我们在旧约中可以看到，在去年的讲道中我们已经谈到了，《箴言》5章命令夫妻之间要有彼此间的性爱。在新约《哥林多前书》7章中，同样的教导也适用于夫妻双方，丈夫和妻子被命令要主动培养对对方的性欲。

《雅歌》是一首欢乐而生动地庆祝性爱之爱的诗歌。历史上，当人们审视七宗罪时，纵欲从来都不是最严重的罪行，它总是排名靠后。让我向你们展示我的意思。傲慢、嫉妒、贪婪、愤怒等罪行一直以来都排在前列。

这些罪行自古以来被认为是更糟糕的事情。为什么？因为基督教神学的道德学家们一直都知道，骄傲、贪婪、想要伤害别人、想要从别人那里偷东西、想要把自己放在中心而践踏他人，并不是人心所为。这些都是不自然的欲望，是不自然的。

你并不是为了偷窃而生，也不是为了伤害而生，更不是为了仇恨和杀人而生，而是为了性欲而生。这就是为什么我们会看到，当我们探讨纵欲时，它是一种自然欲望出了问题的原因。这就是为什么耶稣说，当祂对当时的道德和宗教领袖们，那些自以为是的宗教领袖们说：“你们这些淫妇和娼妓倒比你们圣洁。”这是对性的一种肯定。

性本身，强烈的性欲本身，并不是错的，相反，在某些情况下，它是被命令的。所以，认为欲望就是某种性激情的想法根本就不存在。那么，什么是性欲？它又是如何变成欲望的呢？

## 淫欲是失控的渴望 / Lust as Desire Out of Control

And I'm going to say, from the passage we see lust is three things, three ways to understand it. First of all, lust is desiring out of control. I'll be real brief on that.

Look at what the poor lady, once she's in the grip of her sexual passion, even though he's given her a very firm know. And not only that, even though what she's trying to do is very dangerous to her personally, she can't stop. After day in, day out.

Now people will tell us that sex is just an appetite. And so like any other appetite, and when you get hungry, you should eat, and when you feel sexy, you should have sex. And it's just an appetite and it's fine, and nobody should think there's anything wrong with their appetites.

Really? Really? There's no other appetite that I know that gets as obsessive as this so quickly.

And of course, there's that writer who pointed this out, if you ever found a country where when young guys go off to college, they put these posters up of hamburgers and hot dogs all over their wall, and everybody, they all went running from room to room to look at them. And if you found a country where people paid money to watch someone slowly uncover cakes and pies, you would assume that that country was filled with starving people, and then you would be astonished to say, not only aren't they starving, but the more they eat, the more they do this. That's an appetite out of order.

There's something wrong. It's not just an appetite. You can't trust an appetite like that.

So first of all, lust is desiring out of control. It's out of control. Secondly though, and more importantly, lust is desiring pleasure without a promise.

---

从这段经文我们可以看出，欲望有三种表现形式。首先，欲望是失控的渴望。我将简要说明这一点。看看这位可怜的女人，在她的性激情中无法自拔时，尽管她得到了非常坚定的警告，而且不仅如此，即使她所做的事情对她个人来说非常危险，她也无法停止。

日复一日，年复一年。人们会告诉我们，性就像一种食欲一样。所以当你饿了就应该吃饭，当你觉得性感的时候就应该发生关系。这只是一个食欲而已，并且是正常的，没有人应该认为他们的食欲有什么不对的地方。

真的吗？真的吗？我所知道的没有哪一种食欲能像这种欲望那样迅速变得如此痴迷。当然，那位作家也指出了这一点：如果你发现一个国家，在年轻人去上大学时，他们把汉堡包和热狗的海报贴满了整个房间，每个人都跑来跑去想看这些海报。

如果你还发现一个国家的人们付钱去看某人慢慢地揭开蛋糕和馅饼，你就会认为这个国家里的人是饿坏了的，并且你会惊讶地发现，不仅他们没有饿坏，反而吃得越多，这种行为就越频繁。这显然是一种失调的食欲。有什么不对劲的地方。这不是单纯的食欲。

你不能信任这样的食欲。首先，欲望是失去控制的渴望。它就是失控了。其次，更重要的是，欲望是没有承诺的情况下追求快乐。

## 淫欲是无承诺的欢愉 / Lust as Pleasure Without a Promise

Lust is desiring pleasure without a promise. It's not just desiring pleasure. We said, that's fine.

First of all, it's desiring out of order, and then secondly, it's desiring pleasure out of control. Secondly, desiring pleasure without a promise. Now, what does Joseph say to her is wrong about this?

You are his wife. And if we only saw this passage and we knew nothing else about the Bible, if we knew no other parts of the Bible said anything about sex or adultery or anything else, we might assume that what he was saying was the real problem was only that she was married to him. And if she wasn't married and he wasn't married, it'd be all right.

But we know from the Old New Testament that that's not what he was thinking, only. He was actually saying, when he said, you are not his wife, you are his wife, he was also saying, you're not mine. That's the problem.

See, that's it. One's implied in the other. The Old Testament and the New Testament are crystal clear about this.

Sex is designed only in all ways between one man and one woman in a complete exclusive and permanent commitment called marriage. It's only in all ways between one man, one woman in a complete exclusive and permanent commitment called marriage. It doesn't matter if one person happens to be married to somebody else.

If they're not married to each other, see, that's what Joseph is saying. Joseph is not just simply saying the fact that she's married means because you're married to him that that makes this thing wicked. What makes it wicked is not that it's sexual, but that we're not married.

You're not my wife. Now, why would the Bible say such a thing? And here's the reason why.

You might believe that there's no purpose for sex. Sex is just something that happened. Sex is an accident.

It's an accident of evolution. You're an accident. We're all accidents.

There's no rhyme or reason. Nope. Your reason, your perception, your memory, your creativity, your sexuality, all the things about you made believe that these things are accidents.

And so they were not designed by anyone for a purpose. Now, if you believe that, of course, you're not going to like what I'm about to say, but you also have a lot more troubles, a whole lot more troubles. I mean, you might have a license for sexual freedom, but there's no meaning in your life.

You have no right to call anything right or wrong. You know, we have other problems, far more problems. I mean, if you decide, I want a meaningless existence so that I can have sex, you've bitten off a lot more than you can chew.

The Bible says the reason that sex is only for marriage is because sex was designed for two purposes. Sex is a tell us. Sex is tell us.

Sex has a design, a purpose, a goal, two, two purposes. And when Joseph says we're not married, he's thinking of the first of the goal. Say the two goals of sex.

One is the penultimate goal and one is the ultimate goal. And what Joseph is bringing out right here when he says we're not married, he's bringing out the penultimate goal of sex. God intended sex, he invented sex, as both a sign of and a means of achieving complete life unity between two people.

God created sex to be a way of not only to be a sign. In other words, a means of expressing and a means of achieving and renewing complete life unity between two people. This should be common sense but sin blinds us to it.

Here's what I mean. The physical union should be a sign of union in every other realm. I mean, that's absolute logic.

That's common sense. That's spiritual. It makes sense.

It's beautiful. The Bible says you must not act out something physically, which is not also true, spiritually, personally, socially, legally, every other way. When Paul, you want to understand the Biblical sex ethic, you have to see Paul saying in 1 Corinthians 6, he says, don't sleep with a prostitute.

He says, don't you know that whoever you sleep with, you become one with. Now, do you understand the logic there? Here's what he's saying.

It makes perfect sense. In order to be physically one with somebody, in order to have sex with somebody, you've got to be naked. And to be naked means you get so vulnerable.

Not only do people see you, the other person sees you as you are, but more than that, there is no less defensive physical posture than sexual postures. When you're having sex, you are utterly vulnerable. You have no weapons.

This is the reason why sexual violence is considered by everybody, intuitively, a moral evil, a moral outrage, because when you're having sex, you are absolutely vulnerable. You could be utterly attacked, especially by the person you're having sex with, but you're totally attacked. You're completely vulnerable because you're one.

To become one, you lose your physical independence. You're not able to suddenly make moves. You're not able to act independently.

You see? Not a good time to have a battle. Not a good time to defend yourself.

Well, the Bible says, Paul says, the Bible says, think what happens physically should be also happening in every other realm. The Bible says, the sex is God's designed way to say to somebody else. I belong completely, exclusively, and permanently to you.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way?

And what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World, is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now if you say that and then say I don't want to marry you, you're talking to two sides of your mouth.

You can't be completely exclusively and permanently committed to somebody unless you're married. When you're physically one, you become vulnerable. But when a person says I want to have sex with you, but I do not want to be married to you what they're saying is I don't want to be so bound up emotionally.

I don't want to be so bound up legally. I don't want to be so bound up socially. I don't want to be so bound up with you that I can't make my own decisions.

I want to be vulnerable to you physically but not spiritually. Here's what you're saying. I want your body but not you.

I want to give you my body but I don't want to give you me. You talk about unnatural. The Christian sex ethic is utterly natural.

It holds body and soul together and any other ethic destroys them. It pulls them apart. C.

S. Lewis was amazing when he said to have sex without being married, to want pleasure without a promise, to want pleasure without a commitment is like trying to taste and eat food and then vomit it up. Let me tell you how profound that illustration is even though it's a daring one.

He says a person who wants to taste food but you don't want it to become part of you, you don't want the commitment that's entailed with eating. You don't want the consequences of eating. You don't want the ramifications.

You want all the pleasure but you don't want any of the responsibility. You don't want to become part of you. We know what happens if you try to do that.

It's called bulimia and it ravages you physically. It's utterly unnatural to separate tasting from digestion. And Lewis has the right to go around and say don't you understand, it's just as unnatural to abstract physical union from every other kind.

Just say I want to pleasure without a purpose. It will ravage you spiritually. Sex is a way for you to say to somebody, I belong to you.

It's not only a sign of the fact that you're already totally committed. I belong to you. You belong to me.

You're not your own. I'm not my own. We're one.

That's what marriage is. And if you say I want that physically but I don't want any other way, what God has joined together, let no one put a center. And that is utterly natural.

And you see, therefore, let's see how Joseph handles it. Therefore, lust is not just desiring pleasure out of control. And lust is not just desiring pleasure without a promise.

欲望是没有承诺的情况下追求快乐。不只是追求快乐而已。我们说过，这没有问题。首先，它是无序的渴望；然后，是无法控制地追求快乐。

其次，是追求没有承诺的快乐。现在，约瑟对她说的话中哪里错了？你是他的妻子。如果我们只看这段经文，而对圣经一无所知，如果没有任何其他部分提到性或通奸等话题，我们可能会认为他所说的真正问题只是她嫁给了他。

如果他们都没有结婚，那就没问题了。但我们知道从旧约和新约来看，这并不是他所想的唯一问题。他说“你不是他的妻子”，实际上也是在说“你也不是我的”。这才是问题所在。

你看，这就是关键。一个隐含于另一个之中。旧约和新约对这一点非常明确。性只被设计用来在一个男人和一个女人之间，一种完全、独占且永久的承诺——婚姻中发生。

它只发生在这样的关系中。无论其中一个人是否已经结婚给他人。如果他们没有互相结婚，这就是约瑟的意思。约瑟不只是说她嫁给了他这件事本身是邪恶的。

使这件事邪恶的原因不是因为它涉及性行为，而是因为我们没有结婚。你不是我的妻子。那么，为什么圣经会这么说呢？原因如下： 你可能认为性没有任何目的。

性只是发生的事情。性是一种进化上的偶然事件。它是进化的结果。我们都是偶然出现的。

没有什么规律可循。你的理由、感知、记忆、创造力以及你的一切特质都被认为是偶然的结果。因此，它们并不是为了某个目的而被任何人设计的。如果你相信这一点，当然你不会喜欢我接下来要说的话，但你也面临着更多的麻烦，多得多的麻烦。

我指的是，你可能拥有了性自由的权利，但却没有生活的意义。你没有任何权利去评判任何事对错。我们还有其他问题，更多更严重的问题。如果决定要一个毫无意义的存在以便可以自由行房，那你可真是贪得无厌了。

圣经说，性只在婚姻中存在是因为性被设计有两个目的。性是告诉我们。性是告诉我们。性有其设计、目的和目标，两个目的。

当约瑟说“我们不是结婚的”，他想到的是第一个目标。说出性存在的两个目标。一个是终极目标，另一个是最终目标。而当约瑟在这里说“我们不是结婚的”时，他揭示了性存在的第二个目标。

上帝创造并设计了性，不仅作为一种象征，也是一种实现两个人完全生活统一的方式。上帝创造了性，使之不仅是象征性的表达和实现手段，也是为了不断增进两人之间的完整生活联系。这应该是常识，但罪恶使我们视而不见。这里的意思是：身体上的结合应该象征其他领域中的结合。

这是绝对的逻辑，合乎常理，也具有精神意义，非常合理且美好。圣经说，你不能在身体上做某事，如果它不是在灵性、个人、社会和法律等各个方面也是真实的。保罗在哥林多前书6章中解释了圣经中的性伦理：他说不要与妓女同寝。他指出，与其同寝，你就成了她的一个人。

你能理解其中的逻辑吗？他所说的正是这个意思。为了身体上成为某人的一个，为了与某人发生关系，你必须赤裸相见。而赤裸意味着极度脆弱。

不仅别人看到你，他们还会看到真实的你，而且没有比性行为更不设防的身体姿态了。当你在进行性行为时，你是完全脆弱的。你没有任何武器。这就是为什么每个人都直觉地认为性暴力是一种道德邪恶、一种道德怒火的原因，因为在进行性行为时，你是绝对脆弱的。

你可能会被对方彻底攻击，尤其是和你发生关系的人，你会完全受到攻击。因为你是一体的，所以你会失去身体上的独立性。你不能突然做出动作，也不能独自行动。你看？

这不是一个好时机去战斗，也不是一个好时机去自卫。圣经上说，保罗说，圣经上也这样说：在其他方面所发生的身体上的事情也应该如此。圣经上说，性是上帝设计的方式来告诉别人：“我完全、唯一且永久地属于你。” 我们到处都能看到破碎、战争、残忍和痛苦。

我们在周围的世界以及自己的生活中都感受到了这些。这一切是如何发生的？而又能做些什么呢？在他的新书《这个世界出了什么问题》中，本月即将出版，蒂姆·凯勒博士给出了清晰而充满同情心的答案。

从他在复兴堂的一系列讲道中汲取灵感，凯勒博士展示了罪恶的现实如何解释我们周围所看到的一切痛苦，并且只有福音能提供持久的自由和治愈。无论你是被这个世界的状态压垮了，还是在挣扎着自己的错误或选择，或者只是在寻找希望和喜悦，《这个世界出了什么问题》都将帮助你理解福音如何回应我们世界的伤痛以及我们内心的疼痛。这本新出版的书《这个世界出了什么问题》，是我们感谢您本月捐赠以帮助福音与生命分享耶稣的好消息的心意。今天就请求您的副本吧，访问 gospelandlife.com/give。

那网址是 gospelandlife.com/give。现在，让我们听凯勒博士继续今天的教导。如果你说这些话然后又说我不愿意嫁给你，那你就是在对嘴说话。你不能完全、唯一且永久地对某人作出承诺，除非你们结了婚。

当两个人身体上结合时，他们就变得脆弱了。但当一个人说他想和你发生关系，却不想要婚姻时，实际上他是在表达他不想在情感上被束缚。我不想在情感上被束缚。我不想在法律上被束缚。

我不想在社会上被束缚。我不想因为你而无法做出自己的决定。我只想对你身体上脆弱，而不灵性上。这就是你在说什么：我只要你身体，而不是你这个人。

我想给你我的身体，但不想给你真实的自己。你们谈到不自然，其实基督教的性伦理是极其自然的。它将身体和灵魂紧密结合在一起，任何其他伦理都会把它们分开。C.S. 路易斯曾说过，没有婚姻就发生性行为，没有承诺就追求快乐，这是像尝试品尝食物却不让它成为你的一部分一样荒谬。

他说，你想尝食物但不想承担吃下去的责任，不想面对后果。只想享受所有的快乐而不愿承担责任。不想让你自己的一部分被改变。我们都知道这样做的结果是什么。

那就是暴食症，它会对你身体造成极大的伤害。将品尝和消化分开是极其不自然的。路易斯有权说：你难道不明白吗？将肉体结合与所有其他方面分离同样不自然。

他说：“我只想享受而不承担任何责任。”这会侵蚀你的灵性。性是一种表达“我属于你”的方式。不仅是表明你已经完全投入，我已经属于你。

你也属于我。我们不是自己的主人。你们也不是自己的主人。我们是一体的。

这就是婚姻的意义。如果你说我想在身体上这样，但在其他方面不想这样做，那么上帝所结合的，人不可拆散。这才是极其自然的。因此，让我们看看约瑟是如何处理的。

所以，淫欲不仅仅是无法控制地追求快乐，也不仅仅是不带承诺地追求快乐。

## 淫欲是无视人格的欢愉 / Lust as Pleasure Without a Person

It's actually desiring pleasure without a person. Yes. Lust is the opposite of love.

Love, you want a person. In lust, you just want the pleasure. And the person is a necessary commodity to get there.

In love, you want a person. And if you have to forego pleasure, fine. It's the person that's non-negotiable.

The pleasure that's negotiable. In lust, it's the pleasure that's non-negotiable. And the person that's negotiable, how do you see it?

Look at what happened to her. Look what happened to Potiphar's wife when she realized he had spurned her. She wanted the affirmation.

She wanted the experience. And when she saw she couldn't have him, she turned murderous. And it's not just when you can't get the person that you really see that what you thought was love was really lust because it turns murderous.

Sometimes, even when you get the person, in 2nd Samuel 13, there's an amazing story about David's son, Amon. And Amon slept with his half-sister, Tamar. He got her to bed.

He seduced her. Incessed. We're told that before he seduced her, he was sick with love.

But if you ever read that, it's in 2nd Samuel 13. It's an amazing passage. As soon as he had done consummating sex, it said suddenly, he hated her with a hatred that was greater than the love with which he had loved her.

And he got up and said, arise and go. What had happened? Lust is one pleasure without a person.

Lust is getting incredibly in love with somebody you don't even know. All you see is what you think they can give you. You don't even know them.

You have no idea who they are. In other words, sin takes lust. A good thing, sexual desire, and sin turns sexual desire into lust because it makes sexual desire and end in itself instead of a way of serving somebody.

And through which you can learn the incredible pleasure of giving pleasure. Instead of learning the pleasure of giving pleasure, instead of using sex as a way to serve somebody else, serving somebody you're committed to, somebody you're trying to give pleasure to instead becomes an end in itself and a person just happens to be a necessary commodity. So we can discard the people.

And we do. As time goes on, as long as we have the thing. Now how does Joseph handle it?

实际上，淫欲是不带人的快乐。没错。淫欲与爱恰恰相反。

在爱中，你想要的是人；而在淫欲中，你只想要快乐。而这个人只是达到目的的必需品。在爱中，你想要的是人。如果为了放弃快乐，那也没关系。

人是不可谈判的。快乐是可以谈判的，在淫欲中，快乐却是不可谈判的。而人则是可以谈判的。你怎么看？

看看发生了什么。看看当波提乏的妻子意识到约瑟拒绝她时，她经历了什么。她想要的是肯定；她想要的是体验。当她发现无法拥有他时，她变得凶残起来。

不只是在得不到这个人的时候，你才会发现所谓的爱其实只是淫欲，因为它会变得凶残。有时，即使得到了这个人，在撒母耳记下13章中，有一个关于大卫儿子阿米恩的惊人故事。阿米恩与他的同父异母妹妹塔玛发生了关系。他成功地把她带到了床上，并引诱了她。

在引诱之前，圣经告诉我们他是出于强烈的爱意。但如果你读过那段经文，它就在撒母耳记下13章中，那是一个惊人的段落。一完成性行为后，经文说他突然对她产生了比之前的爱更强烈的仇恨。他说：“起来吧。

”发生了什么？淫欲就是一种没有人的快乐。淫欲是对一个你甚至不认识的人产生极其强烈的爱意。你只看到他们能给你什么，而根本不了解他们是谁。

换句话说，罪将性欲望转变为淫欲，它把原本美好的性欲望变成了一种自我中心的行为，而不是为了服侍他人。通过这种方式，你们可以学习到给予他人快乐的无比喜悦。而不是去学习如何给予他人快乐，不是将性作为一种为别人服务的方式，而是为了取悦你所承诺的人、你试图给予其快乐的人，这种行为本身成了目的，而人只是成为了一种必要的工具。所以我们可以抛弃这些人。

我们就是这样做的。只要还有那东西，时间一长，我们就这样做。现在约瑟是如何处理这种情况的呢？他教会了我们一些非常值得注意的事情。

## 约瑟如何胜过试探：思想与行动 / How Joseph Handled Temptation: Mind and Action

He teaches us something pretty remarkable. As you can see, sin makes sexual desire a very powerful thing. Well, how does he handle it?

He handles it like this. First of all, well, there's two things he does. One is pretty obvious.

One is not so obvious. One is he controls his actions. You notice it says he would refuse to be with her.

You see that? He says not only refuse to go to bed, whether he refused to be with her, he stayed away from her. He stayed away from temptation.

We talked to him about that last week. But the other thing he did, he didn't just control his actions, he controlled his thoughts. James Fix, the guy who wrote the complete book of running, there's a fascinating place in that book in which he says, the hardest thing about running, Amerathons, is your mind.

He found in the early stages of becoming a marathon runner, that what will happen in the midst of the marathon is the fatigue will be so great that your mind will say, why did you ever start this race? What was it that attracted you to distance running? And James Fix said, I would find that I had no answer.

I couldn't remember why I wanted to. He says, one time he dropped right out of a marathon because your brain plays tricks on you, he says, when the heat's on. And the brain will suddenly, he will just decide to forget the reasons that you love running, the great benefits of running in general for you, the great benefits of this race and you just can't even remember it.

So he said, he learned that one of the most important things to do, if you're going to stick with that marathon through the hard time, he says, beforehand, you've got to practically memorize the reasons you love running. Memorize the reasons is an important race. Memorize the reason so you can tell your brain that.

But he says, you know, if things really get bad and you can't remember everything, you know what he says? He says, the final thing I used to trick, I used to play on my brain as I'd say, well, I know when I get there, I'll remember it. I know I had a good reason to start.

And when I get there, I'll remember it. Now there's a lot of wisdom in this and this is what Joseph does. Joseph says, how can I then do this wicked thing and sin against God?

Now there it is. Now, he says two things to himself. First of all, he says, how can I then do this wicked thing?

Now then it refers to the fact that we're not married. And so what he's doing is he's reminding himself of the penultimate purpose of marriage. And the penultimate purpose of marriage is absolute union of body and soul, not pulling them apart, but keeping them together.

And so what does he do? He says to himself, I will not be a monstrosity. I will not ravage myself.

I will not that which God has joined together. I will not put a sunder. But I suppose if Joseph was completely blanking out, here's what you can say, by the way, if you totally blank out, you say, look, no sex outside marriage.

This is the one thing that for 2,000 years, every branch of the Christian Church has agreed on orthodox Catholic and Protestant. Jewish Judaism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, all of these centuries of these great religions who disagree on so many other things they all agree with this. They all believe this.

The only people who don't believe it is something, this is just a belief that just come up very recently and very, very small little bubble pockets of people, you know, like Manhattan. And so what you have to say is, I know there's a good reason, I just can't remember when I get there, when I get to the finish line, it'll all come back. That's not the only thing he says.

He remembers, he fills his mind with the penultimate goal, but he also fills his mind with the ultimate goal. He says, how can I do this thing and sin against God? Now, how could this be a sin against God?

Now, it could be a sin against Potiphar, the husband, yeah, it could be a sin against Potiphar's wife. It wouldn't be that hard to say if he had given into her in the midst of her passion that she was giving in, he was sending against her. He certainly could say he was sending against himself in his own body, but how God?

正如你们所见，罪恶让性欲变得极其强大。那么他是如何处理这种情况的呢？他这样处理：首先，有两件事他做了。其中一件非常明显。

另一件不太明显。他控制了自己的行为。你注意到这里说他拒绝与她在一起。你看出来了吗？

他说不仅拒绝同床，而且他也远离了她，远离了诱惑。我们上周已经讨论过这一点。但另外一件事是他不仅仅控制自己的行为，还控制了自己的思想。詹姆斯·菲克斯，那位写了《跑步完全指南》的人，在书中有一个非常有趣的地方提到，对于长跑来说，最难的是你的大脑。

他发现，在成为马拉松选手的初期阶段，当你在比赛中感到极度疲劳时，你的大脑会问：你为什么要开始这场比赛？是什么吸引了你对长距离跑步的兴趣？詹姆斯·菲克斯说，我找不到答案。我记不起为什么想这样做。

他说过有一次他在比赛中途退出了，因为当压力很大时，大脑会玩弄一些把戏，他说，在炎热的天气里，你的大脑会突然决定忘记你喜欢跑步的原因，忘记长跑对你的好处、这次比赛对你的好处，你甚至记不起来这些原因了。所以他说到，如果要跑完那场马拉松般的艰难时期，他说，在开始之前，你必须几乎把为什么喜欢跑步的理由背下来。记住这些理由很重要。记住它们是为了告诉你的大脑。

但他又说，你知道吗？如果真的情况很糟糕，记不起来怎么办呢？他怎么说的呢？他说：“我知道当我到达终点时，我会记得这一切。

”他知道他有充分的理由开始这段旅程。现在这里面有很多智慧，而约瑟夫就是这样做的。约瑟夫说：“我怎么能做这种邪恶的事，背叛上帝呢？” 这就是他的想法。

他对自己说了两件事。首先，他说：“我怎么能做这种邪恶的事？”这指的是我们还没有结婚的事实。所以他提醒自己婚姻的终极目的是身体和灵魂的绝对结合，而不是将它们分开，而是要保持它们在一起。

然后他做了什么？他对自己的说：“我不会成为怪物。我不会自毁。我不会拆散上帝所结合的人。

”但如果约瑟夫完全记不起来怎么办呢？顺便提一句，如果你完全记不起来，你可以这样说：没有婚姻之外的性行为。这是2000年来基督教各派——天主教和新教、犹太教、儒教、印度教、伊斯兰教——达成共识的事情。所有这些伟大的宗教在很多其他问题上意见不同，但在这一点上他们完全一致。

唯一不相信这一点的人是那些非常近期才出现的小群体，就像曼哈顿那样。所以你必须说：“我知道有一个很好的理由，当我到达终点时，一切都会回来。”这并不是他唯一说的话。他记得，他在心里装满了终极目标，但也在心里装满了最高尚的目标。

他说：“我怎么能够做这件事，却得罪神呢？”现在，这怎么能是得罪神呢？现在，如果他屈服于她的热情之中，那确实可能算是对波提乏的不忠，或者对波提乏的妻子不忠。如果他在她激情中背叛了她，当然可以说也是在背叛自己。

## 性的终极目的：指向上帝的路标 / The Ultimate Purpose of Sex: A Signpost to God

And here's the reason, because I told you there were two goals for sex and this is the ultimate goal. And the ultimate goal of sex is to be an appetizer and a sign of the absolute ecstasy and joy of complete union with God. Sex is a sign and an api-biblical, according to biblical theology, sex is a foretaste and a sign and a signpost pointing toward the unbelievable joy and ecstasy of complete union with God.

In Ephesians 5, the New Testament says, that when a husband and wife unite, it's a great mystery, but it tells us, it shows us Christ uniting with His people. In Romans 7, Paul is so explicit. He says, just as a husband and wife get into each other's arms and through sexual union, fruit is born into the world through the woman's body.

So when Christ and the believer are in each other's arms, Christ's fruit is born into the world through you unbelievable, it's what the Bible says. Sex is a foretaste of that. When sex is the best possible here, what do you want?

What do you get? You want somebody to see you completely and not just tolerate it. See you naked, not just tolerate it, but you want to see their delight in you.

As they see you, you want to see in their eyes them looking at you as if you are holy and without blemish. This is the reason we look in mirrors. This is the reason a lot of people don't want to have sex or get married.

You're afraid of what people are going to see. You can cover it up. There's always cosmetics.

There's all sorts of ways of covering up, but here the idea that somebody will see you, what you really want in sex, if somebody see you and know you completely and then delight in you as if you were holy and without blemish. Then you want somebody's arms to come around you and give you a cradle of absolute security for your moment of absolute vulnerability and you want to do the same. You know what?

Nobody can do that. What's funny is when sex is going well and when love is going well, the only way we can talk about it is in religious language. This is the sexual proof of the existence of God that sex, love, makes you talk about things that aren't true.

You start to say, I will love you forever. You know, even the great, even the drippy songs. They go on and on.

They say longer than there have been fishes in the ocean, higher than any bird ever flew, longer than there have been stars up in the heaven. I've been in love with you. And we go, oh, why?

Because your sexuality is pointing to the eternal. Even when you think you've got it, you don't have it. It's an illusion.

Your sexual desire once a kind of cosmic closure that no one here on Earth can give you. Nobody can love you like that. Nobody will ever be able to truly say, I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever forsake you.

Because people die. People are sinners. Nobody can look at you and see you holding without blemish, except one who does say, I will never leave you and ever forsake you.

Who does say, in my sight, you are holding without blemish because I've died for you and I've closed you with my own righteousness. I've decked you with jewels. You know, it's a great sin against God to try to get closure out of somebody else that only God can give.

And so Christians are able to demystify sex. And that's what he was doing. A Christian is somebody who says, this is a sin, if my sexual desire is rather a controlist because I'm trying to get closure out of somebody who can never give it to me, I'm going to demote it.

Sex is a great thing. I hope I will have a wonderful sex life someday. But if I let this drive me, I'm trying to get something that it can never give.

Trying to get something out of it can never give. Self-control comes not by thinking of sex who negatively. Christian self-control comes by thinking of sex gloriously, that it puts it in a sense in its place here and now.

What God does, if you're obedient, like Joseph, what does it say? Verse 21, God was with him. If you're obedient like Joseph, you're going to experience rejection.

You're going to experience temporary isolation. You're going to have people laugh at you just like Joseph. But you know what?

Potterford must have actually trusted, he must have at least doubted, Joseph integrity must have been so incredibly good that when his wife came and accused him, there must have been doubts in Potterford's mind because what he was accused of was a capital offense. We know that. And so Potterford must have had doubts.

His integrity was so great that it saved him even at a moment like that. God was with him and he'll be with you.

但怎么可以说是得罪了神呢？原因就在于此，因为之前我告诉过你们，性有两重目的，而这正是最高尚的目的。性最高的目的是作为与神完全结合的前奏和预兆，象征着绝对的喜乐和喜悦。根据圣经神学，性是尝味、预示和指向与神完全结合那无法言喻的喜乐和喜悦。

在《以弗所书》5章中，新约说当夫妻结合时，这是一个伟大的奥秘，但它告诉我们，它显示了基督与祂子民的结合。在《罗马书》7章中，保罗说得非常明确：就像丈夫和妻子互相拥抱并通过性交生下孩子一样，通过女人的身体，世界也因他们的结合而得到果实。所以当基督和信徒彼此相拥时，基督的果子就通过你传入了这个世界——这正是圣经所说的。性是这种喜乐的预示。

当性成为最好的时候，你想得到什么？你会得到什么？你想让人完全地看见你，不只是容忍你。想被人赤裸裸地看到，不只是容忍，而是希望他们能喜悦于你。

当你被看见时，你也想在他们的目光中看到他们把你视为圣洁无瑕的人。这就是我们照镜子的原因。这也是很多人不愿发生性关系或结婚的原因之一。你害怕别人会看到什么。

你可以遮掩它。总是有化妆品可以掩饰。有各种各样的掩饰方法，但这里讲的是，当有人真正看到你、了解你最真实的一面，并且以圣洁无瑕的你为乐时，你想要有人的臂膀环绕着你，给你绝对的安全感，而你也想给予同样的安全感。你知道吗？

没有人能做到这一点。有趣的是，在性关系和爱情进展顺利的时候，我们唯一能谈论的方式就是用宗教语言。这就是性证明上帝存在的证据：性与爱让你谈论那些不真实的事情。你会开始说：“我会永远爱你。

”即使是伟大的歌，甚至是有些拖沓的歌曲，也会说比海洋里的鱼还多，比任何鸟儿飞得还要高，比天上的星星还要长久。“我一直在爱你。”然后我们会问，“为什么？” 因为你的性欲指向永恒。

即使你以为你已经得到了，其实并没有得到。这是一种幻觉。你的性欲望曾是一种宇宙般的闭合，但没有人能在这个地球上给你这种闭合感。没有人能像那样爱你。

没有人能够真正地说：“我永远不会离弃你。” 因为人会死，人都有罪。除了那位说“我永不离开你，也永不离弃你”的人，没有任何人能看着你而看到你是圣洁无瑕的。因为祂说：“在我的眼中，你是圣洁无瑕的，因为我为你死了，并以我的公义遮盖了你。

”试图从别人那里得到只有上帝才能给予的闭合感，是对上帝极大的不敬。因此，基督徒能够祛魅性爱。他正在做这件事。一个基督徒会说：如果我的性欲望变成一种控制欲，因为我在寻求别人永远无法给我的东西，那么我就会降低这种欲望的地位。

性是件美好的事情，我希望有一天我能拥有美好的性生活。但如果让这种欲望驱使自己，那是在追求它永远不能给予的东西。尝试从中获取什么永远得不到。自制力不是通过想着负面的性来获得，而是通过将性视为荣耀之事来获得。

如果你像约瑟那样顺服上帝，神会如何对待你？参见第21节：“神与他同在。”如果你像约瑟一样顺服，你会经历被排斥，暂时的孤立，甚至有人会嘲笑你，就像约瑟一样。但你知道什么吗？

波特福德一定是真正信任约瑟，至少对他的正直有所怀疑。因为被指控的事情是重罪，所以波特福德一定有过疑虑。约瑟的正直如此之高，以至于即使在那种情况下也能保护他。神与他同在，也会与你同在。

## 恩典临到破碎者：我也不定你的罪 / Grace for the Broken: Neither Do I Condemn You

But what, I know somebody's asking, what if Joseph's not really my model?

What if I'm a lot more like Potterford's wife? What does Jesus say to me? He says the same thing to you that he said to the woman caught an adultery.

He stood there before her and what did he say to her? He wouldn't cast a stone. Why?

He said to her, go and sin no more. Neither do I condemn thee. And you know what's so amazing?

When he said that, first of all, he called sin sin. He said, don't sin anymore. He didn't say it wasn't a sin.

Sexual sin is sin. But then he said, neither do I condemn thee. Wait.

If you say someone's guilty, then you have to condemn them. And if you say they're not condemned, then they must, they must not be guilty. Jesus says, you're guilty and I don't condemn you.

How could he say that? I know why. Do you know what was going on in his mind when he was saying that?

He was saying, my dear sister, you're guilty. But there's no condemnation for you because I'm not throwing a stone at you because I'm going to take the stones that should come to you. I'm going to take the spear.

I'm going to take the thorns. I'm going to take the fever and the bloody sweat so that in yours, in my sight and in my father's sight, you can be holy and blameless. If you receive Christ, one of the greatest things that happens in the genealogies of Matthew, Matthew chapter 1, verse 1, and following, it gives you the family tree of the Messiah and in the family tree of the Messiah is Tamar.

Tamar, the incest victim, Bathsheba, the adulteress, Rahab, the prostitute, Mary, a single unwed mother. What are they doing in the family tree? Jesus Christ says, I'm proud of you.

I don't care what you've done. I don't care what you've done. If you receive me, I'm proud of you.

Go and send no more. Neither do I condemn me. If you name your sin, he will say peace to you.

But if you say peace to yourself, he will name your sin. That's how it works. Come to him, let's pray.

Our father, we ask that you would make us so aware of the glorious nature of this sexual nature that you've given us, that we might find ourselves in wonderful self-control. Teach us how to understand, how to handle, and how to be healed. In those aspects of our sexuality where we are wounded and broken, because of your son, who said, neither do I condemn thee.

Go and send no more. And Jesus, name we pray. Amen.

但有人可能会问：如果约瑟不是我的榜样呢？如果我更像是波特福德的妻子怎么办？耶稣对那个被捉到行淫的女人说了什么？祂站在她面前，对她说：“拿石头打她的，就拿石头来吧。

”为什么没有立刻判罪呢？祂对她说：“去吧，从此不要再犯罪了。我也不会定你的罪。” 最令人惊讶的是什么呢？

当祂这么说时，首先，祂承认了罪的存在，并说：“不要再犯罪了。” 他并没有否认这是罪。性罪就是罪。但接着祂又说：“我也不会定你的罪。

” 等一下。如果你说某人有罪，那你必须定他的罪；如果你说你不定他的罪，那他就一定没有罪。耶稣说：你有罪，但我并不定你的罪。祂怎么能这么说呢？

我知道原因是什么。你知道祂当时在想什么吗？祂在说：“亲爱的姐妹，你是有罪的，但你不会有定罪，因为我不会向你投掷石块，而是要接过本该投向你的石块。” 我将承担荆棘，承担热病和流血的汗珠，好使你在我的眼中，在我父亲的眼中，可以成为圣洁无瑕。

如果你接受基督，马太福音第一章第一 verse 一直到后面的家谱里有一件最伟大的事情发生——它给你呈现了弥赛亚的家谱，在这个家谱中有提幔人塔玛。提幔人塔玛是乱伦受害者，拔示巴是通奸妇，拉哈伯是妓女，马利亚是一个未婚的母亲。他们为什么出现在弥赛亚的家谱中？耶稣基督说：我为你们感到骄傲。

无论你做了什么，我都不会在意。只要你接受我，我就为你感到骄傲。去吧，不要再犹豫了。我也不会谴责你。

如果你承认你的罪，他会给你平安。但如果你自我宽恕，他就会指出你的罪。这就是运作方式。来见他，让我们祷告。

我们的父啊，求你使我们认识到你所赐予的性之荣耀本质，使我们在其中找到美好的自制力。教导我们如何理解、如何处理以及如何治愈。在那些因你儿子所说“我不再谴责你”而受伤和破碎的部分，愿你在其中为我们带来医治。去吧，不要再犹豫了。

求耶稣接纳我们。阿们。感谢您收听《福音不喜欢播客》。希望今天的教诲能激励您更深入地研读神的话语。
