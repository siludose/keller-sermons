## 《人的废除》与事实-价值分裂 / The Abolition of Man and the Fact-Value Divide

Yeah, I was actually a real-life formal teacher for five years at Graduate School Seminary actually lectured and I created tests and I graded tests and papers for five years. I said, get me back in the ministry where you can teach and teach you nobody knows whether the people are learning or not.

It's wonderful. There's no way to find out. It seems like so, took all the pressure off.

Let me, let, yes, okay. Let me suggest, the only book that CS Lewis ever wrote on public education, that's what this book's supposedly about, the abolition of man, little booksy, short books, the sort of thing that everybody wants. Let me share two thoughts from the book.

If you are a teacher and have never read it, or if you haven't read it in a long time, I suggest you read it because it is about education. The first essay is called Men Without Chests, very famous and in it, he takes a book that was written at the time, I guess, in the 1940s, a book that was supposedly a textbook for English literature for high school students, what we call high school. And in the book, there's this great quote here, that Lewis quotes.

He says, the textbook says, when people say a waterfall is sublime, they think they are saying something very important about the waterfall, but they are only saying something about their feelings about the waterfall. And Lewis pointed out that this is the very essence of modern, this is the essence of modernity. This is the essence of modern Western culture.

What they were saying is, if you talk about an objective fact, something that can be proven, something that's empirically investigatable, that's a fact. But if you say anything that can't be proven empirically, if you say adultery is a sin, or I believe in God, or a waterfall is sublime, you're just talking about feelings. It's subjective.

It's not really important, David said. And Lewis points out, this is the essence, and this is if you're a public school teacher, this is the essence of your problem. That you're allowed to talk about, supposedly, you're allowed to talk about anything that's subjective, empirically proven, something that can be rationally investigated.

But when it comes to moral values, religious beliefs, I believe in God, I think adultery is wrong. Whenever you get into anything that can't be proven, that's subjective. That's supposed to be kept private.

You're not allowed to talk about that. It's of course a big hot issue, but in politics, am I allowed to bring my moral views into the public realm? Some people say, no, of course not.

You don't bring your religious or moral views into the public, into politics. There we only talk about what's reasonable and rational, not what you think is your moral values. Lewis responds by saying, if you really believe that everything is relative, and it comes to morality, he has this very famous place where he says, he says, if you're actually educating students in this way, if you're actually educating students to believe, that things that are objective, fact, are one thing.

But all moral views, all views about morality, religion, or anything like that is completely subjective, completely to be kept private. Completely relative, that is, to your individual consciousness or to the culture you're in. He says, you realize what's going to happen, and this is the quote that ends that essay.

He says, you can hardly open a periodical without coming across a statement that our civilization needs drive or more self-sacrifice. In a sort of ghastly simplicity, we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect to them virtue and enterprise.

We laugh at honor and our shock to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And what he's really saying is, if you really say everything is relative, except that which is empirically proven, self-sacrifice, why be self-sacrificial?

Why care about the common good? Why be a good citizen? Why?

He says, you can't educate people like that. So what's the answer? He actually brings out something called the Dow.

And what he means by the Dow, T-A-O, taken by way from the Chinese idea that there is a kind of, it's natural law. He says he believes that, and most all religions believe, that the religions actually differ on many things like how you're saved. All human beings have some basic understanding of God and some basic understanding of right and wrong that we kind of know intuitively.

And Lewis makes a case that on the basis of that, what Catholics would call natural law and what Protestants would call common grace. On the basis of the fact that people know some things intuitively, you can educate and you can appeal on the basis of this understanding that there's such a thing as common grace. Now, what do I mean by that?

是的，我实际上是一位真正的正式教师，在研究生院神学院教了五年，实际上我讲课，我出考题，我给考卷和论文打分，整整五年。我说，让我回到事工中去，在那里你可以教导，但没有人知道人们是否在学习。

太美妙了。没有办法知道。看起来似乎是这样，这让所有的压力都消失了。

让我，让，是的，好的。让我建议，C.S.路易斯唯一一本关于公共教育的书，这本书应该是关于这个的，《人的废除》，小册子，短小的书，那种每个人都想要的。让我分享这本书中的两个想法。

如果你是一位教师，从未读过它，或者如果你很长时间没有读过它，我建议你读一读，因为它是关于教育的。第一篇文章叫做《没有胸膛的人》，非常有名，在其中，他引用了当时写的一本书，我想是在1940年代，一本据说是给高中生的英国文学教科书，我们称之为高中的。在这本书中，路易斯引用了这段很棒的引文。

他说，教科书说，当人们说瀑布是崇高的时候，他们认为他们在说一些关于瀑布的非常重要的事情，但他们只是在说一些关于他们对瀑布的感觉。路易斯指出，这是现代性的本质。这是现代西方文化的本质。

他们说的是，如果你谈论客观事实，可以证明的东西，可以实证调查的东西，那是事实。但是如果你说任何无法用实证证明的东西，如果你说通奸是罪，或者我相信上帝，或者瀑布是崇高的，你只是在谈论感觉。这是主观的。

这并不真正重要，大卫说。路易斯指出，这是本质，如果你是一位公立学校教师，这是你问题的本质。据说你被允许谈论任何主观的、实证证明的、可以理性调查的东西。

但当涉及到道德价值观、宗教信仰，我相信上帝，我认为通奸是错误的。每当你进入任何无法证明的东西时，那都是主观的。那应该保持私密。

你不被允许谈论那个。当然这是一个大热点问题，但在政治中，我被允许把我的道德观带入公共领域吗？有些人说，不，当然不行。

你不能把你的宗教或道德观带入公共、带入政治。在那里我们只谈论什么是合理和理性的，而不是你认为的你的道德价值观。路易斯的回应是说，如果你真的相信一切都是相对的，当涉及到道德时，他有这个非常著名的地方，他说，他说，如果你实际上以这种方式教育学生，如果你实际上教育学生相信，客观的东西，事实，是一回事。

但所有道德观点，所有关于道德、宗教或类似东西的观点都是完全主观的，完全要保持私密。完全相对的，也就是说，相对于你的个人意识或你所在的文化。他说，你意识到会发生什么，这是结束那篇文章的引文。

他说，你几乎无法打开一份期刊而不遇到这样的声明：我们的文明需要动力或更多的自我牺牲。在一种可怕的简单性中，我们移除了器官却要求功能。我们制造没有胸膛的人，却期望他们有美德和进取心。

我们嘲笑荣誉，却对在我们中间发现叛徒感到震惊。我们阉割却命令被阉割者繁衍。他真正说的是，如果你真的说一切都是相对的，除了那些可以实证证明的，自我牺牲，为什么要自我牺牲？

为什么关心公共利益？为什么做一个好公民？为什么？

他说，你不能这样教育人。那么答案是什么？他实际上提出了一个叫做道的东西。

他所说的道，T-A-O，取自中国的观念，即存在一种，这是自然法。他说他相信，而且几乎所有宗教都相信，宗教在许多事情上实际上是不同的，比如你如何得救。所有人类对上帝都有一些基本的理解，对对错也有一些基本的理解，我们直觉上就知道。

路易斯提出，在此基础上，天主教徒称之为自然法，新教徒称之为普遍恩典。基于人们直觉地知道一些事情这一事实，你可以教育，你可以在这种理解的基础上诉诸，即存在普遍恩典这样的东西。现在，我是什么意思？

## 教育中的罪、恩典与普遍恩典 / Sin, Grace, and Common Grace in Education

It's actually very important for both people who are in Christian schools or private schools as well as public schools. And I'm here, by the way, I'm giving you a more Protestant view of natural, long common grace. The Protestant view is if you have a thin understanding of sin that is just breaking certain rules, you should make that more robust, a thick understanding of sin according to the Bible, a thick, robust view of sin, is that sin is making anything more central than God.

Sin is idolatry. So nationalism and making your family or making your moral record or making doctrinal purity, the thing that makes us better than everybody else. Those are all forms of idolatry and self-righteousness, but of course materialism, sex, power, aggressive violence.

They're all idols. And so a robust understanding of sin is not just your breaking rules because as you know, the Pharisees were horrible sinners because they were terribly self-righteous and filled with pride and were terrible people, even though they were being all the rules. Secondly, if you want to understand natural law and common grace, you have to have a thick understanding of grace.

And here's what I mean by a thick understanding of grace. You need to understand that in Romans chapter 1, verse 18 to 25, we read this. I can find it.

It says yes. Romans 1, 25 says, since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made, so men are without excuse. Now what's that saying is all human beings basically know the golden rule, basically know we must not be selfish, basically know we should care for our families, basically know a right and wrong, but they repress it.

But what's interesting is the verbs are being understood, are being seen, are present passive participles. And what that means is that at any given time, every human being on the face of the earth is experiencing, in their innermost being, a dialogue between what they know about God and what they know about right and wrong and their own idolatrous hearts. So every cultural product, every poem, every work of art, every essay, every op-ed piece, everything that is ever produced has, is a result of that dialogue, which means that if you're, if I'm a Christian and I'm producing a cultural product, which is a sermon by the way, that there's idolatry in it, there's something wrong with it, there's idolatrous discourse in it.

I'm in some way, I'm never quite hitting it just right, I might have pride in my own perspiterianism, I might have just a lack of humility in the way in which I speak. I mean, in other words, there's both truth in what I'm saying and idolatry. But in non-Christians, according to Romans 1, people who even overtly say they're not, they don't believe in God, when they produce movies, when they produce films and they produce art, when they produce essays, there's always some witness to God's truth in there.

It shows there's good things being stated by non-Christians all the time because of common grace. And C. S.

S. L. S.

says, you have to understand common grace, you have to have a robust view of sin and a robust view of grace if you're going to educate, and here's the reason why. If this is the case, this is one of the reasons why when I get asked this question, it's hard for me to believe that Christian education, Christian schools, or public education, Christians and public schools is, it's hard for me to believe that either one of those is the only way to go. It's hard for me to believe that's the only way to educate people.

It seems to me that if you're in a Christian school, I did have, as you're going to hear in a minute, I've had my children everywhere, which shows a lack of discipline or a lack of cohere in philosophy or maybe I have some other reasons, but it's not hard for me to see that when I put my kids in Christian schools very often they come out with some ways in which they're learning the Bible. You can see idolatrous discourse, you can see rigidity, I've never forgotten my first grade son comes home from his Christian school in Hope, Virginia, and he says, we were praying for the children in public schools today, why? Because they can't pray and their faith is being assaulted all the time, it's first greater.

While there's some idolatrous discourse in that, okay, that's all. On the other hand, in the public school, here you're going to be having to educate not by quoting the Bible if you're Christian, but by appealing to natural, uncommon grace. You have to expect that, first of all, people who aren't believers or who are believers and other religions are going to have some understanding of the truth, you know, just to give you a real example, obvious example, rape.

Almost everybody thinks rape is wrong, why? Can you prove it scientifically? Absolutely not.

Is it rational, well, it's practical, but there's no rational or empirical way to prove that rape is wrong. Why don't we all think rape is wrong? Why is it enshrined in our legislation?

And why can we say, in a public school room, that rape is wrong? Do you realize that's a value? That is a faith bleep.

That is something we believe is wrong, but we could never prove, but common grace and natural relation, no matter almost who we are, we all intuitively know it. Now what you have to do is you have to find those other places, you have to reason on the basis of natural, uncommon grace, and lastly, just to code here, one of the things that's important to realize is increasingly, though I need some of you are going to say, I don't see it, okay, but I see it. Increasingly it's going to be harder and harder for public schools or in fact for our public institutions to keep maintaining this difference between fact and value.

More and more people are recognizing that everything you say is based on faith assumptions, like I just gave you the example of rape. When someone says, we all know rape is wrong, why do we know rape is wrong? That's an act of faith.

That's a moral judgment. And when someone says, you can't bring your moral judgments into the classroom, you have to realize everybody's doing that. Everybody is saying, on the basis of my understanding of the nature of reality, on the basis of my understanding of the story that I think we're all in, there's an individualistic enlightenment story that says there's really no truth except human rights and we also be free to decide what is right around for us, but that's a story.

That's a way of understanding all of reality, it's a world view, it's a faith thing, you can't prove that. And if you're a Christian teacher, whether you're in private schools at our Christian or your public schools at our Christian or your Christian schools, it's going to be increasingly important and possible to show your students that everything that every statement practically comes embedded in a moral view of the world view, and you have to identify it as such. So you know, you say Martin Luther King Jr.

worked for civil rights because why did he do it? Did he say, everything is relative and every individual has to decide what is right of frame or hurt? He said, because the Bible says so, he did do that, he said, let justice roll down.

He was an African-American Protestant, and within his understanding, the reason, as you know, I guess the reason that black activists went into civil disobedience as opposed to what their white liberal friends said in the 1950s, was their white liberal friends were humanists who didn't believe the human beings were sinful. But the black activists who were reading Reinhold Niebuhr and the Bible, they did know that human beings were sinful, and they were never going to, that the Americans, white Americans would not give up power unless they were pushed, and that they wanted to do it in a way that was still Christian and loving, so they did civil disobedience, peaceful civil disobedience. You have to show that what Martin Luther King Jr.

did came out of a particular understanding of human nature and of God and of right and wrong, because everybody who says anything, even people who believe in human rights, that comes out of an enlightenment view of what life is like. Increasingly, you're going to be able, you're going to have to tell people these stories and let your students recognize how every moral claim, every claim of any sort is embedded in a worldview. You have to be able to say that, increasingly, the people at the top, the philosophers know there's no such thing as reason that is just unembedded in a particular understanding of ultimate reality, and increasingly, you're going to be able to do it too.

So on the basis of common grace, on the basis of this understanding of things, I actually think that it means those of us in Christian education, like me, have to recognize the limited nature of our Christian education. Those of you who are Christians in public education have to realize, I think, real possibilities for instructing people in wisdom, and maybe increasing possibilities in talking openly about various faith views. So now, I've saying that because my guess is that when I get these questions now, I'm going to tend to refer to this basic insight that comes from the abolition of men.

这对于在基督教学校或私立学校以及公立学校的人来说实际上都非常重要。顺便说一下，我在这里给你一个更偏新教的自然、长期普遍恩典的观点。新教的观点是，如果你对罪有一个薄弱的理解，即只是打破某些规则，你应该使之更加稳固，根据圣经对罪的厚实理解，对罪的厚实、稳固的观点，是罪是让任何东西比上帝更中心。

罪是偶像崇拜。所以民族主义，让你的家庭或让你的道德记录或让教义纯洁成为使我们比其他人更好的东西。这些都是偶像崇拜和自以为义的形式，但当然还有物质主义、性、权力、攻击性暴力。

它们都是偶像。所以对罪的稳固理解不仅仅是你在打破规则，因为你知道，法利赛人是可怕的罪人，因为他们非常自以为义，充满骄傲，是可怕的人，尽管他们遵守所有的规则。其次，如果你想理解自然法和普遍恩典，你必须对恩典有厚实的理解。

这是我所说的对恩典的厚实理解的意思。你需要理解在罗马书第1章，第18到25节，我们读到这个。我能找到它。

它说是的。罗马书1章25节说，自从创造世界以来，上帝不可见的品质已经清楚地被看见，从所造之物中被理解，所以人无可推诿。现在它说的是所有人基本上都知道黄金法则，基本上知道我们不能自私，基本上知道我们应该关心我们的家庭，基本上知道对错，但他们压抑它。

但有趣的是，动词是被理解，被看见，是现在被动分词。这意味着在任何给定时间，地球上的每一个人在他们内心深处都在经历一场对话，在他们对上帝的了解和他们对对错的了解与他们自己的偶像崇拜之心之间的对话。所以每一个文化产品，每一首诗，每一件艺术品，每一篇文章，每一篇专栏文章，所有曾经产生的东西，都是那场对话的结果，这意味着如果你是，如果我是一个基督徒，我正在制作一个文化产品，顺便说一下，这是一篇讲道，其中有偶像崇拜，有些地方是错误的，其中有偶像崇拜的话语。

我在某种程度上，我从来没有完全做对，我可能对我自己的长老会主义感到骄傲，我可能在我说话的方式上只是缺乏谦卑。我的意思是，换句话说，在我所说的话中既有真理也有偶像崇拜。但在非基督徒中，根据罗马书1章，即使是那些公开说他们不相信上帝的人，当他们制作电影，当他们制作电影和艺术，当他们制作文章时，总是有一些对上帝真理的见证。

它表明非基督徒一直在说好话，因为普遍恩典。而C.S.路易斯说，你必须理解普遍恩典，如果你要教育，你必须对罪和恩典有一个稳固的观点，这就是原因。如果是这种情况，这是当我被问到这个问题时的原因之一，我很难相信基督教教育、基督教学校，或公共教育，公立学校的基督徒，我很难相信这两者中的任何一个是唯一的出路。我很难相信那是教育人的唯一方式。

在我看来，如果你在基督教学校，我确实有，正如你将在一分钟内听到的，我的孩子们到处都去过，这显示了缺乏纪律或缺乏哲学的连贯性，或者也许我有其他原因，但我不难看到，当我把我的孩子送进基督教学校时，他们经常出来时以某些方式在学习圣经。你可以看到偶像崇拜的话语，你可以看到僵化，我永远不会忘记我的一年级儿子从他在弗吉尼亚州霍普的基督教学校回家，他说，我们今天为公立学校的孩子们祷告，为什么？因为他们不能祷告，他们的信仰一直受到攻击，这是一年级。

虽然其中有一些偶像崇拜的话语，好的，就是这样。另一方面，在公立学校，你将不得不不是通过引用圣经来教育，如果你是基督徒，而是通过诉诸自然、不常见的恩典。你必须期望，首先，那些不是信徒或信奉其他宗教的人会对真理有一些理解，你知道，只是给你一个真实的例子，明显的例子，强奸。

几乎每个人都认为强奸是错误的，为什么？你能科学地证明它吗？绝对不能。

它是理性的吗，嗯，它是实际的，但没有理性或实证的方法来证明强奸是错误的。为什么我们都认为强奸是错误的？为什么它被纳入我们的立法？

为什么我们可以在公立学校的教室里说强奸是错误的？你意识到那是一个价值观吗？那是一个信仰的判断。

那是我们相信是错误的东西，但我们永远无法证明，但普遍恩典和自然启示，几乎无论我们是谁，我们都直觉地知道它。现在你必须做的是你必须找到那些其他地方，你必须基于自然、不常见的恩典进行推理，最后，只是在这里编码，要意识到的重要事情之一是越来越多，尽管我需要你们中的一些人会说，我看不到它，好的，但我看到了。越来越难让公立学校或实际上让我们的公共机构继续维持事实和价值之间的这种差异。

越来越多的人认识到，你说的每一件事都是基于信仰假设的，就像我刚才给你举的强奸的例子。当有人说，我们都知道强奸是错误的，为什么我们知道强奸是错误的？那是一种信仰行为。

那是一个道德判断。当有人说，你不能把你的道德判断带入课堂，你必须意识到每个人都在这样做。每个人都在说，基于我对现实本质的理解，基于我认为我们都在其中的故事的理解，有一个个人主义的启蒙故事，说除了人权之外没有真正的真理，我们也可以自由决定什么对我们来说是正确的，但那是一个故事。

那是一种理解所有现实的方式，那是一个世界观，那是一个信仰的东西，你无法证明。如果你是一位基督教教师，无论你是在我们基督教的私立学校还是我们基督教的公立学校还是你的基督教学校，越来越重要并且可能向你的学生展示，几乎每一个陈述都嵌入在对世界观的道德观中，你必须将其识别为这样。所以你知道，你说马丁·路德·金为民权而努力，为什么他这样做？他是说，一切都是相对的，每个人都必须决定什么对框架或伤害是正确的吗？他说，因为圣经这么说，他确实这么做了，他说，让公义如大水滚滚。

他是一位非裔美国新教徒，在他的理解中，原因，你知道，我想黑人活动家进入公民不服从的原因，而不是他们的白人自由派朋友在1950年代所说的，是他们的白人自由派朋友是人道主义者，他们不相信人类是有罪的。但是阅读莱因霍尔德·尼布尔和圣经的黑人活动家，他们确实知道人类是有罪的，他们永远不会，美国人，白人美国人不会放弃权力，除非他们被推动，他们想以一种仍然是基督教和有爱的方式来做，所以他们进行了公民不服从，和平的公民不服从。你必须展示马丁·路德·金所做的是出于对人性、上帝和对错的特定理解，因为每个说任何话的人，甚至相信人权的人，那都是出于对生活是什么样的启蒙观点。越来越多，你将能够，你将不得不告诉人们这些故事，让你的学生认识到每一个道德主张，任何种类的主张如何嵌入在一个世界观中。你必须能够这样说，越来越多，顶层的人，哲学家知道没有所谓的理性只是不嵌入在对终极现实的特定理解中，而且越来越多，你也将能够做到。

所以基于普遍恩典，基于这种对事物的理解，我实际上认为这意味着我们这些在基督教教育中的人，像我一样，必须认识到我们基督教教育的有限性。你们那些在公共教育中的基督徒必须意识到，我认为，在教导人们智慧方面的真正可能性，也许在公开谈论各种信仰观点方面越来越多的可能性。所以现在，我这样说是因为我猜当我现在得到这些问题时，我倾向于参考这个来自《人的废除》的基本见解。

## 选择学校：公立、基督教和家庭学校 / Choosing Schools: Public, Christian, and Homeschool

Okay? So I'm supposed to lead for the next 45 minutes. Well, I'm supposed to take questions and I think what this means is panel.

You're supposed to shoot me questions about, first of all, what kind of school, private, public, Christian, home schooling, isn't that right, Catherine? Let's try, let's shoot me questions about that for a while, and I'll try to make answers, and you can maybe respond, and then I'll start to. I think when we talk about choices and philosophy, what really comes down to is how we live all lives and where we place our children and where we choose to live.

So I know from a long term relationship with you, actually, your youngest son went to a Bronx science and he had a math tutor who was a teacher to Christian school that I was running at the time. Right, my oldest son went to public school all the way through. All the way through.

New York public schools. New York public schools. But I know for sure that you sent your other children right to Christian boarding schools.

And my question that I had for you was how you've gone to that process, why, what the difference was in the choices, why you made those choices, and going back on reflection, how would your advice parents today to live their lives with their children? Okay, there's two questions. First would be, why did I do what I did?

My three sons, we've been here almost 16 years, well, over into our 16th year, our oldest son went through public school all the way. Our other two sons went to public school, Michael, my middle son went to public school until ninth grade and I sent him to Stony Brook, which is a Christian boarding school without one and a half away. And my youngest son, Jonathan, went, I think, till fourth grade to public school, from fifth grade to eighth grade, went to a Catholic school, so I'm really diverse, by the way.

And then went, and then he went to Stony Brook, the Christian boarding school as well. Number one, I really mean it. My wife, I talked about, make sure my wife and I were still in agreement on this before I came.

Is that we really do see advantages to the various forms of education. We do not, and I would be disappointed if Christians didn't vigorously go into every one of these kinds of education, private, Christian, private, and public. I think we can do a huge amount of good and renewal in each one of them.

And that's why, because I had no philosophical problems with any one of them, we were free to choose the one that we thought fit the kid. We didn't have a problem with Christian education or problem with public education, therefore we were able to make a choice. If he had gotten into towns and Harris, we might have kept him here.

He tried to get into towns and Harris, but in hindsight, we really made the right choice because he would have been living at home and that wasn't the best thing for him. Jonathan just insisted he wouldn't want to go to Stony Brook, too. And when we looked back on it, we're still not sure it was the best idea, but it was also...

we thought it was okay, and so he did it because he really, really wanted. And this is, by the way, those of you who are parents as well as teachers know, this is how you do this. You do it on a case-by-case basis.

Now, if we thought public school was no good, or Christian schools, no, no, no, none of that, we would have not been able to have all those options, but we have. In fact, by the way, on top of that, my sister, my dear sister, I love to the sky, is the best home schooler I know. She's home school.

A lot of people believe it or not. You say, well, not only all of her five children, but everybody else's children in the neighborhood, I think. And it's been...

so I've gone all around the block. What would we say today to... I would say the same thing, just to parents who are Christians that you do have a number of options and that you really ought to do it on a case-by-case basis, and I would actually hope that Christians would somehow be well-distributed.

I do think we actually need to need more Christian schools in a city than we've got. I also think we need Christians to be much more actively involved in the public schools and renewal of the public schools. I would like all the thousands of flowers to bloom.

I really think it's really possible. I think because a lot of us... it's hard...

if you're into public schools as a teacher, I hope you'll feel like this is the... there's nothing wrong with you feeling like your approach is the superior one. If you don't feel a little...

I mean, I like to... there's this really odd tension. I want to feel...

I want everybody on my staff to feel like there's no church-like redeemer. You know, you've got to feel like this is the greatest church. You have to be careful about that because it's more emotional than it is intellectual.

You stand back. You have to say no, wait a minute. There are a lot of other great churches.

So you should feel the same way if you're into public... if you want to create great Christian schools for the city and you define that and you really want to do that, that's all right for you to feel like this is my passion, this is what I want to do. And to feel like...

I want to recruit as many people into that as possible, and vice versa for public schools as well. So that's the reason why I... we have to do a case-by-case basis.

Okay, other questions? I just want to give a little background. I'm not a product of Christian and public schools, so I think not only what fits the...

what fits the child, but different times in the child's life, so I think you know, that's very important. I also just want to kind of make a point about why I'm sitting here as an administrator, as a direct result, Catherine mentioned that I'm in the Leadership Academy. The reason I'm in a Leadership Academy to make a very long story short is from a conversation on a site visit that Chancellor Klein had to a school that I was working at in East Flatbush, a failing school teacher there, and I couldn't wait till he got there to tell him everything that was wrong and to talk about, how can you let children live in these conditions?

So anyway, out of that conversation, and he said, well, how did you get the students to read? Their older siblings can't even read. And so did you do this?

And did you do that? And was it where you went to graduate school? And was it that?

And I said, actually, it's about creating a caring community for us. So every day in my classroom, I start with morning meetings and we talk about what it means to treat each other the way we want to be treated. And I went through this whole thing, expecting him to, you know, run away, because that has nothing to do with the reform effort that they were moving in terms of the unified curriculum.

And actually, his response was he listened for about 30 minutes and he said, can you please email all of that to me? And I thought, well, you know, that's just some kind of, you know, let me make her feel good. She gave me all this garbage or whatever.

But is the conversation went on? He said, as a matter of fact, I really need you to apply for this program. And I said, which program?

And he said, the leadership academy, and you know, nothing about it. And I said, oh, no, I want to be a teacher. I have no interest in administration.

And he said, I know, that's exactly why I need you there. So what I ended up emailing him was a policy memo, basically entitled transforming New York City Schools with the Golden Rule. And no doubt about it, that's been the voice that I've brought to the leadership academy and that I'm trying to bring to this school.

So I just want to say that that is very true that there's so many opportunities. And we're in such a crisis in public education that I'll be honest with you. They don't really care where you say it comes from as long as it works.

So what goes hand in hand with that is the quality. You can't go around and say I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian, and yet you're doing substandard work and too often that becomes a crutch. So I just want to re-emphasize that this is, you know, and for all of it, you know, not talking about politics.

There is an open opportunity to impact the schools. That's my context for the question that I agree with Tim. What I do have a problem with is that the loudest voices in Christianity today seem to be people that are anti-public schools and anti-having Christian students and public schools.

And I do believe that there's different settings for every child. But I just want to read a statement that kind of set off my whole concern. This is by Mr.

Rae Moore, who runs an organization called the Exodus Mandate that are asking all Christians to remove their students from their children from public schools. The quote is, a movement to purge the public schools of Christian children would literally electrify and invigorate the church as nothing has done in modern times. And might trigger the revival we are all awaiting so expectantly.

So that, and that's actually has supportive Dr. James Dobson of Kennedy. So this is what's circulating.

And I'm, you know, maybe not here, but in other places in the country. So I guess my question is, and I have asked this also to an email kind of dialogue with Mr. Moore, especially in a city like this in a crisis.

We can all acknowledge the crisis situation. What do we as Christians? What is our responsibility to students in the public schools?

And what are the ways that we can work together to bridge this divide between homeschool, private school, Christian school, as in church, you know, so I don't know if that's a question. No, it is. Let me, I'll say something.

I want to make sure Scott or somebody asked me a question about Christian school, if you will, I mean, so I, so the other shoe drops. But let me just say something good about, well, no, here. Should we just plant new churches?

Or should we renew the churches that exist in a city? Now, I've done a lot of thinking about that since I'm a church planter. And it is fairly easy when you plant a new church to give the impression or maybe even believe that all the other churches around here are dead and this just won't work.

So we have to start a new church that's really on fire. Now, the fact is that a city will not be reached for Christ only by new churches. There's tons and tons of people that will go to the existing church and only to the existing church.

The older church, the church that, you know, their parents and their grandparents were at, it's only going to read. That's the only way that a whole lot of people are going to be reached by the existing churches, the established churches, the older churches. It's also true that unless you start new churches, the older churches don't sometimes get, get pricked into making changes.

We really found it when Redeemer got started. We started doing a lot of stuff that the other churches and towns that would never work. It did work at Redeemer.

Next thing you know, they started doing it in the older churches. There actually is therefore a need for something like a Christian school movement and there's no doubt that there's a lot of schools that are outside of the public school system that can do things that the public school system can learn from. You've got to have renewal like that, but you also have to renew one of the public schools too.

You just can't abandon all the students in public schools. So I know the way to reach a city is to not only plant new churches, but to renew the old churches. It's not any other war at all.

Over the years there have been church planters who are like this people in this petition or this movement. They're really saying the existing church is just a whole lot of crap and it's going to hell in the hand car. We're just forgetting about it and everybody should come out and join us because we're the true new church.

It never works. It creates friction, sectarianism, so you just have to have both as simple as that. I think that would be the thing to say.

I really do believe there's going to be an opening more and more for Christians who are careful. Not being sectarian, understanding common grace and natural law. There's going to be a way for us to be able to talk in public settings about the faith basis for what we're saying because what you have to say, everybody's got one.

So, when you come and say this, look, that's a faith, there's a faith basis to that. You have to explain everybody, so reason for this is out, let me just finish this one. Alistair Macinty wrote a book in 1984 called After Virtue.

It's had a huge impact on the thought life, especially the philosophy world. He said you can never talk about something being good unless you ask, answer the question, what is it for? So, he may have heard me use this illustration.

You can't say whether it's a good watch unless you ask, what is it for? It's lousy for pampering nails, by the way, if you've ever tried. But it's wonderful for telling time.

So the question is, is it a good watch or not or is it a bad watch? It all depends on what it's built for, what's it for? As soon as you start to say, is this a good person?

Is this a good human being? You can't answer that question unless you ask, what are human beings for? What are they mean?

What is the meaning of human life? What are we here for? What is the important stuff?

And you can't answer that question from science. You can't. There's a Hindu answer, there's a Buddhist answer, there's an individualistic enlightenment answer, there's a secular answer, there's a Christian answer, there's a Jew, anybody who says anything about this is good behavior, this is bad behavior, is embedding it in a particular worldview, a set of faith assumptions.

There's no way that anybody can, if you say that well, in any public setting, nobody knows how to gain sight anymore. Because the enlightenment idea of some kind of objective, neutral view from nowhere is gone, everybody has been against understanding that. There's got to be a way for us as Christians, therefore, even in public education, to say, here's the way the Christian thing works, here's the way the Jewish thing works, here's the way the Hindu things work, and talk about it with our students.

Christianity, whenever it's compared, always looks pretty good. It's got a whole lot of great practitioners like Martin Luther King Jr., if you're allowed, for example, to make him what he really was, which is a minister of the gospel. And there's, we have an awful lot of really great examples, you can, I find in some way, if you're in a more vangelic church, where you're always working with non-Christians, you always are so excited about it, but you wonder, I wish I was in a church where there wasn't as much transience, and there was, the people were there from year to year, and I could work on discipleship.

In other words, I've been in churches where every, I had a church in Virginia, where nobody ever left, and nobody ever came, and I had a lot of, I was able to do a lot of discipleship and deep drill down theological education, but I, I had a passion for evangelism and reaching out. And I think if you're in public education, or if you're in Christian education, you're going to find, in general, that you get different things done. You're going to find one that enables you to kind of talk more, and reach out to people, and yet you always feel like, my hands are somewhat tied, I can't completely go down where I would like to go, and very often in Christian education sometimes you feel like it's kind of a hot house.

So I just don't know the one is the ideal, and I think we've got to have both, and anybody who gives the impression that everybody came out of public schools and wanted to Christian schools, that would be wrong, however. Because I'm doing this thing on Proverbs this year, I now understand probably what the goal of a school would be, would be wisdom, which is helping kids understand how life works, how the human heart works, so that they know how to make right choices, even in areas where the moral rules don't apply, that would be, and I think that what's interesting is that could be something to both public school teachers, who are Christians, and Christian school teachers could both be trying to do, they're going to go bad a little bit differently. Having said that, Scott, you want to ask your question?

Actually, I do, thank you. Since the schools are not reading yet, and that they are still to my understanding hostile to the faith, why should parents put their children in the hands of a school system that is so hostile, especially in light of the fact that even if the child is growing up in a Christian home, is aware of the gospel, perhaps, or the accepted Christ, their faith is still being formed, that it's not yet resilient, they can't stand on their own. Why would a parent turn their child over to such an institution when their opportunities to unwind that indoctrination is still limited?

I think that is, since I don't believe in neutrality and I don't believe there's such a thing, as I just said, therefore I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of putting my kid in the Christian school, my children who were in Christian school benefited from it, put it this way. I have found in New York that the real anti-Christian schools are private schools. In other words, Buckley and Chapin, not Bronx Science or Stivocent.

I think to be fair to non-Christian schools, we need to make that distinction. I've seen a huge difference, and now I found the public schools in the suburbs very often, and they're thinking, you either have secular people or Christian people, these crazy nutty Christians. Here in the city, the public school teachers are dealing with Hindus and Muslims and Buddhists and Jews and Christians and Orthodox Christians and Catholic Christians, and I found them incredibly careful and unbelievably respectful.

For example, every year, and in Roosevelt Island Elementary School, I was asked to come in along with a rabbi and along with a priest and we came in and we talked about the Holy Days because the Jewish teacher that public school teacher taught all of my kids all went through just said, look, I really want them to understand these different points of view, and she says, I'm even trying to make sure I don't let them think that I believe that they're all relative. Even though she was secular, but she said, I realize in a sense that she understood that if I just said, well, there's this view in this view and isn't it wonderful? Everybody's got their own religion, they're all equally valid.

Even to say that is actually a totalitarian point of view. That's it. Even though she could never say that's an enlightenment view, she understood that in a way that was putting secularism over the other religions.

And I think to some degree, she's scared, she's scared of some angry Hindu or Muslim or Christian parent coming in and screaming. And I guess in New York, everybody screams and so I found that public schools were extremely respectful of the different religions and weren't that hostile. And seemed to even have an intuitive understanding that even secularism couldn't be pushed down the throat of these kids, or else their parents were going to take their teachers' heads off.

I want you to know that when it comes to some of the quote unquote elite private schools in the city, where a lot of people want to send their kids, they're there's overtly hostile. And I'm not kidding. And they delight in dismantling any kind of traditional understanding of authority or morality.

And therefore I think you ought to make a distinction. That's the first thing. Secondly though, I was kind of glad that my kids, I think the two that were both in public school and Christian school probably benefited.

I think that then if they had been in Christian school all the way or had been in public school all the way, I saw some advantages of that. So I don't know what that tells you, I'm just a wishy watchy Charlie Brown guy. But I think you do have to watch very carefully because I think Scott's question is right.

If you're, I was talking to parents, I would say you really need to know how hostile or what your school district or your local school is like or what your, what the teacher's views are like because you really don't have the right to abandon me. The Bible, Deuteronomy 6 says, parents, you are responsible for your children's upbringing. And when I can't delegate that away, I mean I can delegate away the actual day in and day out work of teaching to somebody else but I can't delegate away the responsibility.

It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers? In other words, how can our work connect with God's work and how can our vocations be more emotional?

In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others. The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every good endeavor is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world.

好吗？所以我应该在接下来的45分钟里领导。嗯，我应该回答问题，我认为这意味着小组讨论。

你应该向我提问，首先，关于什么样的学校，私立、公立、基督教、家庭学校，不是吗，凯瑟琳？让我们试试，让我们向我提关于那个的问题一段时间，我会尝试回答，你可以回应，然后我会开始。我认为当我们谈论选择和哲学时，真正归结为我们如何生活所有的生活，我们把孩子放在哪里，我们选择住在哪里。

所以我从与你的长期关系中知道，实际上，你最小的儿子去了布朗克斯科学高中，他有一位数学家教，那个家教是我当时经营的基督教学校的老师。对，我的大儿子一直上公立学校。一直。

纽约公立学校。纽约公立学校。但我肯定知道你把你的其他孩子送到了基督教寄宿学校。

我的问题是你是如何经历那个过程的，为什么，选择有什么不同，你为什么做那些选择，回过头来反思，你今天会如何建议父母与他们的孩子一起生活？好的，有两个问题。首先，我为什么做我所做的？

我的三个儿子，我们在这里快16年了，嗯，进入第16年，我们的大儿子一直上公立学校。我们的另外两个儿子上公立学校，迈克尔，我的二儿子上公立学校直到九年级，我把他送到石溪，那是一所基督教寄宿学校，距离一个半小时。我最小的儿子乔纳森，我想，上公立学校到四年级，从五年级到八年级，去了一所天主教学校，所以我真的很多元化，顺便说一下。

然后去了，然后他也去了石溪，基督教寄宿学校。第一，我是认真的。我的妻子，我在来之前就和我妻子谈过，确保我妻子和我在这件事上仍然达成一致。

我们真的确实看到各种教育形式的优势。我们不会，如果基督徒不积极进入这些教育类型中的每一种，私立、基督教、私立和公立，我会感到失望。我认为我们可以在每一种中做大量的好事和更新。

这就是为什么，因为我对其中任何一个都没有哲学问题，我们可以自由选择我们认为适合孩子的那个。我们对基督教教育或公共教育都没有问题，因此我们能够做出选择。如果他进入了汤恩斯和哈里斯，我们可能会让他留在这里。

他试图进入汤恩斯和哈里斯，但事后看来，我们真的做出了正确的选择，因为他会住在家里，那对他来说不是最好的事情。乔纳森也坚持他不想去石溪。当我们回顾时，我们仍然不确定这是不是最好的主意，但它也是...我们认为这是可以的，所以他做了，因为他真的，真的想要。顺便说一下，这是，你们那些既是父母又是教师的人知道，这就是你如何做到这一点的。你是在个案基础上做的。

现在，如果我们认为公立学校不好，或者基督教学校，不，不，没有那个，我们就不会有所有这些选择，但我们有。事实上，顺便说一下，在此之外，我的妹妹，我亲爱的妹妹，我爱死她了，是我认识的最好的在家教育者。她在家教育。信不信由你，很多人。你说，嗯，不仅她的五个孩子，而且我想还有邻居的所有其他孩子。而且一直...所以我已经走遍了所有地方。我们今天会对...我会说同样的话，只是对那些是基督徒的父母，你确实有很多选择，你真的应该在个案基础上做，我实际上希望基督徒能够以某种方式分布良好。

我确实认为我们实际上需要在城市中有比我们现有的更多的基督教学校。我也认为我们需要基督徒更积极地参与公立学校和公立学校的更新。我希望所有成千上万的花朵都绽放。

我真的认为这真的是可能的。我认为因为我们很多人...很难...如果你作为教师进入公立学校，我希望你会觉得这是...你觉得你的方法是优越的没有什么错。如果你不觉得有点...我的意思是，我喜欢...有这种真正奇怪的张力。我想要感觉...我希望我员工中的每个人都觉得没有像救赎主这样的教会。你知道，你必须觉得这是最伟大的教会。你必须对此小心，因为它更多是情感而不是智力。

你退一步。你必须说不，等一下。还有很多其他伟大的教会。

所以如果你进入公立学校...如果你想为城市创建伟大的基督教学校，你定义了那个，你真的想做那个，你对此感到热情是可以的，这是我想做的。并且感觉...我想招募尽可能多的人加入，对公立学校也是如此。所以这就是为什么我...我们必须在个案基础上做。

好的，其他问题？我只想给一点背景。我不是基督教和公立学校的产品，所以我认为不仅是什么适合...什么适合孩子，而且孩子生活中的不同时期，所以我认为你知道，这非常重要。我还想提一点为什么我坐在这里作为一名管理人员，这是直接结果，凯瑟琳提到我在领导力学院。我在领导力学院的原因，长话短说，是来自校长克莱因对我在东弗拉特布什工作的一所学校进行实地访问时的一次对话，一所失败的学校，我在那里任教，我等不及他到那里告诉他一切错误的事情，谈论，你怎么能让孩子们生活在这些条件下？

所以无论如何，从那次对话中，他说，嗯，你是如何让学生阅读的？他们的哥哥姐姐甚至都不会阅读。那么你做这个了吗？你做那个了吗？是你上研究生院的地方吗？是那个吗？

我说，实际上，对我们来说，这是关于为我们创建一个关爱社区。所以我在教室里每天都从晨会开始，我们谈论以我们想要被对待的方式对待彼此意味着什么。我经历了这整个事情，期待他，你知道，逃跑，因为那与他们在统一课程方面推进的改革努力无关。

实际上，他的反应是他听了大约30分钟，他说，你能把所有那些都发给我吗？我想，嗯，你知道，那只是某种，你知道，让我让她感觉良好。她给了我所有这些垃圾或其他什么。

但随着对话的进行？他说，事实上，我真的需要你申请这个项目。我说，哪个项目？

他说，领导力学院，你知道，对它一无所知。我说，哦，不，我想当老师。我对行政管理没有兴趣。

他说，我知道，这正是我需要你在那里的原因。所以我最终发给他的是一份政策备忘录，基本上题为《用黄金法则改造纽约市学校》。毫无疑问，这一直是我带到领导力学院的声音，也是我试图带到这所学校的声音。

所以我只想说，这是非常真实的，有这么多机会。我们在公共教育中处于如此危机之中，我会对你坦白。只要它有效，他们真的不在乎你说它来自哪里。

所以伴随而来的是质量。你不能到处说我是基督徒，我是基督徒，但你在做不合格的工作，这太经常成为一个拐杖。所以我只想重新强调这是，你知道，对于所有这些，你知道，不谈论政治。

有一个开放的机会来影响学校。这是我问题的背景，我同意蒂姆的观点。我确实有一个问题，那就是今天基督教中最响亮的声音似乎是反对公立学校和反对让基督徒学生上公立学校的人。

我确实相信每个孩子都有不同的环境。但我只想读一个引发我整个关注的声明。这是雷·摩尔先生的，他经营一个叫做出埃及授权的组织，要求所有基督徒将他们的学生、他们的孩子从公立学校中移除。这段引文是，一场清除公立学校中基督教儿童的运动将真正电击和激励教会，就像现代没有任何事情所做的那样。并且可能触发我们都在如此期待地等待的复兴。

所以那个，那个实际上得到了肯尼迪的詹姆斯·多布森博士的支持。所以这就是正在流传的。

我，你知道，也许不是在这里，但在全国其他地方。所以我想我的问题是，我也在与摩尔先生的电子邮件对话中问过这个问题，尤其是在像这样处于危机中的城市。

我们都可以承认危机情况。我们作为基督徒有什么责任？我们对公立学校的学生有什么责任？

我们可以用什么方式共同努力来弥合家庭学校、私立学校、基督教学校之间的这种分歧，就像在教会中一样，你知道，所以我不知道那是不是一个问题。不，它是。让我，我会说点什么。

我想确保斯科特或某人问我一个关于基督教学校的问题，如果你愿意，我的意思是，所以我，所以另一只鞋掉下来了。但让我说点好话，嗯，不，在这里。我们应该只是建立新教会吗？

或者我们应该更新城市中存在的教会？现在，我已经对此进行了很多思考，因为我是一个植堂者。当你建立一个新教会时，很容易给人印象或者甚至相信这里所有其他的教会都死了，这是行不通的。

所以我们必须建立一个真正火热的新教会。现在，事实是，一个城市不会仅仅通过新教会为基督所得着。有成千上万的人会去现有的教会，而且只去现有的教会。

旧教会，教会，你知道，他们的父母和祖父母在的教会，只会读。这是很多人将被现有教会、已建立的教会、旧教会所得着的唯一方式。同样真实的是，除非你建立新教会，旧教会有时不会被刺激做出改变。

当救赎主开始时我们真的发现了这一点。我们开始做很多其他教会和镇上的事情，那永远行不通。它在救赎主那里确实奏效了。

你接下来知道，他们开始在旧教会里做它。因此实际上需要像基督教学校运动这样的东西，毫无疑问，有很多学校在公立学校系统之外，可以做公立学校系统可以学习的事情。你必须有那样的更新，但你也必须更新公立学校中的一所。你不能放弃公立学校的所有学生。所以我知道到达一个城市的方法是不仅建立新教会，而且更新旧教会。根本不是其他战争。

多年来，有些植堂者就像这个请愿或这个运动中的人。他们真的在说现有的教会只是一堆废话，它正在手车里下地狱。我们只是忘记它，每个人都应该出来加入我们，因为我们是真正的新教会。

它从来不起作用。它制造摩擦、宗派主义，所以你只需要两者都有，就这么简单。我认为那就是要说的事情。

我确实相信对于那些小心的基督徒来说，会有越来越多的开放。不要宗派主义，理解普遍恩典和自然法。我们将有办法在公共环境中谈论我们所说的信仰基础，因为你必须说的，每个人都有一个。

所以，当你来说这个，看，那是一个信仰，那有一个信仰基础。你必须向每个人解释，所以这样做的原因是，让我完成这一个。阿拉斯代尔·麦金太尔在1984年写了一本书叫《美德之后》。

它对思想生活，尤其是哲学界产生了巨大影响。他说，除非你问，回答这个问题，它是为什么而存在的，否则你永远无法谈论某物是好的。所以，你可能听过我使用这个例证。

你不能说它是否是一块好手表，除非你问，它是为什么而存在的？顺便说一下，如果你试过，它对打钉子很糟糕。但它对报时很棒。

所以问题是，它是一块好手表还是一块坏手表？这完全取决于它是为什么而建造的，它是为了什么？一旦你开始说，这是一个好人吗？

这是一个好人吗？除非你问，人是为了什么而存在的，否则你无法回答那个问题。他们意味着什么？

人类生命的意义是什么？我们在这里是为了什么？什么是重要的东西？

你无法从科学中回答那个问题。你不能。有一个印度教的答案，有一个佛教的答案，有一个个人主义启蒙的答案，有一个世俗的答案，有一个基督教的答案，有一个犹太人的答案，任何说这是好行为、这是坏行为的人，都将其嵌入在特定的世界观、一套信仰假设中。

没有任何人可以，如果你在任何公共环境中这样说，没有人再知道如何获得视野了。因为启蒙运动关于某种客观的、中立的、来自无处的观点的想法已经消失了，每个人都反对理解这一点。因此，作为基督徒，我们必须有办法，即使在公共教育中，说，这是基督教的方式，这是犹太人的方式，这是印度教的方式，并与我们的学生讨论它。

基督教，每当它被比较时，总是看起来相当不错。它有很多伟大的实践者，比如马丁·路德·金，例如，如果允许你让他成为他真正的样子，那就是福音的牧师。而且有，我们有非常多真正伟大的例子，我发现在某种程度上，如果你在一个更福音派的教会，在那里你总是与非基督徒一起工作，你总是对此如此兴奋，但你想，我希望我在一个没有那么多流动性的教会，而且有，人们年复一年地在那里，我可以致力于门徒训练。

换句话说，我曾在一些教会，我在弗吉尼亚州有一个教会，那里没有人离开，也没有人来，我有很多，我能够做很多门徒训练和深入的神学教育，但我，我有传福音和外展的热情。我认为如果你在公共教育，或者如果你在基督教教育，你会发现，一般来说，你会完成不同的事情。你会发现一个能让你更多地谈论、接触人的，但你总是觉得，我的手在某种程度上被束缚了，我不能完全走到我想去的地方，而在基督教教育中，有时你觉得它有点像温室。

所以我只是不知道哪一个是理想的，我认为我们必须两者都有，任何给人印象说每个人都从公立学校出来并想要基督教学校的人，那将是错误的。因为我今年在做箴言这件事，我现在可能理解学校的目标应该是什么，应该是智慧，这是帮助孩子们理解生活如何运作，人心如何运作，这样他们就知道如何做出正确的选择，即使在道德规则不适用的领域，那将是，我认为有趣的是，这可能是对既是基督徒的公立学校教师和基督教学校教师都可以尝试做的事情，他们会有点不同地走。话虽如此，斯科特，你想问你的问题吗？

实际上，我想，谢谢。既然学校还没有读书，而且据我了解，他们仍然对信仰怀有敌意，为什么父母应该把他们的孩子交给一个如此敌对的学校系统，尤其是考虑到即使孩子在基督教家庭中长大，知道福音，也许，或者被接受的基督，他们的信仰仍在形成，它还没有恢复力，他们不能独立站立。为什么父母会把他们的孩子交给这样一个机构，而他们消除那种灌输的机会仍然有限？

我认为那是，既然我不相信中立性，我不相信有这样的东西，正如我刚才所说，因此我对把我的孩子送进基督教学校的想法有很多同情，我在基督教学校的孩子从中受益，这样说吧。我在纽约发现，真正反基督教的学校是私立学校。换句话说，巴克利和查平，而不是布朗克斯科学或斯蒂文森特。

我认为公平地对待非基督教学校，我们需要做出这种区分。我看到了巨大的差异，现在我发现郊区的公立学校经常，他们在想，你要么有世俗的人，要么有基督教的人，这些疯狂的疯子基督徒。在城市里，公立学校的教师正在与印度教徒、穆斯林、佛教徒、犹太人和基督徒以及东正教基督徒和天主教基督徒打交道，我发现他们非常小心，难以置信地尊重。

例如，每年，在罗斯福岛小学，我被要求与一位拉比和一位牧师一起进来，我们进来，我们谈论圣日，因为那位公立学校的犹太教师教我所有的孩子都经历过，只是说，看，我真的希望他们理解这些不同的观点，她说，我甚至试图确保我不让他们认为我相信它们都是相对的。即使她是世俗的，但她说，我意识到在某种意义上，她理解如果我只是说，嗯，有这个观点和这个观点，这不是很美妙吗？每个人都有自己的宗教，它们都同样有效。

即使这样说实际上也是一种极权主义观点。就是这样。即使她永远无法说那是启蒙观点，她在某种程度上理解那是在把世俗主义置于其他宗教之上。

我认为在某种程度上，她很害怕，她害怕一些愤怒的印度教或穆斯林或基督教家长进来尖叫。我想在纽约，每个人都尖叫，所以我发现公立学校极其尊重不同的宗教，并不那么敌对。而且似乎甚至有一种直觉理解，即使是世俗主义也不能被灌输给这些孩子，否则他们的父母会取下他们老师的头。

我想让你知道，当谈到城市中一些所谓的精英私立学校时，很多人想把他们的孩子送到那里，他们公开地怀有敌意。我不是在开玩笑。他们乐于拆除任何传统的权威或道德理解。

因此我认为你应该做出区分。这是第一件事。其次，我很高兴我的孩子，我认为那两个既上公立学校又上基督教学校的可能受益了。

我认为如果他们一直在基督教学校或一直在公立学校，我看到了一些优势。所以我不知道那告诉你什么，我只是一个优柔寡断的查理·布朗式的人。但我认为你确实必须非常仔细地观察，因为我认为斯科特的问题是对的。

如果你是，我在和父母交谈，我会说你真的需要知道你的学区或你当地的学校有多敌对或什么样，或者你的，老师的观点是什么样的，因为你真的没有权利抛弃我。圣经，申命记第6章说，父母，你们要负责孩子的成长。而当我不能把那个委托出去时，我的意思是我可以把教学的实际日复一日的工作委托给别人，但我不能把责任委托出去。

据估计，我们大多数人在工作上花费了一半的醒着时间。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作联系起来，我们的职业如何更具情感？

在他的书《每一个好的努力》中，提摩太·凯勒从几十年的职业和呼召教导中汲取经验，向你展示如何在为上帝和他人服务时在工作中找到真正的快乐。这本书对基督教对工作的视角如何成为蓬勃发展的职业和平衡的个人生活的基础提供了令人惊讶的见解。每一个好的努力是我们对你的感谢，因为你的礼物帮助福音与生活与世界各地更多的人分享基督的爱。

## 信仰、世界观与课堂 / Faith, Worldview, and the Classroom

One of the things I've noticed in reading New York Times magazine recently, I'm sure Tony being a journalist has noticed this, that increasingly when reporters are doing when they're writing articles about hot topics, instead of acting like they're the all-knowing objective omnipotent omnipresent narrator, they are making disclaimer of what where their own position is. It was interesting this article on faith in the marketplace, it was in the cover story of New York Times magazine last Sunday. The report did a great job and he came out and said in full disclosure disclaimer, here's my view.

This is my religious view. Nevertheless, I'm going to say this, I'm going to try to really be fair-minded and recognize the advantages over here. And I think that's increasingly possible.

You have to, I know that there would be certain, you have to watch out with certain teachers and certain other parents. So I would be very careful, but I bet you increasingly, if you say, well, this is where I'm coming from, we're all coming from someplace and I just want in the interest of full disclosure that you know that this is my viewpoint, but I really can appreciate yours. Now, I think that therefore is possible.

I don't think even 10 years ago you could have done that, but I think increasingly people are going to recognize that we're all embedded in moral communities, we're all embedded in faith communities, that even the secular people is a kind of faith. What's important is not do you make truth claims, but how do you treat people who have different views? And I think that you have to say, it's not a question of whether I believe this or it's how I treat the others, and I want to show that I really respect and I also want you to help me understand your viewpoint and maybe this will change some of the ways in which I see things.

So I think you can be more open. But I'm afraid of, be careful, you know, don't say, oh Tim Keller said, and then you go back and you next time you have a parent interview, you said, by the way, I'm a born again Christian. But it needs to be relevant to the subject.

You don't just say, I want you to know, Tim, my pastor told me, I can do this, it needs to be relevant to the subject, but if it is relevant to say something about it, it's not bad. Somebody else. I do a lot of polling and religious issues during the campaign, and there was a sort of a disinterest actually among certain esteemed journalistic organs here in the city until about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, my mailbox was flooded with co-house.

And all we had been, the sort of turned on a dying impologies, I'm sorry, we didn't publish anything, you wrote, but now we will never think, but so you do get changes, but I do, the one weakness is that if we're in such a position is that in graduate and undergraduate education for teachers, we don't actually provide too many tools for believers to be able to work out their faith in an intelligent way into their teaching and in their educational philosophy. So put on your hat, you're asked to come to Teachers College at Columbia and to give me some advice of changing the design so that you can enhance the educational experience and of believers who are increasingly appearing at our gates. You know, I think it's fair to be as suspicious as I think you are about motives here.

My, you know Rick Lens, you know who he is, teach the Gordon Conwell, he told, I think he's probably right about this, he says, because in secular society politics is everything, because power is everything. Right now, suddenly everybody seems to think, oh, religion is important for getting elected. So we have, I think Catherine told me this just this week, says there's an awful lot of people are suddenly going to say, we got to figure this out, we got it, we got to figure this out, we got to understand this, this phenomenon, religion, and especially orthodox religion, we got to figure it out, figure out what makes it tick, maybe learn how to dismantle it, maybe weaken it or maybe use it somehow, figure out a way to, and you know, if somebody comes and says, we want to do a story because we understand you're a Christian school teacher, and we want to, we're doing a story on Christians who are in the public school, be careful about all of that for a while, because I'm afraid I don't want to just be a specimen, that people certainly, I guess maybe all, I guess we are anyway, but I would be careful about, I'd be careful about what the motivation is, I want to use you to show us how to market to evangelical Christians.

So let's say they're serious and they say, you know, we're not really, you know, a lot of our students complain or say that they don't really get, really intellectually developed, because they're inside of them is never done, so what would you suggest? Yeah, I think I probably would, there's a new book by, you know, what I do, there's a new book by Nicholas Woolworth's store called Educating for Shalom, even though it's mainly about, he's taught a Yale for years, he just retired, strong Christian guy, Dutch Calvinist kind of Kaipirian theologian, and he's written, it's actually a bunch of essays on, it's mainly Christian education, but he would say for example, Tony, there's the old myth of the universal that I'm just the human being, you know, I'm not coming from any particular perspective, I'm just telling you the facts, he says there's a, there's a solid, cystic kind of particularism where it just says, I have the truth and you don't, I have the Bible and you're, you're the only, and then he calls what he calls accessible particularism, which is to say, let's all get out, let's get out on the table, the fact that I, what we're saying is embedded in various faith narratives and let's talk about it and let's try to learn from one another and let me, let me, let me, therefore let me actually give you my Christian approach to economics, brothers and sisters, have you got questions on the education reform? I'd say question for everybody else, but here, would you like to encourage everyone, the space that's being created, if anyone has read Thomas Urgeo-Vani, I urge you to look him up, because the interesting, the tension that's going on in the system as well, there's this instruction, instruction, instruction, focus, Thomas Urgeo-Vani is one of the most revered people in the field of education and the board of education pays him to come here, so when he comes to talk, I was sitting next to an orthodox Jewish colleague of mine and we listened to his entire speech, which was all of the top brass of the DOE and it was so funny that everything he outlined was completely about faith-based communities, but talking about how this is really the way schools as organizations should be, so, but every, oh, that's wonderful.

He knows just enough scriptures to put in, actually, in his writing, he does reference scripture, and so I'm just, I guess I'm curious because with school reform, what's happening and a lot of the criticism of the academy and things that the chancellor is doing is that they're trying to take business strategies and just dump it on top of education, so I guess, and Sergei Ivani was making the claim that schools are more akin to churches and social organizations, so I guess my question is, what are some of the elements of church life and other social organizations that we can use to help perform schools as opposed to what's happening now, which is, you know, if it works in business, the whole Jack Welch just, you know, drop it on education. Well, you know, I, you were right in picking up, because I started answering a question just a second ago. Is that, well, I'm not an educator, I don't know what all the tensions are.

I understand why we have a little bit of this problem in the church, for example, when we examine ministers who are coming in who want to be ordained ministers, the easiest way to do it is we give this, we give them an enormously, we do this, we're presbyterians. So, you know, you have to master this much doctrine, and we give these very detailed exams on doctrine, but what you really want to assess is, do they know how to, what's their bedside manner like? Do they know how to inspire people to want to believe in God and to know Christ and that's not quantifiable?

It's not quantifiable easily. It's much harder to find out whether this is a person who really can be a gospel minister like that. I want to, the way I can just systematically just create a, you know, kind of a production assembly line is tests and scores, and, you know, you got this score on theology, this score on Bible, this score on church history, this score on this, and hey, they got 97.

Again, we all know, of course, that you can get 97% on all the scores and be a terrible minister, as you all know. So how do you assess it, unfortunately, as soon as you're talking about character and wisdom, I don't know how to do it, other than to say, you have to, you have to create communities who evaluate people communally, you know, you have, it's not actually not that hard to see of a kid is doing better in school, is showing an interest in learning, is relating well to his classmates, I don't know, can you quantify that a little bit, usually the grades go up, yeah, you can quantify that, somebody is it completely quantifiable, is it, maybe, no, it's probably not, so I think probably what you have to do is you have to, I don't know how this works, but you have to try to argue for letting the schools do not be quite as test score oriented, that's all I can tell you, I, and that's not the movement, is it, the movement's all in the other direction. Well, it's kind of what I'm saying is that they state they're speaking both ways, because it's instruction, instruction, that the money is, you know, spent to bring in people like Sergi Avani, who are giving exactly the opposite message, who says that, you know, kids create social capital outside, if you don't allow them to create it in their schools, then they'll create it on their own, and that's why we have the problems, we have a school of violence, which you know is, you know, driving a lot of the conversation in the city with the impact schools, police officers in schools, so it's kind of, you know, but people that, it's kind of as if we'll be quiet about that, they know where it's working, and I've had conversations with teachers in here, I see some people out here where their classrooms work in the middle of absolute chaos, and the reason is because of what we're talking about, but you're told, well, it's really about the work, so there's kind of this unspoken, so it's, I guess part of the question too, is how much do you reference the real reason for it, because my school is turning around, why I have five rules, one of them is treat others the way you want to be treated, I understand that's not addressing long-term things that I can't do as a parent, that it's at least establishing, you understand so, but it's all just as if, keep in the golden rule, you're making it, you're making explicit, and you're basically judging the kids on the golden rule, but that's not something to be tested.

Right, yeah. But it ultimately impacts test scores, like, you know, how much do you say, because the classrooms that are working, when they ask why, and they find out, it's typically a teacher who's using that philosophy, it's not about the instructional approach that they're using, so how far do you go and engaging people in that? Well, as far as you can, because don't you think, in some case, your superior will just take your head off, if you're in other places, it won't, try to put yourself in a place where you think that there's, as you know, the public, it's like a swimming pool, your public school system has got hot spots and cold spots, try to get into a hot spot, and push what you know is the right way.

Take questions, right? Okay. I have one.

Oh, we have another one. I'm sorry. Yes.

As a Christian administrator, what do you see all roles in terms of how we lead our schools and as part of a community? You know, many schools, people go in and they come out of the Dan, there's no interaction with the community, and I think we have a responsibility, and more so as Christian educate and administrators, and so what do you see all roles? Yeah.

You're right. It's your job to convince the people of that. Here's a suggestion of a book.

I guess in the end it looks pretty pessimistic, but I got a lot out of it. A friend of mine wrote a book called The Death of Character by James Hunter, and it's actually about moral education. And his basic point, which is kind of hard to argue with, maybe you could get some stuff out of the book to use on your teachers, is to say communities create character.

He says case studies don't do it. He says communities create character where the kids see certain behavior models, and they see people saying something of the same thing. If the teachers don't talk to each other, each one of you is an independent operator, just an entrepreneur, you're not a community at all.

And the point is the character is formed by the community. It's not, you can't be formed in a classroom. You can't, you know, you give great case studies.

Here's justice. Here's equity. Here's love.

Here's patience. But unless they see equity and love and patience modeled for them, they're not going to learn it. And they have to see it affirmed and reinforced that way.

So if your teachers don't believe it, to the degree, your teachers believe it, and to the degree you make it a community, to that degree will be an effective school. I know it's a big fight. You want to have people ask questions?

我最近在阅读《纽约时报杂志》时注意到的一件事，我确信托尼作为记者也注意到了这一点，越来越多的记者在写关于热门话题的文章时，而不是表现得像他们是无所不知的客观、全能、无所不在的叙述者，他们正在对他们自己的立场在哪里做出免责声明。有趣的是这篇关于市场中信仰的文章，它是上周日《纽约时报杂志》的封面故事。记者做得很好，他出来说，完全披露免责声明，这是我的观点。

这是我的宗教观点。尽管如此，我会说这个，我会尝试真正公正，并认识到这里的优势。我认为这越来越可能。

你必须，我知道会有某些，你必须注意某些教师和某些其他家长。所以我会非常小心，但我敢打赌越来越多，如果你说，嗯，这是我来自的地方，我们都来自某个地方，我只是希望在完全披露的利益中，你知道这是我的观点，但我真的可以欣赏你的。现在，我认为因此这是可能的。

我认为即使十年前你也做不到，但我认为越来越多的人会认识到我们都嵌入在道德社区中，我们都嵌入在信仰社区中，即使是世俗的人也是一种信仰。重要的不是你是否提出真理主张，而是你如何对待有不同观点的人？我认为你必须说，这不是我相信这个还是我如何对待他人的问题，我想表明我真的尊重，我也希望你帮助我理解你的观点，也许这会改变我看待事物的一些方式。

所以我认为你可以更加开放。但我害怕，小心，你知道，不要说，哦，蒂姆·凯勒说，然后你回去，下次你进行家长面谈时，你说，顺便说一下，我是一个重生的基督徒。但它需要与主题相关。

你不只是说，我想让你知道，蒂姆，我的牧师告诉我，我可以做这个，它需要与主题相关，但如果说一些关于它的话是相关的，那也不坏。其他人。我在竞选期间做了很多关于宗教问题的民意调查，实际上在城市里某些受尊敬的新闻机构中有一种冷漠，直到星期二晚上大约7点，我的邮箱充满了共同房屋。

我们一直在做的，那种在垂死的道歉上，对不起，我们没有发表任何东西，你写了，但现在我们永远不会想，但现在我们会，但你确实得到了改变，但我认为，一个弱点是，如果我们处于这样的位置，那就是在教师的研究生和本科教育中，我们实际上没有为信徒提供太多工具，使他们能够以一种智慧的方式将他们的信仰融入他们的教学和教育哲学中。所以戴上你的帽子，你被要求来到哥伦比亚大学师范学院，给我一些改变设计的建议，以便你可以增强越来越多出现在我们门口的信徒的教育经验。你知道，我认为对这里的动机持怀疑态度是公平的。

我的，你知道瑞克·伦斯，你知道他是谁，在戈登康威尔教书，他告诉，我认为他关于这个可能是对的，他说，因为在世俗社会中政治就是一切，因为权力就是一切。现在，突然每个人似乎都认为，哦，宗教对当选很重要。所以我们有，我认为凯瑟琳本周告诉我这个，说有很多人突然会说，我们必须弄清楚这个，我们必须，我们必须弄清楚这个，我们必须理解这个，这种现象，宗教，尤其是正统宗教，我们必须弄清楚它，弄清楚是什么让它运作，也许学习如何拆除它，也许削弱它或者也许以某种方式使用它，想办法，你知道，如果有人来说，我们想做一个故事，因为我们了解你是一位基督教学校教师，我们想，我们正在做一个关于公立学校中基督徒的故事，对所有这些要小心一段时间，因为我担心我不想只是一个标本，那些人当然，我想也许所有，我想我们无论如何都是，但我会小心，我会小心动机是什么，我想用你来向我们展示如何向福音派基督徒推销。

所以假设他们是认真的，他们说，你知道，我们不是真的，你知道，我们的很多学生抱怨或说他们真的没有，真的在智力上发展，因为他们内心的从来没有完成，所以你会建议什么？是的，我想我可能会，你知道，我做什么，尼古拉斯·沃尔特斯托夫有一本新书叫《为沙洛姆而教育》，尽管它主要是关于，他在耶鲁教了很多年，他刚刚退休，强大的基督徒，荷兰加尔文主义者，凯伯式的神学家，他写了，它实际上是一堆关于，主要是基督教教育的文章，但他会说，例如，托尼，有普遍的旧神话，我只是人类，你知道，我不是来自任何特定的视角，我只是告诉你事实，他说有一个，有一个坚实的、囊性的特殊主义，它只是说，我有真理，你没有，我有圣经，你是，你是唯一的，然后他称之为可获得的特殊主义，也就是说，让我们都出来，让我们把事实摆在桌面上，我，我们所说的嵌入在各种信仰叙事中，让我们谈论它，让我们尝试互相学习，让我，让我，让我，因此让我实际上给你我的基督教经济学方法，兄弟姐妹们，你们对教育改革有问题吗？我会对其他人说问题，但在这里，你愿意鼓励每个人吗，正在创建的空间，如果有人读过托马斯·瑟乔瓦尼，我敦促你查找他，因为有趣的是，系统中正在发生的紧张关系，也有这种指导、指导、指导，重点，托马斯·瑟乔瓦尼是教育领域最受尊敬的人之一，教育委员会付钱让他来这里，所以当他来演讲时，我坐在我的一位东正教犹太同事旁边，我们听了他的整个演讲，那是所有教育部的高层，很有趣的是，他概述的一切完全都是关于基于信仰的社区，但谈论这真的是学校作为组织应该的方式，所以，但每个，哦，那太棒了。

他知道足够的经文来放入，实际上，在他的写作中，他确实引用了经文，所以我只是，我想我很好奇，因为随着学校改革，正在发生的事情以及对学院和校长正在做的事情的很多批评是他们试图采取商业策略并把它倾倒在教育之上，所以我想，而瑟乔瓦尼正在提出主张，学校更类似于教会和社会组织，所以我想我的问题是，我们可以使用教会生活和其他社会组织的一些什么元素来帮助执行学校，而不是现在正在发生的，你知道，如果它在商业中有效，整个杰克·韦尔奇只是，你知道，把它放在教育上。嗯，你知道，我，你在挑选时是对的，因为我刚才开始回答一个问题。那是，嗯，我不是教育者，我不知道所有的紧张关系是什么。

我理解为什么我们在教会中有一点这个问题，例如，当我们检查想要成为受按立牧师的牧师时，最简单的方法是我们给这个，我们给他们一个巨大的，我们做这个，我们是长老会。所以，你知道，你必须掌握这么多教义，我们对教义进行这些非常详细的考试，但你真正想要评估的是，他们知道如何，他们的床边态度是什么样的？他们知道如何激励人们想要相信上帝并认识基督吗，那是不可量化的吗？

它不容易量化。要找出这是否是一个真正可以成为那样的福音牧师的人要困难得多。我想要，我能系统地创建一个，你知道，某种生产流水线的方式是测试和分数，而且，你知道，你在神学上得了这个分数，在圣经上得了这个分数，在教会历史上得了这个分数，在这个上得了这个分数，嘿，他们得了97分。

再次，我们都知道，当然，你可以在所有分数上得97%，但却是一个糟糕的牧师，你们都知道。所以如何评估它，不幸的是，一旦你在谈论品格和智慧，我不知道怎么做，除了说，你必须，你必须创建社区来集体评估人，你知道，你有，看一个孩子在学校做得更好，对学习表现出兴趣，与他的同学相处得很好，这实际上不难，我不知道，你能稍微量化一下吗，通常成绩会上升，是的，你可以量化，有人是完全可量化的吗，是吗，也许，不，它可能不是，所以我认为可能你必须做的是你必须，我不知道这是如何工作的，但你必须尝试争辩让学校不要那么以考试分数为导向，这就是我能告诉你的一切，我，那不是运动，是吗，运动都朝着另一个方向。嗯，这有点像我在说的是，他们说他们在两边都说话，因为这是指导，指导，钱是，你知道，花在引进像瑟乔瓦尼这样的人，他们给出完全相反的信息，他说，你知道，孩子们在外面创造社会资本，如果你不允许他们在学校中创造它，那么他们会自己创造，这就是为什么我们有问题，我们有学校暴力问题，你知道这正在推动城市中很多对话，与影响学校、学校中的警察，所以这有点，你知道，但人们认为，这有点好像我们会对此保持安静，他们知道它在哪里起作用，我与这里的老师进行了对话，我在这里看到一些人，他们的教室在绝对混乱的中间工作，原因是因为我们正在谈论的，但你被告知，嗯，这真的是关于工作，所以有一种这种不言而喻的，所以这是，我想问题的一部分也是，你在多大程度上参考它的真正原因，因为我的学校正在好转，为什么我有五条规则，其中之一是以你想要被对待的方式对待他人，我理解那不是在解决我不能作为父母做的长期事情，它至少在建立，你理解所以，但它都只是好像，保持黄金法则，你在使它，你在使它明确，你基本上是在用黄金法则来判断孩子，但那不是要测试的东西。

对。但它最终影响考试分数，就像，你知道，你说了多少，因为正在工作的教室，当他们问为什么，他们发现，通常是一个使用那种哲学的教师，这不是关于他们使用的教学方法，所以你走多远并让人们参与其中？嗯，尽你所能，因为你不认为，在某些情况下，如果你在其他地方，你的上级会取下你的头，它不会，试着把自己放在一个你认为有的地方，你知道，公立的，它就像一个游泳池，你的公立学校系统有热点和冷点，试着进入一个热点，推动你知道是正确方式的。

提问，对吗？好的。我有一个。

哦，我们还有一个。对不起。是的。

作为一名基督徒管理者，你如何看待我们在如何领导我们的学校以及作为社区一部分方面的所有角色？你知道，许多学校，人们进去，他们从丹出来，与社区没有互动，我认为我们有责任，作为基督教教育者和管理者更是如此，所以你如何看待所有角色？是的。

你是对的。说服人们相信这一点是你的工作。这是一本书的建议。

我想最终它看起来相当悲观，但我从中得到了很多。我的一个朋友写了一本书叫《品格之死》，作者是詹姆斯·亨特，它实际上是关于道德教育的。他的基本观点，这有点难以争辩，也许你可以从这本书中得到一些东西用在你的老师身上，是说社区创造品格。

他说案例研究做不到。他说社区创造品格，孩子们在那里看到某些行为模式，他们看到人们说同样的事情。如果老师们彼此不交谈，你们每个人都是一个独立的运营者，只是一个企业家，你根本不是一个社区。

重点是品格是由社区形成的。它不是，你不能在教室里形成。你不能，你知道，你给出很棒的案例研究。

这是正义。这是公平。这是爱。

这是耐心。但除非他们看到公平、爱和耐心被为他们建模，否则他们不会学习它。他们必须看到它以那种方式被肯定和强化。

所以如果你的老师不相信它，在某种程度上，你的老师相信它，在某种程度上你使它成为一个社区，在那种程度上将是一所有效的学校。我知道这是一场大战。你想让人们提问吗？

## 在教学中维持信仰和智慧 / Sustaining Faith and Wisdom in Teaching

I teach high school in the South Bronx, and luckily everyone in the Bronx knows they need God, so, or something, so they let me pray for their kids. I don't really have an issue. I teach in public school.

But what do you do when you rejuvenate yourself? Because as a teacher already, I feel like, and you are a teacher, I mean, you come back with your, right? And you're real strong.

I'm a teacher. Right. Okay.

Good. Thank you. An educator, really.

Like as an educator, you take this sabbatical, right? You take this time in the summer, and I want to know, what do you, what parts of you do, you feel depleted after doing this for many years, because it's finally my second year. And what parts do you know God needs to work in you?

Because I feel like this summer, I taught again, I didn't take time off, but I'm feeling kind of, you know, I'm saying worn down, so what do you do, and have you come about after a number of years? Yeah. Okay.

Well, I have to, as you prop, some of you, if you're counting, I actually take two months away from preaching. And what I'm doing for one of those months is I'm actually writing, I decided to try to pull together a book each year, or if I, I'm not saying I can write a book every year, but I'm trying, I'm trying to write a book, trying to work on a book for one month. One of the advantages of that is it's, it's actually fairly hard work, but it's not out with people, it's, it's more research, and I usually get terrific amount of ideas for my sermons from working on the book.

The second thing I do is for one month, I take a whole month off as vacation, but during that month, I, I probably triple my amount of prayer, like I try to do two or three hours a day. It sounds like, wow, what a spirit to go, wow, I mean, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading the Bible and it's not like I'm just sitting there looking, looking at, I don't look at the clouds for three hours, I, you know, I use the book of common prayer and I, you know, you know, read meditative letters and sermons and study the Bible and pray. And I actually, the other thing is, I've got a, probably about 12 people, I don't mean people, really, like couples, people that I've known for many, many years, are people that I, that I can relax with, people that I can, can find in, people that I can share with, what, what I'm facing, and I make sure I get around to them.

Actually, I try to take vacations with them if I possibly can. So it's a, it's a, it's a whole month of very intensive people, time and prayer time. And one month of very, actually, fairly intensive, actually, what I like about the week, the year, what's left month, the month of working on a book is I actually have more time to work than I can, working on my sermons for the rest of the year because I, you know, I have so much time every week because I'm busy, I'm out, I'm doing stuff like this.

So it's, it's really, like, really in the ivory tower for a month. And then really out with people and praying for a month. But a change is as good as a rest, by the way, but you do, if I was just preaching, which I, I used to, I used to, I, what I used to do is I used to go on vacation and people said, oh, when you're in the, in the memory, would you please preach down here?

And I used to do that. And that was not a good idea. You have to let the land, live, follow for a while, otherwise you, it, it pleats and eventually you can't get any more crumbs out of it.

Okay, that's a little bit. Yes, go ahead. Good evening, bless you, hi, everybody.

I've always worked in underserved schools. I started out working in East New York and then I transferred to the South Bronx. And I did what was called integration transfer, schools that need to be diversified.

Well, this September was my first time going to District 2 in Virginia, now I'm just a 21st and 1st Street, some majority Caucasian and Asian students, there are some Hispanics and blacks there. But at the other schools, the underserved schools, you had the freedom to teach what you wanted to teach and use the books you wanted to use. And at this school, everything's very regimented, we have to teach, free the mighty of Mice and Men.

And I'm having a hard time with some of the literature, because, you know, of Mice and Men there's a lot of expertise in it, and I don't want to meet a lot of the books in class. I want some suggestions. No, are you saying, are you saying you would like some help with, you know, how to, how to teach it or you just don't know, you have to read certain books and certain books.

You have to read it out loud. I'm comfortable, yes, I'm not comfortable with saying certain, where are the certain books? Well, I know it's like, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's, I know it's like, it sounds like a sort of a pastor should answer, but I, I'll go out and say, it seems to me that when you're doing it as a teacher, I mean, the, the, the Christian actors have asked me something similar and only as worse.

What they say is, okay, I'm a Christian and here I am being called to act and say something that I, you know, I use exploatives or actually act in a certain way that I don't really agree with them. I said, well, if you read the Bible, there's a lot of horrible things in the Bible. If there's places in the Bible that talk about some pretty bad things, in fact, there's a lot of, a lot of the, sometimes you know this because I say this in the, in the services, the translation sometimes kind of, purify what the Hebrew and the Greek actually are saying.

It's telling you the story about how bad things really are. People really talk like this. People really do these awful things.

It's not, you don't want to have to even look at that, but the purpose of the literature is to bring it out. And so I would say that there's nothing wrong with you saying it out loud because in a certain sense, you're an actor when you're reading it. You're taking the role.

It's not who you really are. You're getting the book across to the kids. They certainly have heard the exploatives.

They live in New York City. But I'm always telling them, you know, I don't swear at them in this case. Yeah.

You're right. No, no, no. Yeah.

I think I ought to just say this. I'm doing this for the book, but I don't want to hear anybody talking like this in my hearing and I don't talk like this. Okay.

Yeah. Okay. On a different note, I'd like to ask you something about exhaustion, just to follow on from what you were saying.

I have a very good summer and I'm totally relaxed and I'm enthusiastic to start the year and after a week. It's already, I feel like I'm too tired to do anything and I think one of the difficulties with teaching is you never get to an end point. There's never a point where you feel, okay, I've done everything I need to do and that's it and that I can switch off.

And the marking keeps coming but it's not even that it's the going through lessons in my mind and continually not being able to switch off the job and the weekend comes along and the entire, you know, Sunday is spent doing marking and preparing. So when, for example, the services changed from the 930 to the 1030, I was annoyed because it meant I got home later and couldn't do as much schoolwork, but I mean, it seems like I can't get this under control and I've been teaching for 15 years and every year I, you know, say to myself, I'm going to achieve a balance and it never happens. So I'm just...

What time do you get home? Do you work at night? I'm at school at about quarter to seven every morning and I get home at about seven o'clock in the evenings.

And then the weekends as well. Do you work on things at night? No.

Yeah. Think about this. I was a...

I've always been... I've always tend to overwork and I've always worked probably about 75, 80 hours a week, all my life as a minister and yet here's... If you think of your...

You have seven days unless you think of morning afternoon and evening and admittedly if your evening starts at seven, it's a little bit of... I mean, that's all right. You still have three hours or so of rooms.

So you have morning... So you have 21 segments, right? Seven days, three times?

I wasn't a math major. Math teachers is seven times three times one? Okay.

You have 21 segments. Make sure that you take seven of them off under all circumstances that you're not teaching and you're not working on lessons seven. Then I have been able to do that.

I have to take one day a week off, two days, there's three. And that means somewhere I have to take one afternoon and one afternoon off and three other evenings off because I'm out evenings, I work evenings sometimes. If you can take off seven, you can survive.

I have for quite a long time in my kids, for some strange reason, do not remember me being an absentee father, which is still something I don't know how I dodge that bullet. Caddies is where you take those seven if you've got kids. Just make sure and sabbath yourself and also everything is do some reading that has nothing to do with your job and make sure be disciplined about that and say I'm going to have at least two or three hours a week reading.

Maybe even every night, an hour, some book that you're working through that has nothing to do with your job always makes you feel like you've got more of a life. Just a couple ideas. Seven out of 21.

Yeah, Rebecca. I actually tell my teachers to go home and I go home and because the thing, this reference is what we were talking about to be fresh and to have ideas for them and to be emotionally rested, that's what they're getting in my opinion more out of than the actual lessons that you're preparing. So you might not even recognize how you're not able to interact in the situations when they're high pressure.

So you just have to step out and you are not your job. I say that to my teachers, you are Hillary, you are a teacher that you don't become your job especially as a Christian that's, you have an easier way to ground yourself and say this is where it ends. And if you get less than thoughts, I know that happens all the time, you know, get up and write them down and then leave it because it's just not sustainable.

And I think you have to remember ultimately what they are getting is the spirit that you're bringing to it. And if you're exhausted and you're not replenishing yourself with what's great for you, the jam or whatever it is, then it's going to show. Anybody else here want to say something about it?

You just do not work in the summits. And okay, what your finances are, do not work in the summits. Katherine, can we still take a question or two?

Yeah, go ahead. I was a teaching fellow and for the, that the two years and I was teaching fellow, I felt like it was a race and I got to my second year and I said, I'm done, I'm going to leave my school and go for somewhere a little bigger and better. But it was actually, I teach in the Bronx and it's actually the parents that convinced me to stay at my school.

And you know, for all the great reasons. So with that said, Rebecca, you know, used that something about the golden rule, teaching the golden rule. I have 26 kindergartners in my Bronx classroom and all we do is teach the golden rule to them about being loved one another, be kind to one another.

But what do you do when these kids go home to these parents who obviously are not communicative with their teachers who teach the extreme opposite? Because we do really well in the classroom. There's no violence in the classroom.

But out on the playground, why did you hit that kid? Because my mommy told me that if somebody hits me, I hit him back. So this is something that goes beyond the classroom, beyond your role as a teacher.

And how do you address this? You can't go to a parent and say, you got to practice the golden rule. So what is a practical approach to these parents?

Teachers. I run parenting workshops. One of the things we did in October 2nd, and Janet was at the piece, what we did was, we invited parents with a community-based organization, once convention, and we did a drama workshop, a dance workshop, and a drawing of media workshop.

And we did it as a family day, where we called out time with the families we invited the children with the parents to our school. I think it's an administrative capacity, that you need to go to your administrator and ask them to think creatively about not having a parent meeting where you're sitting. In fact, one of the parents said it was at the meeting at the end.

We debriefed, and they said to me, this is so refreshing, whenever I went to a parent meeting before, all the administrator did was bark pieces at me, you know? And my deal is like, I'm not interested in doing things like barking at people. I want them to sit down and actually do activities with their children, and we invited staff to also do those activities, but I think you need to go to your administrator and say, I'm having an issue here.

Can we brainstorm ways of solving that? I think you need to do that holistically at different times throughout your community. We have a difficult population in my place.

I'm with who have parents who have a lot of the same issues you're saying, and then high school. By the way, you can do that as a principal, though, because she couldn't do it as a teacher. She could go to a principal.

Okay. Yes, the question. But, I mean, my principal does that.

We do Saturday workshops, family workshops, but these parents don't come. They don't come to them. They don't come to parent-teacher conferences.

They don't come when you call them, they don't pick up the phone. And, you know, I want to stay and I want to do this, and I want to work with these parents who are absent in their kids' school lives. So what can I do as a teacher to go out there and talk to these parents?

What, one of the things that worked, and this is the story of my life, I've been in four hours of meetings today trying to explain some of the same things. And if you're just very, if you explain it logically, which is, I understand that on the street, because this is exactly what, I mean, my kids get jumped, they're afraid to confess who's doing what? Because they get jumped when they leave school.

It's very serious. There's bloods members. I mean, I know it's the same story a lot of us have, but the explanation is school.

When you enter the door of school and the yard is school, that is part of your responsibility. What happens at recess? So I have not had a parent yet that doesn't come to the agreement, and I have, I have had parents write it, put it in writing, I am telling them to hit back just so you know.

But once you have a conversation with them, and you can do this as a teacher, which is, how do I protect your child? If you're telling your child to hit back, and he's telling his child to hit back, and then everyone's hitting, and when I say to them, I don't want to you serve your authority. And they always respect that.

I don't want to you serve your authority, but I can't protect them. What if it's your child the next time whose parents said the same thing? So when they walk inside the school door, we have to operate differently.

And I say to them, I can't tell you what to do on the street. I understand that's a different issue, but inside the school doors, if you could help us by saying to the child, give the teachers and the staff the opportunity, give me the opportunity to keep them safe. Is that what you say?

Yes. Okay. Administrators do, you know, villains, even today I understand there were some situations like that where a parent actually tried to hit another student, and the administrators have to step in and make the parents realize what would you want us to do for your child?

And I think once you bring it home to the parent, that his child could be the next victim, then they do step back and really think a little more rationally. It's a bit logical with the process and the follow-up through, they usually come home. Is there great answers?

Go ahead. Can you hear me? One thing is, you know, it's sort of under the current and all conversations with educators is as your teachers, trying to implement kind of the big picture up above from administration and from for the public school teachers, the DOE, and I've been a teacher, so I understand that, but sort of on the other side of the coin, I'm now with the DOE, and I just wanted to let you all know that it's incredibly encouraging for me to be here tonight.

And for what it's worth, there is somebody at the DOE, praying for you all every day. It's probably hard to leave, but... And I will certainly say I would appreciate and we'd all, well, I would appreciate your prayers as well.

And then my quick question for you all is, when I was a teacher and I both worked as a teacher in the public schools and then worked with the parochial schools in the Bronx and Manhattan, there were a few moments where I just could really send you a message that God was sort of showing me that the way I was interacting with the parent or my attitude in a certain circumstance was totally infused by the grace that he had given me as a Christian and I'm sorry, I'm a little upset. And so my question for you all is maybe if you have a little anecdotal story from your own experiences and educators, if when you just said, like, gosh, I couldn't have handled that unless I had this world view. I'll begin.

We talked about that we prayed, many of us prayed and we said we couldn't start out day without prayer either reading the Bible or even at school or with others because what I got to school each day, it's with a sense of adventure because we never know, you know, you have the best laid plans and everyone is supposed to be in place and then a child falls and gets cut. We had an anecdote, a kindergarten kid fell in the yard and they thought that she had just bumped her chin and when she went to the doctor, she had fractured her jaw and her jaw had to be wired and it was with fear and trembling. How do you speak to that parent when she comes?

What do you say to a parent in that case? How would a parent react? So there was always this prayer and the parent comes in and the administrators there we talked to the parent and then sometimes they come in very hostile, sometimes they have issues and they just need someone to talk to and as we speak to them and asking the Holy Spirit to put the right words and at least in our mouth as we speak, the parents sometimes they become very calm or that parent may just cry or we need just a hug that we have instances of children whose parents are dying and they know they are dying and they have issues of what's going to happen to my child and just a hug and then when that parent leaves and they feel better or the situation is calm and we say thank God, you know, God is so good that we say it all the time because we had no thought or no plan of how we would face that situation so it happens I think almost daily at my school.

Just going back to the parent issue that June brought up a few minutes ago, it just happened actually before I got here and I said I spent a lot of time investigating the game related incident and I actually school safety had to walk out to parents today because they were so enraged over the conversation and I guess to be honest like one of your first tendencies would be while I wasn't able to complete the investigation because you had to be escorted out because of your behavior so maybe I'll just go ahead and record it as this did happen without getting to the bottom of it but I persisted for another rest of the day and I called the parent back on the phone which was really not what I thought I should probably do before coming here and trying to be positive after the way the last meeting went but I told her the status of the investigation and that her son actually had not been one of the parties that had participated in the in the occurrence and she said, Ms. Marlon, I felt so bad all day I just wanted to apologize to you and so I just knew that in that like the fact of just being able to call her back it was not it was just the grace of God just giving me that after it had been you know two or three people walking out and I know that was just totally grace. You're trying to re-weave something that you can tell needs to be related these things need to be related to each other and they're not and it's very very very frustrated but you're Christians and you know what that means that means that you eventually the things you want to see happen are going to happen there will eventually be peace there will eventually be justice there will eventually be whole families there will eventually you won't have parents dying you're going to have a re-woven creation God is going to do it I mean there's a lot of jobs that are more satisfying than your job because you're making something and you make it well and then you send it out there and people buy it you make your money you go home your product are change lives and maturity and wisdom and therefore you're always unhappy with your product I mean it's just never what you want it to be it's very very frustrating but your Christians it's you're not fighting a losing battle at all everything sad is going to come on true someday so you're on the right side and you've got to live in that kind of hope now let's pray Father we thank you that you have called us in this room to be educators and that you've called us into a job that it seems so messy it's not like producing a piece of machinery and it's selling it it's not like so many other jobs in which the product is a quantifiable and the bottom line is so much easier to to grasp and to drive and to recognize we're talking about change lies we're talking about learning wisdom we're talking about maturity we're talking about people becoming real human beings and it seems like an endless maybe losing cause but it's not we know it's not because of Christians and we thank you for all the ways in which the men and women in this room are your agents for healing in the world and repairing and reweaving your creation thank you that the resurrected Jesus proves to us that someday you will completely you will fulfill our deepest desires to see our city hole in this family's hole so thank you for this time and continue to be our great teacher Jesus Christ and his name we pray.

我在南布朗克斯教高中，幸运的是布朗克斯的每个人都知道他们需要上帝，所以，或者某物，所以他们让我为他们的孩子祷告。我真的没有问题。我在公立学校教书。

但当你恢复自己时你会做什么？因为作为一名教师已经，我觉得，你是一名教师，我的意思是，你带着你的，回来，对吧？而且你真的很强壮。

我是一名教师。对。好的。

好的。谢谢。一位教育者，真的。

作为一位教育者，你休这个安息日，对吧？你在夏天休这个时间，我想知道，你做什么，你的哪些部分，在做了很多年之后你感到枯竭，因为这终于是我的第二年。你知道上帝需要在你里面做什么部分工作吗？

因为我觉得这个夏天，我又教书了，我没有休息，但我感觉有点，你知道，我是说疲惫不堪，所以你做什么，在很多年后你是如何来的？是的。好的。

嗯，我必须，正如你支撑，你们中的一些人，如果你在数，我实际上休了两个月不讲道。我在其中一个月做的是我实际上在写作，我决定尝试每年汇集一本书，或者如果我，我不是说我每年可以写一本书，但我在尝试，我在尝试写一本书，尝试在一本书上工作一个月。其中一个优势是它，它实际上是相当艰苦的工作，但它不是与人在一起，它，它更多是研究，我通常从为这本书工作中获得大量的讲道想法。

我做的第二件事是有一个月，我休整整一个月的假期，但在那个月里，我，我可能将我的祷告量增加了三倍，就像我尝试每天做两到三个小时。听起来像，哇，多么属灵去，哇，我的意思是，我在读，你知道，我在读圣经，这不像我只是坐在那里看，看，我不看云三个小时，我，你知道，我使用公祷书，我，你知道，读冥想的信和讲道并研究圣经和祷告。而我实际上，另一件事是，我有，可能大约12个人，我不是说人，真的，像夫妻，我认识很多很多年的人，是我可以放松的人，我可以，可以信任的人，我可以与之分享的人，什么，我正在面对的，我确保我去他们身边。

实际上，如果可能的话，我尝试与他们一起度假。所以这是一个，这是一个，这是一个整整一个月的非常密集的人，时间和祷告时间。还有一个月的非常，实际上，相当密集的，实际上，我喜欢这周的，剩下一个月的，在一本书上工作的月份是我实际上有更多的时间工作比我可以，在一年的其余时间为我的讲道工作，因为我，你知道，我每周有这么多时间，因为我很忙，我出去，我在做这样的事情。

所以它是，它真的是，就像，真的在象牙塔里待一个月。然后真的与人在一起并祷告一个月。但顺便说一下，改变和休息一样好，但你做，如果我只是讲道，我，我过去，我，我过去做的是我过去去度假，人们说，哦，当你在，在记忆中，你愿意在这里讲道吗？

我过去做那个。那不是一个好主意。你必须让土地，让，暂时休耕，否则你，它，它恳求，最终你无法从中得到更多的面包屑。

好的，就是这样一点。是的，请讲。晚上好，祝福你，嗨，大家。

我一直在服务不足的学校工作。我开始在东纽约工作，然后我转到了南布朗克斯。我做了所谓的整合转学，需要多样化的学校。

嗯，今年九月是我第一次去弗吉尼亚州第二区，现在我只是21街和第一街，一些多数白人和亚洲学生，那里有一些西班牙裔和黑人。但在其他学校，服务不足的学校，你有自由教你想教的东西并使用你想使用的书。在这所学校，一切都非常严格，我们必须教，释放强大的《人鼠之间》。

我对一些文学作品有困难，因为，你知道，《人鼠之间》里有很多专业知识，我不想在课堂上遇到很多书。我想要一些建议。不，你是说，你是说你想要一些帮助，你知道，如何，如何教它，还是你只是不知道，你必须读某些书和某些书。

你必须大声读出来。我很舒服，是的，我对说某些，某些书在哪里不舒服？嗯，我知道这就像，我知道这是，我知道这是，我知道这是，我知道这就像，听起来像是牧师应该回答的那种，但我，我会出去说，在我看来，当你作为教师这样做时，我的意思是，这，这，基督教演员问了我类似的事情，只是更糟。

他们说的是，好的，我是一个基督徒，我在这里被要求表演并说一些我，你知道，我使用爆粗口或实际上以我不真正同意他们的某种方式表演。我说，嗯，如果你读圣经，圣经中有很多可怕的事情。圣经中有些地方谈论一些相当糟糕的事情，事实上，有很多，很多，有时你知道这个，因为我在，在礼拜中说这个，翻译有时会净化希伯来语和希腊语实际上在说什么。

它在告诉你关于事情有多糟糕的故事。人们真的这样说话。人们真的做这些可怕的事情。

它不是，你不想不得不甚至看那个，但文学的目的是把它带出来。所以我会说，你大声说出来没有任何问题，因为在某种意义上，当你读它时你是一个演员。你在扮演角色。

那不是你真正的样子。你在向孩子们传达这本书。他们当然听过那些爆粗口。

他们住在纽约市。但我总是告诉他们，你知道，我在这种情况下不对他们咒骂。是的。

你是对的。不，不，不。是的。

我想我应该说这个。我为这本书做这个，但我不想听任何人在我听到的范围内这样说话，我不这样说话。好的。

是的。好的。在不同的话题上，我想问你一些关于疲惫的事情，只是延续你刚才说的。

我有一个非常好的夏天，我完全放松了，我热情地开始新的一年，一周后。已经，我觉得我太累了，做不了任何事，我认为教学的困难之一是你永远不会到达一个终点。永远没有一个点你觉得，好的，我已经做了我需要做的一切，就是这样，我可以关闭。

周末来了，整个，你知道，周日都花在批改和准备上。所以当，例如，礼拜从930变到1030时，我很恼火，因为这意味着我回家更晚，不能做那么多学校作业，但我的意思是，似乎我无法控制这个，我已经教了15年了，每年我，你知道，对自己说，我要实现平衡，但它从来没有发生。所以我只是...

你几点到家？你晚上工作吗？我每天早上大约六点四十五到学校，我大约晚上七点回家。

然后周末也是。你晚上处理事情吗？不。

是的。想想这个。我是一个...

我一直是...我一直倾向于过度工作，我一生中可能每周工作大约75、80小时，作为一名牧师，但这里是...如果你想想你的...

你有七天，除非你想想早上、下午和晚上，诚然如果你的晚上从七点开始，它有点...我的意思是，没关系。你仍然有大约三个小时的房间。

所以你有早上...所以你有21个时段，对吧？七天，三次？

我不是数学专业。数学老师是七乘以三乘以一吗？好的。

你有21个时段。确保你在任何情况下都休七个，你不教学，你不备课七个。然后我一直能够做到那个。

我必须每周休息一天，两天，有三个。这意味着我必须在某个地方休一个下午和一个下午，还有三个其他晚上，因为我晚上出去，我有时晚上工作。如果你能休七个，你就能生存。

我有相当长的一段时间在我的孩子们，出于某种奇怪的原因，不记得我是一个缺席的父亲，这仍然是我不知道我是如何躲过那颗子弹的。关键是如果你有孩子，你在哪里休那七个。只要确保并让自己安息，还做一些与你的工作无关的阅读，并确保对此有纪律，说我每周至少要有两到三个小时阅读。

也许甚至每晚，一小时，一些你正在学习的书，与你的工作无关，总是让你觉得你有更多的生活。只是几个想法。21个中的7个。

是的，丽贝卡。我实际上告诉我的老师回家，我回家，因为这件事，这个参考是我们正在谈论的，要保持新鲜，要为他们有想法，要在情感上休息，在我看来，这是他们从中得到的，而不是你正在准备的实际课程。所以你可能甚至不认识到当情况处于高压时你如何无法互动。

所以你只需要走出来，你不是你的工作。我对我的老师说，你是希拉里，你是一名教师，但你不会成为你的工作，尤其是作为基督徒，你有一个更容易的方式来扎根自己并说这就是它结束的地方。如果你得到的想法少于想法，我知道这一直在发生，你知道，起来把它们写下来然后离开它，因为它只是不可持续。

我认为你必须记住，最终他们得到的是你带给它的精神。如果你筋疲力尽，你没有用对你来说很棒的东西补充自己，果酱或其他什么，那么它会显示出来。这里还有其他人想说点什么吗？

你只是不要在峰会上工作。好的，你的财务状况如何，不要在峰会上工作。凯瑟琳，我们还能提一两个问题吗？

是的，请讲。我是一名教学研究员，在那两年我是教学研究员的时候，我觉得这是一场比赛，我到了第二年，我说，我完了，我要离开我的学校去一个更大更好的地方。但实际上，我在布朗克斯教书，实际上是说服我留在学校的父母。

你知道，出于所有很好的原因。所以话虽如此，丽贝卡，你知道，用那个关于黄金法则的东西，教黄金法则。我在布朗克斯的教室里有26个幼儿园孩子，我们所做的就是教他们黄金法则，关于彼此相爱，彼此友善。

但是当这些孩子回到这些父母那里，他们显然不与他们的老师沟通，教导完全相反的东西时，你会怎么做？因为我们在教室里确实做得很好。教室里没有暴力。

但在操场上，你为什么打那个孩子？因为我妈妈告诉我，如果有人打我，我就打他回去。所以这超出了教室，超出了你作为教师的角色。

你如何解决这个问题？你不能去找父母说，你必须实践黄金法则。那么对这些父母的实际方法是什么？

教师们。我举办育儿工作坊。我们在10月2日做的一件事，珍妮特参加了，我们做的是，我们邀请父母与一个社区组织，一次大会，我们做了一个戏剧工作坊，一个舞蹈工作坊，和一个绘画媒体工作坊。

我们把它作为一个家庭日，我们与我们邀请的家庭一起呼唤时间，我们邀请孩子们与父母一起来我们学校。我认为这是一个行政能力，你需要去找你的管理者，要求他们创造性地思考，而不是举行父母会议，你在那里坐着。事实上，一位家长说会议结束时。

我们汇报了，他们对我说，这太令人耳目一新了，每当我以前参加家长会时，管理者所做的只是对我吠叫，你知道吗？我的态度就是，我对做像对人吠叫这样的事情不感兴趣。我希望他们坐下来实际上与他们的孩子一起做活动，我们邀请员工也做那些活动，但我认为你需要去找你的管理者说，我在这里有一个问题。

我们能否集思广益解决方法？我认为你需要在整个社区的不同时间全面地做这件事。我们的地方有一个困难的人群。

我和有父母的人在一起，他们有很多你说的同样问题，然后是高中。顺便说一下，你作为校长可以做那个，但是，因为她作为老师做不到。她可以去找校长。

好的。是的，问题。但是，我的意思是，我的校长这样做。

我们做周六工作坊，家庭工作坊，但这些父母不来。他们不来参加家长教师会议。

当你打电话给他们时他们不来，他们不接电话。而且，你知道，我想留下来，我想做这个，我想与这些在他们孩子的学校生活中缺席的父母一起工作。所以作为一名教师，我能做什么去那里与这些父母交谈？

什么，有效的事情之一，这是我生活的故事，我今天在会议上待了四个小时，试图解释一些相同的事情。如果你只是非常，如果你逻辑地解释它，也就是说，我理解在街上，因为这正是，我的意思是，我的孩子被跳，他们害怕坦白谁在做什么？因为他们离开学校时会被跳。

这非常严重。有血帮成员。我的意思是，我知道这是很多人的同样故事，但解释是学校。

当你进入学校的门和院子是学校时，那是你的责任的一部分。在课间休息时发生什么？所以我还没有遇到一位家长不达成协议，而且我有，我有父母把它写下来，放在书面上，我告诉他们要打回去，只是让你知道。

但一旦你与他们交谈，你可以作为教师做到这一点，也就是，我如何保护你的孩子？如果你告诉你的孩子打回去，他告诉他的孩子打回去，然后每个人都在打，当我对他们说，我不想你为你的权威服务。他们总是尊重那个。

我不想你为你的权威服务，但我无法保护他们。如果下次是你的孩子，他的父母说了同样的话怎么办？所以当他们走进学校门时，我们必须以不同的方式运作。

我对他们说，我不能告诉你在街上做什么。我理解那是一个不同的问题，但在学校门内，如果你能通过对孩子说来帮助我们，给老师和员工机会，给我机会让他们安全。那是你说的吗？

是的。好的。管理者做，你知道，恶棍，甚至今天我了解有一些类似的情况，一位家长实际上试图打另一个学生，管理者必须介入并让家长意识到你希望我们为你的孩子做什么？

我认为一旦你把它带回家给父母，他的孩子可能是下一个受害者，那么他们确实会退后一步，真的更理性地思考一点。这是一个有点逻辑的过程和后续，他们通常会回家。有很好的答案吗？

请讲。你能听到我吗？一件事是，你知道，这有点是与教育者的所有对话的潜流，作为你的老师，试图从管理层和公立学校教师、教育部实施某种大局的大图景，我曾经是一名教师，所以我理解，但在硬币的另一面，我现在在教育部，我只想让你们所有人知道，今晚我在这里对我来说非常鼓舞。

就其价值而言，教育部有人，每天为你们所有人祷告。很难离开，但是...我当然会说，我会感激，我们都会，嗯，我会感激你的祷告。

然后我对你们所有人的快速问题是，当我是一名教师时，我既在公立学校担任教师，又与布朗克斯和曼哈顿的教区学校合作，有几个时刻，我真的可以给你发一条消息，上帝某种程度上在向我展示，我与家长互动的方式或我在某种情况下的态度完全被他作为基督徒给我的恩典所充满，对不起，我有点难过。所以我对你们所有人的问题是，也许如果你有来自你自己作为教育者的经历的一点轶事故事，如果当你只是说，就像，天哪，除非我有这个世界观，否则我无法处理那个。我开始。

我们谈到我们祷告，我们很多人祷告，我们说我们不能开始我们的一天而不祷告，要么读圣经，要么甚至在学校或与其他人一起，因为我每天到学校时，都带着一种冒险的感觉，因为我们永远不知道，你知道，你有最周密的计划，每个人都应该到位，然后一个孩子摔倒并被割伤。我们有一个轶事，一个幼儿园孩子在院子里摔倒，他们认为她只是碰了她的下巴，当她去看医生时，她的下巴骨折了，她的下巴必须被固定，这是带着恐惧和战兢。当她来时，你如何与那位家长交谈？

在那种情况下你对家长说什么？家长会如何反应？所以总是有这个祷告，家长进来，管理者在那里，我们与家长交谈，然后有时他们以非常敌对的方式进来，有时他们有问题，他们只是需要有人交谈，当我们与他们交谈并要求圣灵把正确的话放在我们嘴里时，有时家长会变得非常平静，或者那位家长可能只是哭泣，或者我们需要只是一个拥抱，我们有孩子的父母正在死去的实例，他们知道他们正在死去，他们有问题，我的孩子会发生什么，只是一个拥抱，然后当那位家长离开，他们感觉更好或情况平静，我们说感谢上帝，你知道，上帝如此美好，我们一直这样说，因为我们没有想法或计划如何面对那种情况，所以它发生，我认为在我的学校几乎每天都会发生。

回到琼几分钟前提出的家长问题，它实际上就在我到这里之前发生了，我说我花了很多时间调查帮派相关事件，我实际上今天学校安全部不得不护送两位家长出去，因为他们对谈话如此愤怒，我想老实说，就像你的第一个倾向之一会是，虽然我无法完成调查，因为你因为你的行为不得不被护送出去，所以也许我只是在没有弄清楚的情况下继续记录这确实发生了，但我坚持了一整天，我给家长回了电话，这真的不是我认为我在上次会议进行的方式之后来这里之前应该做的，并试图在之后积极，但我告诉她调查的状态，她的儿子实际上不是参与事件的一方之一，她说，马龙女士，我整天都感觉很糟糕，我只是想向你道歉，所以我只知道，在那种情况下，就像能够给她回电话的事实，这不是，这只是上帝的恩典，在它有，你知道，两三个人走出来之后给我那个，我知道那只是恩典。

你试图重新编织你可以看出需要相互关联的东西，它们不是，这非常非常非常令人沮丧，但你是基督徒，你知道那意味着什么，那意味着最终你想看到发生的事情会发生，最终会有和平，最终会有正义，最终会有完整的家庭，最终你不会有父母死去，你将拥有一个重新编织的创造，上帝会做到，我的意思是有很多工作比你的工作更令人满意，因为你在制作某物，你把它做好，然后你把它送出去，人们买它，你赚钱，你回家，你的产品是改变生命和成熟和智慧，因此你总是对你的产品不满意，我的意思是，它从来不是你想要的，这非常非常令人沮丧，但你的基督徒，你根本不是在打一场失败的战斗，总有一天每一件悲伤的事都会成真，所以你站在正确的一边，你现在必须活在那种希望中，让我们祷告。

父啊，我们感谢你呼召我们在这个房间里成为教育者，你呼召我们进入一项看起来如此混乱的工作，它不像生产一件机器并销售它，它不像许多其他工作，其中产品是可量化的，底线是如此容易掌握和驱动和识别，我们在谈论改变生命，我们在谈论学习智慧，我们在谈论成熟，我们在谈论人们成为真正的人，这似乎是一个无尽的、也许是失败的事业，但事实并非如此，我们知道不是因为我们是基督徒，我们感谢你，这个房间里的男人和女人是你在世界上医治和修复和重新编织你的创造的代理人的所有方式，感谢复活的耶稣向我们证明，总有一天你会完全实现我们看到我们的城市整体、这个家庭整体的最深切愿望，所以感谢这段时间，继续成为我们伟大的老师耶稣基督，奉他的名祷告。阿们。
