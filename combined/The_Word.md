## 圣诞的奥秘 / The Mystery of Christmas

It is a commercial bananso. They will never be able to get rid of Christmas, ever. And at least not in the foreseeable thousand years.

And therefore, what are we going to do when the message of Christmas is a very opposite of what the culture tells us? And the answer is, is the culture is going to constantly try to re-engineer Christmas? So a couple of years ago, I found this ad in the New York Times.

It was a Christmas ad. It was a commercial ad. Somebody was selling a product.

It was a company. But this is what they said. Quote, the meaning of Christmas is that love will triumph, and that we will be able to put together a world of unity in peace.

Okay, so this ad says, the meaning of Christmas is that if we all pull together, we can do it. We can create a world of unity in peace, which is by the way, the exact opposite of the message of Christmas. Because, see, the message of Christmas is not from them a light has come.

It's upon them a light has dawn. It comes from outside of us. We can't possibly generate that kind of light.

We do not know how to solve our own problems or even stuff. We just can't. It's the opposite of the message.

And yet, pardon me, that's what the message of Christmas, but the culture is going to be constantly trying to re-engineer it, but it won't work. Valkov Hava, who was the first president of Czech Republic, he had been both, he lived under socialism, and he lived under free market capitalism. And you know what he said?

Neither of these things are going to solve the greatest human problems. In fact, he said, technology and science, they can tell you what you can do, and they can tell you how to do it efficiently, but they can never tell you whether you should do it or not. And therefore, he said that neither the technology nor the state government nor the market will ever be able to save us from nuclear conflict or environmental degradation or ethnic violence.

And he says, quote, pursuit of the good life will not help humanity save itself, nor is democracy alone enough. Atturning to and seeking of God is needed. The human race constantly forgets that he is not God, and that's the message of Christmas.

So this world is a dark place, that's 0.1, but 0.2, the other thing we're told here, is that there is a light. Yes, it's outside the human race, but there is a light. The light we need is exists.

Well, where is it? Well, now let's look at verses 1, 2, and 3. And by the way, in verse 14, which we didn't read, we're going to get there in the coming weeks, it says that the word of God is Jesus.

Now I'll get back to this term word later, but right now you can just put the word Jesus in there, because later on in the very chapter it tells us the word of God is another name for Jesus. So let's read this, and here's what verse 1 says. In the beginning was Jesus, and Jesus was with God, and Jesus was God.

All right, let's stop right there. That might be familiar to you, you've heard it before, but let me show you how aptly startling it is, when the two truths that are being given to you in this sense are put next to each other. First of all, it tells us, Jesus is God.

It doesn't say Jesus is a God. There's no article. In the Greek, the original Greek, there's no article.

It doesn't say Jesus Christ was a God. It says Jesus Christ was God. If it said Jesus was a God, then there'd be more than one God, right?

The Bible's not saying that. It's saying that, you know God, the one God, Jesus is that one God. But then, right next to it, it says Jesus was God, Jesus is God, and Jesus is with God.

Now the word with means to have a relationship. You go to the bottom of, well, actually, you go later on in the Gospels, I guess it's in Mark, where it says that when Jesus chose 12 disciples, it says He chose them to be with Him, and to be with means to live with Him, to be His intimates, to be in a love relationship with Him, to be in a relationship of the closest communication and love, so to be with someone, that's a term that in the Bible means to be in a relationship with Him. So here's what it's saying.

There's only one God, and Jesus is God, and yet Jesus is in a love relationship with God, and Jesus is God, and Jesus is in a love relationship with God. And even though the Holy Spirit's not mentioned here, even though the Holy Spirit is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, here's what we got. There's only one God, not three God, there's only one God.

But within that one God, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, no one love each other. There's one God, but inside that one God there's three persons who, from all eternity, notice what it says, it says, through Him all things were made, without Him nothing was made that has been made. Which means the Son, Jesus Christ was not created, everything that ever made through Him, which means that the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, have all from the beginning endlessly known in love each other.

Only Christianity then says that at the very heart of God, only Christianity says this. The very heart of God is a dynamical of relationship. From all eternity in the very being of God, there have been three persons who know each other and love each other and glorify each other and adore each other, and they have been loving and communicating with each other from all eternity.

Inside God there is an exploding, dynamic, infinitely powerful set of relationships. And therefore, the meaning of life is relationship in love. See, if there was one God who only had one personality, one person, and then that person that God created other beings, then love comes in later, right?

There's power and then there's love, isn't that right? If there was one God who only had one person, he was only one personality, one guy with one person, and that person created other beings, then you can't have love until you have other beings, right? Other persons.

So first God is powerful, and then later on comes in love. But if you have a triune God, if you have a God who is the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, from all eternity, then love is first. Love is the most important thing, and relationships are the most important thing, and communication is the most important thing.

But let me go a little further here. I think that this part of the Bible is actually trying to get you, it's really trying to just astonish us with the fact that when the Bible says God is love, you and I probably tend to think, okay, that means God is somehow loving. No, no, no.

God is much more literally that. God from all eternity, before He created the world, before He did anything else, was already love, and dynamic love, interpersonal love, friendship, and in verse 18, we didn't get to that either, but in verse 18, some of you know, because it's such a, you've heard it before, it's so famous, this passage, it says this, from all eternity, the Son was in the bosom of the Father, in the bosom of the Father. I think that that's John's, by using that language, I think John is deliberately trying to get you to use your imagination for a minute.

So will you come with me? As 2025 comes to a close, it should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead. Because of what God is doing to bring people to faith and to renew Christians through the Gospel teaching and resources you help us provide on our podcast, YouTube channel, radio broadcast, quarterly journal, and website, and soon through our translation project.

We're grateful that so many of you are partnering with us to spread the message of Christ's love. Thank you. God continues to provide opportunities for us to expand the ways we share the Gospel.

In 2026, we anticipate adding new international radio broadcasts and additional online ministry partnerships, publishing new books and beginning to make Dr. Keller's sermons available in other languages. So, as we close out the year, we invite you to prayerfully consider making a year end gift to Gospel in life.

The year end gifts we receive are a vital part of how we will prepare for ministry in 2026. Your support allows us to share the story of the Gospel with people in over 200 countries, and we are deeply grateful for your participation in this mission. To make a year end gift, visit gospelonlife.com slash give.

That's gospelonlife.com slash give. And please pray that we would steward your gifts well and that through the ministry of Gospel in life, many new people will find the hope and joy of knowing Christ as Savior. Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs Him because the Gospel truly changes everything.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's message. How many people are there in the world right now that if you were laying on a sofa, you know, without even asking permission, could walk right over to you and lay down right alongside of you and lay right up against you, and that would be fine.

How many people are there like that? Not many, right? And the ones that can do that are in the most intimate relationship possible, right?

他们永远无法彻底消除圣诞节，至少在未来千年内不会。因此，当圣诞的信息与文化告诉我们的完全相反时，我们该怎么办？答案是：文化会不断试图重新定义圣诞节。几年前，我在《纽约时报》上看到一则广告： 这是一则圣诞广告，也是一家公司的商业广告。

但他们说了这样的话：“圣诞的意义在于爱将战胜一切，我们将能够建立一个和平统一的世界。” 好的，这段广告说，圣诞节的意义在于只要我们齐心协力，就能做到。我们可以创造一个和平统一的世界，而这恰恰与圣诞节的信息完全相反。因为，圣诞的信息不是“光明已经降临”，而是“光明已经显现”。

这来自我们之外的地方。我们无法自己产生这种光芒。我们甚至不知道如何解决自己的问题或麻烦。我们做不到。

这是与圣诞节信息的对立面。然而，原谅我，这就是圣诞节的信息，但文化会不断地试图重新塑造它，但这不会奏效。瓦洛赫·哈瓦曾是捷克共和国的第一任总统，他既经历过社会主义时代，也经历了自由市场经济时代。你知道他说过什么吗？

他说，这两种制度都无法解决人类最大的问题。事实上，他说，技术和科学可以告诉你能做什么，以及如何高效地去做，但它们永远无法告诉你是否应该去做。因此，他说，无论是技术、政府还是市场都不能拯救我们免于核战争、环境恶化或种族暴力。他说："追求美好生活不会帮助人类自救，民主本身也不足以解决问题。

转向和寻求上帝是必要的。" 人类总是忘记了这一点，而这正是圣诞节的信息。### 二、有光：三一神的荣耀 #### 耶稣既是神，又与神同在 所以这个世界很黑暗，这是0.1。但0.2，这里还告诉我们有光。

是的，这光来自人类之外，但确实有光存在。那么它在哪里呢？现在让我们看看第1、2和3节。顺便说一下，在第14节中，我们没有读到的内容，接下来几周我们会读到，那里写着"神的话就是耶稣"。

现在我再回到这个“道”这个词，但目前你们可以把这个词理解为耶稣。因为接下来在这一章里，圣经告诉我们，“道”就是指耶稣。我们来读一读，来看一下第一节说了什么。在起初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。

好，我们现在就停在这里。这段话可能对你们来说很熟悉了，你们之前也听过，但让我来展示给你们看，当这两个真理被放在一起时，是多么恰到好处又令人震惊。首先，它告诉我们耶稣是神。圣经没有说耶稣是一个神。

原文中没有任何冠词，在希腊文里也没有冠词。圣经不是说耶稣基督是一个神，而是说耶稣基督就是神。如果说是耶稣是一个神，那就意味着有多个神了，对吧？圣经并没有这么说。

它说的是你们知道的那位唯一的神，耶稣就是那位唯一的神。但紧接着，它又说耶稣是神，并且与神同在。这里的“与”字表示一种关系。实际上，在福音书里稍后的地方，特别是在马可福音中，提到耶稣选择十二个门徒时说，祂拣选他们是要与他们同在。

与某人同在意味着要和祂一起生活，成为祂的密友，建立一个爱的关系，进行最亲密的交流和相爱的关系。因此，“与”这个词在圣经里表示一种与神的关系。所以这里的意思是：只有一个神，耶稣就是神，并且耶稣与神之间有着爱的关系；耶稣是神，并且耶稣与神之间也有着爱的关系。即使这里的圣灵没有被提到，在圣经的其他地方提到了圣灵，但这里我们得到的信息是：只有一个神，不是三个神，只有一个神。

#### 三一神的爱与关系 但是在这一个神，父、子、圣灵之中，却没有彼此相爱。虽然只有一个神，但在这个独一的神里头有三位，从永远到永远，彼此都知晓对方。圣经上说："万物是借着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着祂造的。"**这意味着耶稣基督并不是被创造出来的，而是通过祂创造了万物。**

这就意味着父、子、圣灵从起初就彼此相爱。只有基督教宣称，在神的心中正是这样的关系。神的核心是一个动态的关系。从永远到永远，在神的本质里头有三位彼此知晓、彼此相爱、彼此荣耀和彼此敬拜，并且从永远到永远彼此相爱并彼此交流。

在神里面有一个爆炸性的、动态的、无限强大的关系网络。因此，生命的意义就在于爱的关系。你看，如果只有一个神，只有一个人格，然后这个神创造了其他生物，那么爱就会出现在后来，对吧？有力量和后才有爱，不是吗？

如果只有一个神，只有一种人格，一个单独的人格创造其他生物，那你怎么会有爱，除非有了其他生物，对吧？其他的人。所以首先神是有力量的，然后后来才有了爱。但如果有三一神，如果是父、子、圣灵从永远到永远，那么爱就是第一位的。

爱是最重要的一件事，关系也是最重要的事，交流更是最重要的事。让我再进一步说。我认为这段圣经其实是要让我们惊讶。当圣经说神是爱时，我们可能以为这只是意味着神在某种程度上是爱。

不，不是这样。神远不止如此。从永恒之初，神在创造世界之前，在祂做任何其他事情之前，就已经是爱了，而且是动态的爱、人际关系中的爱和友谊。约翰福音1:18 也没有提到这一点，但在这节经文中，你们中的一些人可能知道，因为它非常著名，这段话这样说：“从永恒之初，子已在父的怀中。

”我认为，通过使用这种语言，约翰显然是想让你花一分钟时间发挥一下想象力。那么，让我们一起想象一下。随着2025年的结束，新的一年即将到来，这并不令人意外，因为我们对未来的希望很大。因为有你们的帮助，神正在通过我们在播客、YouTube频道、广播节目、季度期刊和网站上提供的福音教导和资源带领人们归信，并使基督徒们得着更新。

我们感谢许多与我们合作的人士，共同传播基督的爱的信息。感谢您。神继续为我们提供扩展福音分享方式的机会。在2026年，我们预计会增加新的国际广播节目，并建立更多的在线事工合作伙伴关系，出版新书，并开始将巴刻博士的讲道翻译成其他语言。

因此，在这一年结束之际，我们邀请你们祷告地考虑为“生命中的福音”做出年终捐款。年终捐款是我们准备2026年事工的重要部分。您的支持使我们能够向超过200个国家的人们分享福音的故事，并且我们非常感谢您参与这项使命。要进行年终捐款，请访问 gospelonlife.com/slash-give。

这是gospelonlife.com/slash-give。并且请为我们将您的礼物善用祷告，愿通过“生命中的福音”的事工，许多新人都能找到认识基督作为救主的希望和喜乐。感谢您与我们合作，共同向需要祂的世界传播基督的爱，因为福音确实改变了所有的一切。现在，让我们听戴尔·辛格勒博士继续今天的讲道。

## 藉话语认识上帝 / Knowing God Through the Word

So I think this is what we're being asked. If you want to understand who God is and what God is like, then you have to start to imagine the time in your life when you felt the most loved. Now multiply that by a trillion, trillion, trillion.

Imagine the time in your life when you felt the most understood, the most appreciated, the most adored, the most secure, the most significant. And you remember the joy of that, okay? And it's impossible almost to hold on to that because we're selfish beings.

And so even if you're in a good marriage, those kinds of times come and go. Even if you're in one of the best marriages, those times only come and go because we tend to be selfish and we tend to want to not give to each other, but we want to receive, you know, and we fight. And therefore those times in which we have been the most blissful, the most loved, the most joyful, the most adored, those times they're fleeting, right?

And they're partial, right? Now imagine three persons who are perfect persons who always love and glorify the people they love. Who never are saying you've got to serve me, but they're always serving each other.

And that they're giving themselves to each other exhaustively and completely from all eternity. So you have to take the few moments in your life that you've experienced some of that. Multiply by a trillion, trillion, trillion, and that is the, and that is God.

God is infinitely happy. God is infinitely loving. God is experiencing love and joy.

The fathers and the Holy Spirit are just pouring joy and love and glory into each other's souls endlessly. They're bathed in the joy of each other. They're bathed in the love of each other.

They are therefore infinitely happy, infinitely joyful, infinitely loving. And you know why would God have created other beings to share in it? Why would God create beings that are in God's image?

So that we can do it with each other and with God to share in all that. Now you say, what does all that got to do with the theme? Everything.

Because, here's what I'm trying to show you. First John 1.5, as John wrote three letters, as well as the book of John. First John 1.5 says, this is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you, God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.

Well, what is the light? That's kind of abstract. What is the light?

This is the light. You know why this is the light? This infinite love, this pulsating love.

This isn't just kind of a general sentiment. We're talking about real live interaction, communication. This is the light.

When he says, God is light, that's kind of an abstraction. What is the light we need? This is what we need.

Why? Let's look at our darkness. Every single bit of evil and suffering in this world, the darkness of this world.

What is it at bottom? It's always a lack of love. It's a loss of love.

What is war? What is racism? What is injustice?

What is crime? What is violence? What is divorce?

What is a broken family? What is bereavement? What is grief?

What is sorrow? What is it? It's always the loss of love.

It's always the lack of love, always. That's our darkness. And why do we have problem?

Why can't we generate our own light? Because we're selfish. Because there's something about our heart that says, me first.

You know, here's the great irony about the human nature. We want love. We want love more than anything else.

That's what makes our life meaningful. We know that. You know, nobody, you know, I'd like to, this is true.

I'd like to say it. You know, I've watched people die. I've seen people at the end.

None of them ever say I wish I'd spent more time at the office. None of them say I wish I'd made more money. They all said I wish I'd spent more time with the people I love.

I wish I'd worked on relationships. That's the meaning of life. And yet, at the same time, we've got something in us that says, me first.

You serve me. That's the end of love. Love is you first.

I will serve you. And God's got that. God's got that infinitely.

And because God is therefore infinitely unselfish and loving, he's infinitely happy. And we don't have that. And so, we're in darkness and we need that light.

And by the way, before going on to say, well, how do we get it? Let's keep in mind how different the Christian view of the world is. The Christian view of the universe is because we believe that in the beginning was an interpersonal God who, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, loving each other from all eternity.

You know how different that is? From ancient paganism and modern secularism. Ancient paganism says, here's how the world came about.

There were these multiple power centers called gods. There was all these different gods and they fought with each other. And that's how the earth got created.

世界上有多少人，在你躺在沙发上时，不用问 permission，就能走到你身边躺下来，并且你觉得这很舒服？这样的关系有多少？不多吧？而能够这样的人处于最亲密的关系中。

所以我想这就是我们被要求去思考的问题。如果你想了解上帝是谁和上帝是怎样的，那么你需要开始想象你生命中最感到被爱的时刻。然后将那个感觉放大到万亿万亿万亿倍。想象一下你生命中最感到理解、欣赏、宠爱、安全和重要的时刻，并记住那种喜悦的感觉。

几乎不可能抓住这种感觉，因为我们都是自私的人。即使在一段好的婚姻中，这样的时刻也会来去匆匆。即使是最好的婚姻，这些时刻也只是短暂的，因为我们都倾向于自私，只想接受而不是给予，所以我们常常会争执。因此，那些我们感到最幸福、最被爱、最快乐和最受宠的时刻是转瞬即逝的。

而且是不完全的。现在想象三个完美的人格，他们总是彼此相爱并荣耀对方。他们从不说你必须为我服务，而是永远互相服侍。他们彼此毫无保留地奉献自己，从无穷无尽的时间开始就是如此。

所以你需要将你生命中体验到的一点这样的时刻放大到万亿万亿万亿倍，那就是上帝。上帝是无限的快乐。上帝是无限的爱。上帝正在经历着爱和喜悦。

圣父和圣灵不断地在彼此的灵魂中倾注欢乐、爱和荣耀，他们沉浸在彼此的欢乐之中，沉浸在彼此的爱之中。他们因此是无限的快乐，无限的欢喜，无限的爱。那么，上帝为什么创造其他生物来与之分享这一切？为什么上帝要创造具有上帝形象的生命？

这样我们就可以彼此之间以及与上帝一起分享这一切。#### 光就是神的爱 现在你可能会问，这和主题有什么关系呢？一切都有关系。因为我要向你们展示的是：约翰一书1:5的内容，在约翰写三封信及《约翰福音》的时候。

约翰一书1:5说："这就是我们从主那里所听见、现在也报给你们听的：神就是光，在他毫无黑暗。" 那么，什么是光呢？这有点抽象。什么是光？

这就是光。你知道为什么这是光吗？因为这种无限的爱，这种脉动的爱。这不是一种泛泛的情感。

我们在谈论实际的互动和交流。这就是**我们需要的光。**为什么？让我们看看我们的黑暗吧。

这个世界上的每一点邪恶与痛苦，这个世界的黑暗。最根本的是什么？总是缺乏爱。是失去了爱。

什么是战争？什么是种族主义？什么是不公？什么是犯罪？

什么是暴力？什么是离婚？什么是破碎的家庭？什么是失去亲人？

什么是悲伤？什么是哀痛？它是什么？总是爱的缺失。

总是缺乏爱，永远如此。这就是我们的黑暗。那么我们为什么会有问题呢？为什么我们不能自己发光呢？

因为我们自私。因为心中有一种想法：我第一。这里有一个关于人性的巨大讽刺。我们渴望爱。

我们比任何东西都更渴望爱。这使我们的生活有意义。我们都明白这一点。你知道，没有人会说他们希望在办公室多待些时间。

没有人会说他们希望自己赚更多的钱。他们都表示希望花更多的时间与所爱的人在一起。希望改善人际关系。这就是生活的意义。

然而同时，我们内心深处有一种想法：我第一。您服侍我。这就是爱的终结。爱就是您首先为我做的。

我要服侍您。而上帝知道这一点。上帝无限地知道这一点。因为上帝因此是无限无私和充满爱的，祂是无限快乐的。

而我们没有这样的能力。所以我们处于黑暗中，**我们需要那道光。**#### 基督教世界观与其他观点的对比 顺便说一句，在继续讨论我们如何得到它之前，请记住基督教对世界的看法有多么不同。基督教宇宙观是因为我们相信在起初有一个彼此相爱的神——圣父、圣子和圣灵，从无始以来就相互爱着。

你知道这有多不同吗？与古代多神教和现代世俗主义相比。古代多神教认为世界是如何形成的？那里有多个权力中心被称为诸神，有许多不同的神祇，它们互相争斗。

## 超越古代多神论 / Beyond Ancient Paganism

And that's how this and that happened. So, in other words, ancient paganism believed the world at its heart was multiple power centers struggling against each other, power struggle. Modern secularism doesn't believe in gods.

No, but it believes in an impersonal universe, impersonal. And it believes that the world got here through violent forces and that human beings evolved through survival of the fittest, nature red and tooth and crock claw, the strong eating the weak. So ancient paganism and modern secularism say the essence of the world is power and struggle.

And Christianity says in the beginning there was withness. In the beginning there was withness. In the beginning there was love.

Infinite love, endless love, powerful love. And that love is the light we need. Okay, thirdly, then, how do we get it?

How does it happen? Now, obviously, as the beginning of the book of John, the rest of the book of John is all about that. And so, we have to kind of look ahead, but there's a hint even in here.

And it's down here at the end. The true light, this is verse 9, 10, 11. The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.

He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Now, what this is saying is pretty simple.

And that is that Jesus Christ came into the world to be rejected. He knew he would be rejected. But the ultimate rejection was, they didn't, it says his own did not receive him more than that, his own killed him.

He came to us. We are his own. He created us, verse 1 and 2.

He created us. If you make something, if you make something, it's yours. He made us.

Not only are we his own, but of course, he's our true light. We need him, but he was rejected. And he was put to death.

Why? Well, because this is the darkness in our hearts. We want love, and yet at the same time we're afraid of anybody coming in and saying, you have to serve me.

No, no, I don't want to serve anybody. My heart says I want to be in charge. And so what Jesus Christ had to do was he had to overcome the barrier between ourselves and God.

The Bible says there's a barrier between us and God. And what did he do? He went to the cross and on the cross, two things happened.

Darkness came down. It was the middle of the day. It was the middle of the day.

But Matthew 27.45 says that in the middle of the day, it became completely dark. Darkness came down. Why?

The light of the world descended into darkness. But that was only symbolic. At the same time, he cried out, one verse later, it says, darkness came down.

Verse 45, Matthew 27.45. And Matthew 27.46 says, And he cried out, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? You see, we've been making a connection here between light and love.

Darkness and selfishness. And so let's just make the connection here. What was happening to Jesus on the cross?

Hourly, darkness came down. Inwardly, darkness was coming down. What was it?

It was the loss of love. Jesus Christ went to the cross to take the penalty, our sins deserve. What is the penalty for selfishness?

See, selfishness is His own punishment. Selfishness is the loss of love. If you're in a marriage and both of you are being selfish, nobody has to come along and find you.

Stop being selfish. It's a thousand dollars a day. No, you're losing love.

You're pulling away from each other. It's awful. And it's true in friendships.

It's true in families. It's true everywhere. So what is the punishment that selfishness deserves?

It's the punishment that selfishness always gets. The loss of love. Oh my goodness, but what Jesus was experiencing.

See, the reason why Jesus agony atone for the sins of the whole world. Why he took the punishment for everybody was this. Counselors will tell you and psychologists will tell you but you don't need them to tell you because you know this intuitively anyway.

Is that there is no greater pain and there's no greater psychological pain in trauma than the loss of a spouse through death or divorce. The loss of love. Why?

Because it's a very, very deep kind of love. It's the most intimate kind of relationship and to lose it one way or the other is awful. Oh my goodness, but don't forget, even if you've been married for 60 years, even if you had a great marriage, two human beings can only love each other so much, but the father and the son have loved each other from all eternity and perfectly and can you imagine?

If you're not agonizing just to lose love right now and you're infinite in our infinite kind of limited way, what must it have been like? Think of the agony. Think of the hell that Jesus experienced on the cross.

The agony and pain he experienced on the cross, that loss of love was greater than was so much as greater than anything you and I have ever experienced as a nuclear warhead is greater than the pop of a rubber band. And he died for our sins. And the reason why that is the key to connecting to the light is this.

Number one, objectively, our sins are forgiven. So when I say father forgive me because of what Jesus did, God can forgive my sins and now come into my life and begin to start to fill me with His love. So that I begin to be somebody who actually can start to love other people and you can become someone who can love other people.

It's a matter of money. Listen, it's very, very, very hard to be really generous to people when you can't pay your own light bill. But if you have a lot of money, then it's easier to be generous.

于是地球就这样被创造了。这就是这一切发生的原因。换句话说，古代多神教相信世界的本质是多个权力中心相互斗争，是一种力量的斗争。现代世俗主义不信仰神明， 但认为宇宙是无生命的，且世界通过暴力的力量形成，并且人类通过适者生存进化而来，自然红牙利爪，强者吃弱者。

所以古代多神教和现代世俗主义说世界的本质是权力与斗争。而基督教则说，在起初有见证。在起初有爱。无限的爱，无尽的爱，强大的爱。

而这爱就是**我们需要的光。**### 三、如何得到光：十字架与道 #### 耶稣被拒绝与钉十字架 第三点，那么我们如何得到它呢？它是如何发生的？显然，正如约翰福音开头所描述的那样，整本约翰福音都在讲述这一点。

所以我们必须向前看，但这里甚至有一个暗示。就在下面最后一段中。**真正的光，这是**第9、10、11节的内容：**真正的光是**照亮每个人的光，正进入世界。他在世界里，虽然世界是藉着他造的，世人却不认识他。

他来到自己的地方，自己的人倒不接待他。这段话的意思其实很简单。耶稣基督来到这个世界是要被拒绝的。他知道会遭到拒绝。

但最大的拒绝是他自己的人不仅没有接受他，反而杀了他。他来到我们中间。我们就是他的“自己”。他是创造我们的，参见1节和2节。

他创造了我们。如果你造了什么东西，那就是你的。他创造了我们。不仅如此，当然，他是我们的真光。

**我们需要他，但他被拒绝了，并且被钉死了。**为什么呢？因为这是我们心中的黑暗。我们渴望爱，但同时又害怕有人进来要求我们服侍他。

我不愿意服侍任何人。我的内心想要掌控一切。所以耶稣基督必须克服自己和上帝之间的障碍。#### 十字架上的黑暗：失去无限的爱 圣经说，我们和上帝之间有一道屏障。

他是怎么做的？他去了十字架，在那里发生了两件事。黑暗降临了。那是白天。

是白天。但马太福音27章45节说，在白天中间，变得完全黑暗。黑暗降临了。为什么？

世界的光降入了黑暗之中。但这只是象征性的。同时，他在十字架上喊叫，下一节经文说，黑暗降临了。第45节，马太福音27章45节。

而马太福音27章46节说：“他便大声呼叫：‘我的上帝，我的上帝，为什么离弃我？’”你看，我们在这里已经把光和爱联系起来了。把黑暗和自私联系起来。那么让我们再做一下这个联系。

耶稣在十字架上发生了什么？每小时，黑暗降临了。内心深处，黑暗也在降临。那是什么？

那就是失去爱。耶稣基督去到十字架上承担了我们罪该受的惩罚。自私的惩罚是什么呢？自私就是失去爱。

如果你在一个婚姻中，双方都自私，不需要有人来发现你们。停止自私。这每天要花一千美元。不，你正在失去爱。

你们彼此疏远了。这很糟糕。而且在友谊中也是如此。在家庭中也是如此。

到处都是如此。那么，自私该受到什么样的惩罚呢？它总是会得到这样的惩罚：失去爱。哦天哪，但请看看耶稣所经历的。

要知道，耶稣为全世界人的罪受苦赎罪、承担惩罚的原因是这个。咨询师和心理学家会告诉你，但你不需要他们来告诉你，因为你对此有直觉上的认识。那就是没有比配偶因死亡或离婚而失去更痛苦的事情了，也没有比失去爱更大的心理创伤之痛。为什么？

因为这是一种非常深沉的爱，是最亲密的关系之一，无论以何种方式失去它都是很糟糕的。哦天哪，但请不要忘记，即使你们已经结婚六十年，即使你们有过一段美好的婚姻，两个人之间也只能相爱到一定的程度，但是父亲和儿子从永恒中就彼此相爱得完美无缺，你能想象吗？如果你现在不因失去爱而痛苦不已，并且你是以我们有限的无限方式存在的，那么耶稣在十字架上所经历的痛苦会有多么巨大呢？想想那种痛苦。

想想耶稣在十字架上所经历的地狱般的煎熬。耶稣在十字架上所经历的痛苦和煎熬，那失去爱之痛是如此之大，比你我曾经经历过的任何事情都要大得多，就像核弹头的力量要比橡皮筋爆裂的声音大得多。他为我们受苦赎罪。#### 通过十字架连接到光明 这就是连接到光明的关键所在。

首先，客观地说，我们的罪得到了赦免。所以当我祈求父亲原谅我的时候，因为耶稣所做的一切，上帝可以赦免我的罪，并进入我的生命中开始填充我对他的爱。这样我才能成为一个真正能够去爱别人的人，你也能成为能去爱别人的人。金钱的问题。

## 道成肉身 / The Word Made Flesh

A lot of people aren't generous with it, but it's at least possible. And the same thing with love, it's very hard to love other people and not be selfish when your own insights are so needy. When you don't feel very lovable yourself, but when God's love starts to pour in through the cross, when you see that Jesus Christ lost infinite love out of love for you, that begins to melt your heart, and that begins to fill you up.

And you become rich in love so you start to be able to give other people love without always doing it in a kind of selfish way or a manipulative way. But so that's what Jesus has to do, but here's what you have to do. Here's what you have to do.

You have to make him your reason for life. Now, what do I mean by that? What I'm about to tell you in the next two minutes could have been the whole sermon.

But I like to go back to the very beginning where it says, in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. Why is Jesus Christ called the word? It's the Greek word logos, from which we get our word logic, and also reason, right, logic or reason.

And actually, when John says, Jesus Christ was the logos, he is deliberately connecting to a major cultural debate that was going on at that time. Because the Greek philosophers believe that there was a logos behind the universe. There was a reason behind the universe to understand what they meant.

Think of this. You do not know how to use, let's just say, an appliance, unless you know the reason it was made. For example, if I take my watch and I try to hammer a nail with it, I'm going to ruin the watch, you know why?

Because I'm not aligning with the reason the logos of the watch. The logos of the watches, the reason it was made. What was it made for?

It was made to tell time not to hammer nails. And therefore, unless I align myself with the logos of the watch, the watch will not work. If you take a space heater and you try to cook on it, you might burn down your apartment.

You know why? Because the logo of the space heater is not to be cooked upon. It's to heat your space.

And if you're not aligning yourself with the logos of the space heater, you're in danger. Well, the Greek philosopher said, well, what if there's a logos to human life? What if there's a logos to the world?

What if there's a logos behind the universe? And if we align with that, in other words, what if there was a purpose for human life? And if we aligned with that, that our lives would go well.

So they argued about it. And they thought the logos was a proposition, a way of living. And this person said, well, the logo, there were various schools of thought.

And some philosopher says, well, I think it's this. This is the logos. And other philosophers thought this is the logos.

And some philosophers thought there is no logos. But they all said that you get to it through philosophical contemplation, through philosophical reasoning and thinking you can discern the reason that human beings were supposed to live. And then you align yourself with it, and along comes John.

And he blows it all up, the gospel of John. And he brought an idea in that was revolutionary in the history of human thought. And he says, yes, there is a logos.

Yes, the universe does have meaning. Yes, there actually is a reason for life. There is something you were created for.

But that logos, that reason, is not an abstract proposition. It's a person that you know and love. It's Jesus Christ, and he's come into this world and you can know and love him.

You know how revolutionary that was? If Jesus is the reason for life, that's what it means when it says, in the beginning, was the logos. If Jesus is the reason for life, then I don't have to be a philosopher.

It's a certain that anybody can have a relationship with him. And it means that the meaning of life is not so much knowledge and contemplation and philosophical knowledge. It's love.

And therefore, let me ask you a question. Is Jesus the reason for your life? Is Jesus the reason you get up in the morning?

Is the reason you get out of bed? I'm not asking you to believe in Jesus. Do you pray to Jesus?

Do you hope that Jesus will help you? I mean, is he your very reason for life? Is he the whole reason you're living?

He was yours. What do you think about that? Jesus was perfectly happy in heaven.

That was the point two here of the sermon. He was doing fine. He didn't need the trip.

He was just fine. Why did he come? Why did he go through all that?

What was the very reason for his human life? It was you and me. His very reason for life was you and me.

Now you go make him your reason for life. It's only fair. And when you make him your reason for life, the very reason that you live your life day to day.

He'll fill you with love and you'll become part of the solution that this dark world needs instead of part of the problem. Let us pray. Our Father, we thank You that there is a light.

That light is the dynamic love and joy that You are capable of. And You make us capable of. We thank You that Your Son was willing to lose all that, to lose all that joy, to lose all that love in order to bring us into it.

And therefore, oh, we need light, but there is a light. And we pray that You would fill us with Your light and Your love. And make us Your like Your Son.

It's in His name that we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life podcast.

听我说，当你连自己的电费都交不起时，真正慷慨给别人是非常非常难的。但如果你有很多钱，那么变得慷慨就容易多了。很多人并不大方地付出，但这至少是有可能的。同样地，爱也是一样，当你的内心如此需要的时候，要不自私地去爱人是非常困难的。

当你自己都不觉得自己可爱时，但当上帝之爱通过十字架开始涌入你的心中，当你看到耶稣基督为了爱你而失去了无限的爱，这开始融化你的心，也开始填满你。于是你就变得充满了爱，所以你可以开始无条件地给予别人爱，而不是总是出于自私或操控的目的。但是这就是耶稣要做的事情，现在轮到你们了。#### 耶稣是"道"（Logos）：生命的意义 现在你们需要做什么？

你需要让耶稣成为你生命的原因。那我具体指的是什么呢？接下来我要告诉你的两分钟内容本来可以是整个布道的核心。但我喜欢回到最开始的地方，那里写着：“起初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。

”为什么称耶稣基督为“道”呢？这个词来自希腊语的logos，我们从这个词得到了逻辑和理由这两个概念，对吧，逻辑或理由。实际上，当约翰说耶稣基督是logos时，他故意连接到了当时一个重要的文化辩论。因为当时的希腊哲学家认为宇宙背后有一个原因或逻辑。

他们认为理解这一点很重要。想象一下这个场景：你不知道如何使用某个电器，除非你知道它被制造的原因。例如，如果我用我的手表去钉钉子，我会毁掉手表，你知道为什么吗？因为我没有按照手表的逻辑来行事。

手表的设计目的是显示时间而不是用来钉钉子。因此，除非我与手表的逻辑保持一致，否则手表就不会正常工作。如果你拿一个空间加热器来做饭，你可能会烧毁你的公寓。——> 《约翰福音》1:1-3 > 你知道为什么吗？

因为空间加热器的标志是用来取暖的，而不是用来煮东西的。如果你不按照空间加热器的标志行事，那你就有危险了。希腊哲学家曾说，如果人类生活也有一个标志呢？世界是不是也有一个标志？

宇宙背后是不是有一个标志？如果我们顺应这个标志，也就是说，人生是不是有目的？如果我们顺应它，我们的生活就会顺利。他们争论过这个问题，并认为这个标志是一种生活方式或一种理念。

有人认为，这个标志是这样的。而其他哲学家则认为是那样的。有些哲学家甚至认为没有这种标志。但他们都认为可以通过哲学思考和理性分析来找到人类应该生活的理由。

然后你顺应它，约翰出现了。他颠覆了《约翰福音》。他提出了一种革命性的思想，在人类思想史上具有重要意义。他说：“是的，有一个标志。

” “宇宙是有意义的。”“生命确实有原因。”“你是被创造出来做某事的。” 但这个标志，并不是一个抽象的理念，而是一个你认识并爱的人——耶稣基督。

他已经来到这个世界，你可以认识和爱他。你知道这有多革命吗？如果耶稣是生活的理由，那么《约翰福音》开头所说的“在起初有道”就具有了意义。如果耶稣是生活的理由，那我就不需要成为哲学家了。

任何人都可以与他建立关系。**这意味着生命的意义不在于知识、思考或哲学上的理解，而在于爱。**因此，我想问你一个问题：耶稣是你生活的原因吗？你每天早上起床是因为耶稣吗？

我不是让你相信耶稣。你是否向耶稣祈祷呢？你希望耶稣帮助你吗？我是说，他是不是你生命的意义所在？

你活着的全部意义就是因为他吗？他曾属于你。你觉得呢？耶稣在天堂里过得非常愉快。

这是讲道中的第二个要点。他一切都好，根本不需要这次旅行。他一切都很好。为什么他会来？

为什么他会经历这一切？他的整个人生的意义是什么？就是为了你和我。他生命的意义就是为了你和我。

现在轮到你们让他成为你生命的意义了。这很公平。当你让耶稣成为你生命的意义——你每天生活的全部意义时， 他会充满爱，你会成为这个世界需要的解决方案的一部分，而不是问题的一部分。### 结束祷告 让我们祷告：我们的父，我们感谢您赐下了光明。

那道光就是您所拥有的动态之爱和喜悦。也是您让我们能够拥有的。我们感谢您，您的儿子愿意放弃这一切——放弃所有的快乐、所有的爱， 只是为了把我们带入其中。因此，哦，**我们需要光明，但有光明在。**

我们祈求您充满我们的生命，赐给我们您的光和爱。使我们成为像您的儿子一样的人。以上祷告奉耶稣的名。阿门。
