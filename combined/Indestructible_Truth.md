## 人类罪恶的根本问题 / The Question of Human Evil

There's a little bit of a guess that there's new people here tonight that haven't been part of any series and this is actually part of a series and we've been actually talking about what's wrong with us. I mean the human race.

Captain I just watched a video of a movie I think it came out last year was just called Paradise Road, true story of a prison of war camp in Sumatra, World War II and all of those true stories, whether it's the book Shanton Compound by Langdon Gilgi or the accounts of the death cast by Victor Frankel or this movie, they're gripping of course but there's a whole lot more than that. What happened in the Holocaust? What happened in World War II?

What happened on the battlefield, what happened in the prison camp was this, the optimistic views of human nature that were very very prevalent for about a hundred years before that in the West. The optimistic views, the views that said basically evil is a matter of a bad family nurturing or a lack of education or not the right socialization process or just false consciousness. All those kinds of optimistic approaches were devastated.

They were devastated because when you're in the midst of one of those experiences, when you're in the midst of, when they were in the midst of World War II, two questions keep coming up. See, what's wrong with us that we're capable of this and what are we going to do about it? What's wrong with us and how can we address it and what's interesting about this chapter, it's very easy to forget who this was written to.

There's a lot of disagreement among scholars about the book of Isaiah but one thing everybody's in agreement about is Isaiah chapter 40 through 55 was written for a nation that was facing exile was written to the Israelites who were about to face all the stuff we're talking about, captivity, atrocities, prison. And it was written to them to answer the same two questions, what's wrong with the human race and what are we going to do about it and this is the answer, maybe the best answer, maybe the most famous answer in the Bible to the question about human evil. Here's the answer, God sending somebody, the servant of the Lord and what we learn in, we take a look at the text is we learn who he is, why he came and what he did, pretty much everything, right?

这里可能有些新朋友今晚第一次参加我们的系列讲道，实际上我们一直在谈论人类的问题。船长，我刚刚看了一部电影的视频。这部电影去年上映了，名叫《天堂之路》，讲述的是二战期间在苏门答腊的一个战俘营的真实故事。类似的还有兰登·吉尔吉的著作《尚顿集中营》和维克多·弗兰克尔对纳粹死亡集中营的描述。

这些故事虽然引人入胜，但背后的意义远不止于此。大屠杀发生了什么？二战期间又发生了什么呢？战场上的事情、战俘营里的事情是这样的：在那之前大约一百年的时间里，在西方非常盛行一种乐观的人性观。

这种观点认为，邪恶主要是由于不良的家庭养育、缺乏教育或不正确的社会化过程，或者是错误的意识造成的。所有这些乐观的观点都被摧毁了。它们被摧毁的原因在于，当人们身处于那种经历之中时——比如在二战期间，两个问题不断浮现：我们为什么会有这样的能力？我们应该如何应对呢？

这两个问题是人类种族的问题所在，也是**我们需要解决的问题。**有趣的是，在这一章节中，很容易忘记它写给谁的。学者们对《以赛亚书》有很多不同的看法，但有一件事是所有人都同意的，《以赛亚书》第40章到55章是为一个即将被流放的国家写的，是为那些将要面对我们谈论的一切——囚禁、暴行和战俘的以色列人写的。它是为了回答同样的两个问题：人类种族出了什么问题？

我们应该如何应对呢？这可能是圣经中对人类邪恶最直接的答案之一。答案是这样的：上帝派遣了一位仆人，这位仆人的身份、他为何而来以及他的行动，在文本中都有详细的描述，几乎涵盖了所有内容，对吧？谁是他，他为什么来，做了什么？

## 他是谁：耶和华的膀臂 / Who He Is: The Arm of the Lord

Who he is, why he came, what he did, let's take a look, first of all who he is. Now there's a little, there's a lot in this passage and when we get to the top, you see it pretty straight off the bat, it says see my servant will act wisely, he'll be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. Now actually that's the same terminology that describe the one that Isaiah saw in the temple, back in Isaiah 6, when it says, I went to the temple and I saw the Lord high and lifted up the same words, it's got to do with the transcendence, the transcendent majesty of God, it's got to do with the purity, the perfection, it's amazing that the same terms would be attached to this person, but the real amazing thing is verse 1, and you don't notice it right off the bat and there's a number of ways to translate it, let me just tell you what he's saying, verse 1, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed.

Now let me give you a little bit of a paraphrase of this, what he's saying is who has believed our message, that this is the arm of the Lord, it's going to take revelation, Isaiah is saying, nobody's going to believe that this one, this servant, is the arm of the Lord, nobody's going to believe it, and here's why, the arm of the Lord is not just a kind of nice metaphor that Isaiah came up with on the spot, the arm of the Lord is a specific, has a very specific, very definite meaning in the Hebrew Bible and also especially in the book of Isaiah. The arm of the Lord is the Lord himself come into history to do something concrete. The arm of the Lord is what moved the Red Sea, part of the Red Sea.

See, the arm of the Lord is not God's strength in general, of course arm, if it was the eye of the Lord we'd be talking about the knowledge of God, but the arm of the Lord is the power of God, but not just any kind of power, it's not just general strength, it's God's power in history. And no wonder Isaiah says, look, I know people aren't going to believe it, nobody's going to believe that this is the arm of the Lord reveal, this is the arm of the Lord. This person is the omnipotent God come into history.

---

让我们先来看一看他是谁。这段经文里有不少内容，当你读到顶部时，会发现它直接告诉你：“看我的仆人要智慧行事，他必被高举上升，大大升高。”实际上，这些词和以赛亚在以赛亚书6章中所描述的那位在圣殿中的那个人使用的词语是一样的。这与神的超越性、至高的尊贵有关，也与神的纯洁和完美有关。

令人惊讶的是，在这人身上使用了同样的词汇，但更令人惊讶的是，第1节的内容，你可能一开始没有注意到，这里有几种不同的翻译方式。让我告诉你他到底说了什么：第1节，“谁信我们的信息？向谁彰显了耶和华的手臂？” 现在我给你一个稍微改写一下的解释，他说：“谁信我们的信息，说这是耶和华的手臂？

这需要启示，以赛亚在说，没有人会相信这个仆人就是耶和华的手臂。为什么呢？因为耶和华的手臂不仅仅是一个即兴创造的比喻，而是《希伯来圣经》中、特别是以赛亚书中非常具体且明确的概念。耶和华的手臂是指神亲自进入历史来做一些具体的行动。

耶和华的手臂是分开红海的力量。也就是说，耶和华的手臂不是指神的一般能力，当然，如果是耶和华的眼睛，我们就是在谈论神的知识。但耶和华的手臂是指神的历史力量，而不仅仅是普通的体力。难怪以赛亚说，看吧，他知道人们不会相信这一点，没有人会相信这是耶和华手臂的彰显，这是全能的神进入历史。

## 基督教的本质：行动而非建议 / The Essence of Christianity: Action, Not Advice

Now before we move on, we've got to move on, let me just say what's neat about this passage, it's got to do with essentials. In fact, the more I look at this, who is why he came, you know, what he came to do. This really gets a kind of essential definition, this whole passage for example, you know, Aristotle brought us the distinction between what he called the essence and the accidents, the essentials and the accidentals.

So for example, what if you've never seen clay, you've never seen steel before in your life? And I put in front of you a ball of clay and a steel-eye beam and I said, okay, what's the difference between clay and steel? And you looked and said, I got it, clay is round, steel is long.

And you'd say, it's hard to laugh in here, isn't it, but try. Okay, you know, you can laugh under curly cues. You don't just need graffiti, okay, now, that's better.

You'd say, you've missed the essence, those are accidentals, it's sort of an accident. Clay can take numbers of shapes, but the shape is an essential, shape is not essential. It's the, you know, it's softness, hardness, chemical composition, all that kind of thing.

Now, what's the essence of Christianity? Well, you say Christianity leads people to love one another. Yeah, yeah, but hey, there's a lot of people who aren't Christians that are very loving.

Well, Christianity leads you, it gives you strength, gives you peace, makes you good. Yeah, but those are accidental. I don't mean they're accidents.

I'm using it in the Aristotelian terms, they're not, they're not the essential. They're not, they overlap with lots of other groups of people. What's essential?

The armeness of Christianity. What do I mean? All right, here's what I mean.

Jesus Christ is not here called the mouth of God, the mouth of the Lord. He's called the arm of the Lord. That doesn't mean he didn't come to teach.

He's a teacher, but it didn't primarily come to tell you what to do. He came primarily to do. And that's the essential difference between Christianity and every other religion.

Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God.

Do this. Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it.

It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice. You see, the other founders come with advice and they say, hey, here's how you can change your life. But news is this is what's happened that changes your life.

---

现在我们继续之前的内容，让我们来看看这段经文里有什么有趣的地方。实际上，这与核心要点有关。事实上，我越看这段经文，就越能理解他来的原因和目的。这一整段话都涉及到了一些本质性的定义。

举个例子来说，假设你从未见过黏土或钢铁，现在我把一块黏土和一根钢梁放在你面前，然后问你：它们有什么不同？你说，黏土是圆的，而钢梁是长的。你会说，在这里很难笑出来，但试着笑一下吧。好吧，你可以笑一笑。

现在好了。你说，你已经错过了本质的东西，那些只是表面特征。形状只是一个偶然。黏土可以变成各种形状，但形状本身并不是关键，关键在于它的软硬、化学成分等。

那么，基督教的本质是什么呢？你说基督教教导人们彼此相爱。是的，没错，但这有很多非基督徒也非常善良的人。基督教给你力量，给你平安，使你变得更好。

是的，这些都是表面特征。我不是说它们是偶然发生的。我是用亚里士多德的观点来说的，这些不是核心本质。它们与其他许多群体重叠。

那么，什么是核心本质呢？基督教的核心本质在于“基督性”。具体是什么意思？让我来解释一下。

在这一段经文中，并没有称耶稣为上帝或主的代言人，而是称他为“主的手臂”。这并不意味着他不教导人，他是位教师，但他主要不是来告诉你该做什么。他是来行动的。这就是基督教与其他所有宗教的本质区别。

耶稣基督并不是以本质的方式来的。每一个其他创始人都会说，耶稣没有来。每一个其他宗教都会说，我要教你如何与神连接。做这个。

耶稣基督说，我会让你与神连接。或者说，用另一种方式表达，就是不同的表达方式而已。**这意味着，比如福音是新闻，不是建议。**你看，其他的创始人带着建议而来，并且他们会说：“嘿，这是你如何改变生活的办法。

## 基督教故事必须是真实的 / Christian Stories Must Be True to Work

Now, if I, what? Some of you may have heard me say this before, but let me put it to another way that I think brings it home. The stories of Christianity don't work unless they're true.

Whereas the stories of other religions work anyway. See, for example, what's the purpose of Buddhism? What's Buddhism about?

It's about enlightenment. It's a wonderful faith. It's got lots of great stuff to teach us, it's about enlightenment.

And it's about an attitude toward life, an attitude toward suffering, an attitude toward not grasping and working against the craving ego. So all the stories about Buddha, does it matter if they're true or not? No, it doesn't.

Here's why. I mean, they might be, they may not be. The point is, they're inspiring and they're exemplary.

They tell me how to find enlightenment. They tell me how to live and they work with their true or not. Muhammad, in many no disrespect anybody, but take a look at the stories of Muhammad.

What is Islam about? Well, the word Islam means submission, obedience, not so much enlightenment, obedience to Allah. So all the stories about Muhammad work in this.

Whether they're true or not, they show me how to submit, they show me what to do, right? So they work. Let's look at the stories of Christianity.

Okay, let's look at the Christmas story, born in a manger. Okay, what's the moral of that story? Have natural childbirth?

What's the moral? Homelessness is fine. What's the moral?

Listen, there is no moral. The story is this, the arm of the Lord. The ideal has broken into history.

It's become real. Finally, and this has happened and it's changes everything. Well, in fact, let me, let's get more to the point.

Let's take a look at the story in front of us, the cross. There's a Christian story. Jesus died on the cross for our sins.

Now, what's the moral of that story? If that story's not true, think about this for a second. You say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's true.

It's just, it's inspirational. Oh, really? Let's think about this for a minute.

What's the moral of the story? Don't protect yourself. You're the victim of what, is it say, oppression?

When oppression comes to you, you just give in. You just let them walk all over you. You don't open your mouth, you don't protest.

Just let injustice roll over you, is that? Is that the moral of the story? That's perverse.

You know, there's another way to put it, okay? I put it to you like this. Let's just say you and I have gone to the top of the Empire State Building.

And we're looking out there and all of a sudden, you come to me and say, Tim, I just want you to know how much I love you. I want you to know how much I care for you and I'm gonna show you how much I love you. And you get up on the ledge and you say, watch.

And you throw yourself off and down you go to your death. And I do I look over the ledge and I say, look how that person loves me. How do I do I?

No, I was, what's wrong with that person? But what if I, because I'm stupid or because I'm a fool or something, what if I get to the edge myself and I'm about to fall off and you come over and you push me to safety but in the process you fall? Now listen, the crucifixion is something has happened in history that changes everything.

The servant has come to take your punishment, changes everything. If it's not true, it's not just unimportant, it's bad. It's not just that the story doesn't work.

If it's not true, it actually works badly. It's a perverse, it's a, it's pernicious. Unless the story's a Christianity or true, unless Jesus Christ is the arm and not just the mouth.

See, Christianity is really bad for you. Very, very bad, terrible. It's one of the other, he is the arm of the Lord.

Okay, that's who came. It's God himself acting in history.

"但是新闻是告诉你发生了什么，这会改变你的生活。现在，如果我这么说？你们中有些人可能之前听过我说过类似的话，但让我用另一种方式来说，我认为这样更能说明问题。基督教的故事只有在它们是真的的情况下才有效。

而其他宗教的故事即使不是真的也依然有效。你看，比如佛教的目的和意义是什么？是关于觉悟的。这是一个美好的信仰，有很多值得我们学习的东西，它是关于觉悟的。

它关乎对生活的态度，对待苦难的态度，不执着于欲望和自我。所以关于佛陀的所有故事，它们是真的还是假的有关系吗？没有关系。为什么呢？

我说，可能真的，也可能不是。**关键是，这些故事是鼓舞人心且具有典范作用的。**它们告诉我如何找到觉悟，如何生活，并且无论真假都有效。穆罕默德，在这里我没有冒犯任何人，但让我们看看穆罕默德的故事。

伊斯兰教关于什么？伊斯兰这个词意味着顺从、服从，而不是那么多的觉悟，而是对真主的顺从。所以关于穆罕默德的所有故事都是这样。它们是否真实并不重要，它们告诉我如何顺从，告诉我该怎么做，是吧？

所以它们有效。现在让我们看看基督教的故事。好，我们来看看圣诞故事，出生在马槽里。好的，这个故事的意义是什么？

自然分娩吗？意义何在？无家可归没关系吗？意义何在？

我说，其实没有意义。这个故事是这样的，主的手伸入了历史之中。它变得真实了。终于发生了，并且这一切都改变了。

实际上，让我直接一点说。让我们看看我们面前的故事，那就是十字架。这是一个基督教的故事。耶稣为了我们的罪而死在十字架上。

那么这个故事的寓意是什么呢？如果这个故事不是真的，你可能会说：“哦，没关系，它不重要。” 它只是激励人心而已。真的吗？

让我们想一想。这个故事的寓意是什么？不要保护自己。你是受害者，是被压迫的对象吗？

当压迫来临的时候，你就屈服了。任由他们欺负你，你不开口，也不抗议。就这样让不公正压垮你了吗？这就是这个故事的寓意吗？

这太荒谬了。换个角度来说吧，假设我和你登上了帝国大厦的顶端。我们站在那里向外眺望，突然你说：“蒂姆，我想让你知道我有多么爱你。我想让你知道我对你的关心，我要让你看看我是多么爱你。

”然后你站到边缘说：“看好了。” 接着你就跳下去自杀了。这时我站在旁边，我会怎么想？不，这个人哪里有问题？

但如果是我愚蠢或无知，自己走到边缘准备跳下去，而你过来救了我但你自己却掉下来了呢？现在听我说，十字架上的事件在历史上发生了，它改变了所有的一切。仆人来承担你的惩罚，这就改变了所有的一切。如果这个故事不是真的，那就不只是无关紧要的问题了，而是很糟糕的事情。

不只是说这个故事没有意义。如果这个故事不真实，它实际上会起反作用，它是荒谬的，是有害的。除非基督教是真实的，除非耶稣基督不仅是口中的声音，也是行动的力量。你看，基督教对你来说是非常有害的，非常非常不好，非常可怕。

它是主的手臂，而不是仅仅嘴巴的声音。这就是他来的目的。他是上帝自己在历史中行动。

## 他为何而来：罪的本质 / Why He Came: The Essence of Sin

Second, that's who he came and the wider he comes now.

Again, we're getting into essence because the reason he came and his look, verses four through six, there's a whole sleut of a great vocabulary where it's a whole survey of almost every kind of way to describe human evil. Sin, look, you've got infirmities. See, transgressions andiquities.

By the way, some of you, of all the words, by the way, that's almost my favorite one because you know what? The Hebrew word translated iniquity, it's a shame. It doesn't come across in English at all.

It means bent, bent, okay? Bent means it doesn't work, but if you try to unbend, it'll just make it worse. It'll break.

But in the midst of all of these interesting words, there's one that kind of gets at the essence of what's wrong with us. So this is the answer to the question. What's wrong with us?

Here it is. Verse six, very famous, but overlooked. All we like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way.

---

第二点，这也是他来的方式，现在他以更广泛的形式出现。

再次进入本质，因为祂来的原因和他的形象，在四至六节中，有一大串丰富的词汇，几乎涵盖了描述人类邪恶的每一种方式。罪、过犯、软弱、违背和不义。顺便说一句，你们中有几个人注意到这些词中的一个特别能揭示我们的问题所在？对我来说，这个词几乎是最喜欢的，因为它在希伯来文中是“不义”，这个单词在英文中根本无法完全传达它的意思。

它意味着弯曲。弯曲意味着不能正常工作，但如果你试图把它弄直，只会让它更糟，甚至会折断。在这段有趣的描述中，有一个词特别能揭示我们的问题所在。这就是答案：六节，非常著名但也常被忽视。

## "我先"：无法删除的冲动 / "Me First": The Undeletable Impulse

Now you say my word, this is the central place where God is telling us the secrets of what's wrong with us, of human evil. This is a definition of evil. This is a definition of sin, own way.

My word you say, I mean, you know, why not murder or robbery or something like that? I mean, every little kid wants their own way. I'm glad you said that.

Look, a friend of mine who's, he's a lifetime bachelor. He's a preacher and I listen to his sermons. And but since he's a lifetime bachelor, when he actually comes across children, he's always struck by them in a way that I don't, any more because I've, you know, being a parent I'm sort of surrounded by them.

One day he was at a retreat and he was walking with a whole family of five and he were walking along and they were on their way to a pony corral. And the parents were saying to Charles, there was Charles and Sarah and Sally. And the parents said, now Charles, you rode the pony all morning.

It's Sarah and Sally's turn. So it's their turn. And he said, oh, he nodded his head.

They rounded a turn. They got near the corral. And as soon as they got near the corral, Charles dart off ahead of everybody, ran into the crowd, ran up to the staff person who was in charge of it, and said, me first.

And my friend, you know, this profound, what kind of illustration is this? But he was amazed by it. Yeah, I'm amazed.

But then he suddenly thought about it. He says, well, wait a minute. What if this is the unbelievable heart of every microchip in the soul of every human being?

Can never be put out? What if this is essential? Well, there's many, many, many accidental.

I mean, there's many forms of it. But what if this is something we can never delete? He says, if me first, basically, is what's wrong?

What are death camps? What is war? What is every single crime?

What is every crime? Come on. What's the essence of every crime?

Me first. That's it. I mean, years ago, Burger King had a song.

Remember, it had a little ditty. It said, have it your way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin.

Frank Sinatra sang, I did it my way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin. But now, look, it's not just very helpful.

Very helpful showing us, basically, my way. Me first, how that shows what our relationships with each other, but essentially, it shows us our relationship with God. Because it doesn't say we are all like snakes, gone to our own way.

Snakes know their way. Sheep need a shepherd. And when sheep want to go their own way, what they're saying is, I want to be my own shepherd.

And when a human being goes its own way, what we're saying is, I want to be my own maker. We're not totally sure whether Psalm 100 booted off of Isaiah 53 or whether I Isaiah 53 boots off of Psalm 100. But I hear, listen, Psalm 100 says, know that the Lord is God.

It is He who has made us and not we ourselves for where is people, the sheep of this pasture. Now, very simple, listen. This is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea to think so much of sin in terms of breaking rules.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

"我们都像羊走迷了路，各人偏离正道。" 你说我的话，这正是上帝告诉我们人类邪恶本质的地方。这是对恶的定义，也是对罪的定义——自己的道路。我说，你为什么不说谋杀或抢劫之类呢？

每个小孩都想要自己的方式。很高兴你能这么说。让我给你讲个故事。我有一个朋友，他终身未婚，是一名牧师。

我经常听他的布道。由于他是终身单身，当他遇到孩子时，总是会被他们触动，而这种感触我已经很久没有了，因为我作为父母，身边总是围绕着孩子。有一天，他在一个 retreat 上，和一个五口之家一起散步，正走向马驹围栏。父母对查尔斯、莎拉和萨莉说：“查尔斯，你今天早上一直在骑马，现在轮到莎拉和萨莉了。

” 他点点头。他们转过弯，接近围栏时，查尔斯突然冲在所有人前面，跑到人群中，向负责的人跑去，喊道：“我先来。” 并且我的朋友，你知道吗，这个深刻的比喻到底是什么？但他对此感到非常惊讶。

是的，我也很惊讶。然后他突然想到了这一点。他说：“等等，如果这是每个灵魂中每一个微芯片的核心呢？”这种东西永远无法被抹去？

如果是这样，那它是不是必不可少的？我意思是，它的形式有很多很多种。但如果是这样，那这是否是我们永远都无法删除的东西？他说：“如果‘自我’是问题所在，那又如何呢？

” 什么是集中营？什么是战争？每一种犯罪是什么？每一种犯罪的本质是什么呢？

来吧，说说看。每一种罪的核心到底是什么？“自我”第一。就是这样。

几年前，麦当劳有一首歌。你还记得吗？它还有一段小曲子：“按你的口味来。”根据第六节经文，这就是罪的本质。

弗兰克·辛纳屈唱道，“我按我的方式来做”。根据第六节经文，这也是罪的本质。但现在，看看吧，这不仅仅是非常有帮助的。这非常有助于让我们明白“自我”第一、我先来是怎么影响我们彼此的关系的，但本质上，它也揭示了我们与神的关系。

因为经文并没有说我们都像蛇一样，各自为政。蛇知道自己的路。羊需要牧人。当羊想要走自己的路时，它们实际上是在说：“我想做自己的牧人。

” 而当人类走上自己的道路时，我们在说：“我想做自己的创造者。”我们并不确定诗篇100篇是否源自以赛亚书53章，还是反之亦然。但听我说，诗篇100篇说：“要知道耶和华是神，他造了我们，并不是我们自己。” 在这一片牧场上的人类都是他的羊群。

现在，非常简单，听我说。这正是我们认为从罪的角度过多关注规则的破坏性并不是个好主意的原因之一。无论我们走到哪里，都能看到破碎、战争、残忍和痛苦。我们在世界周围以及自己的生活中都能感受到这一切。

它是如何变成这样的，又该如何改变呢？在他的新书《世界的错谬》中，蒂姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而充满同情的答案。这本书是根据他在复兴堂的一系列讲道整理而成的。Keller 展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围所见的一切痛苦，以及只有福音才能带来持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被这个世界的状态压垮了，还是在自己的错误或选择中挣扎，或者是在寻找希望与欢乐，这本书《世界出了什么问题》都能帮助你看到福音如何回应这个世界的伤痛和个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书是我们感谢你们本月捐赠的一部分，以此来帮助福音和生命分享耶稣的好消息。立即访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取你的副本。这是 gospelandlife.com/give。

## 罪是粉碎而非刮伤 / Sin as Shattering, Not Scratching

If you say sin is breaking rules, God's rules, and that's partly, that's one perspective, but if you start there, here's the problem. Let's just say you just cheated on the test.

You get cheated on the test. Well, that's something like robbery. So you think of sin and you can actually say, well, it's just a very small sin.

You just, you know, it seems so insignificant. And therefore, you're thinking of sin sort of like a pile of ceramic pots. And they're all on the pile and you throw a baseball into the pile and you break one.

Whoops, you go on over, take it away. Who's going to know the difference? I mean, the pile is intact, basically.

But sin is much more like throwing a baseball through a window. Either the window is intact or it's shattered. And here's the point, either God is God in your life.

Either he calls the shots, you might say. Either you let him be God. It's another way to put it.

Or else you're God in your life. And we put it three ways. First of all, either your will is law and his will is advice.

Or see, his will is law and your will is advice. Let me put it another way. If you say aloe bay, when it makes sense to me, if it fits in with my opinion of what is good for me, if it fits my feelings, if you say aloe bay, if what you're saying is, my will, my wisdom, my goals, sit in judgment on God's.

If you say aloe bay, no matter what, aloe bay, if it kills me, aloe bay, if I'm the last person on the earth that does, aloe bay, no matter what it costs me, aloe bay, whether I understand it or not, aloe bay, whether it's practical or not, aloe bay, whether it's relevant or not, then and only then. You're saying God's wisdom, God's will and God's goals sit in judgment on mine. Now it's one of the other.

There's no in between. It's not like you break a couple of rules, but basically the piles intact. It's a principle of God's godness.

Who's the shepherd? Who's the sheep? Who's the Lord?

Who's the servant? Who's will is law? And who's will is advice?

It's one of the other. There's nothing in the middle. Nothing at all.

And this is what's so interesting. It says, if you decide you're going to be the call to shots in your own life, this isn't so much, hey, this is not so much, for example, cheating on a test. This is essentially living for your own happiness, living for your own comfort, living for your own glory.

Just making your decisions without reference to God, just ignoring God is that you've broken the glass. You've bent your soul. Nothing's going to work.

If you read through here, and I don't have time to do it, your emotions won't work. It tells you that. Your intellect won't work.

He was steamed him not. We thought he was zero. That's literally what it means.

Your emotions don't work. When you look at him, you don't desire him. I mean, nothing will work.

Now, one more before we go on to the last point. That's why he came. He came because there's some undeleteable, seemingly insignificant thing on the external microchip of every human heart, which is, I want to be God.

I want to be my own God. Me first, which is the cause of all the misery. That's why he came.

But one little thing. Think about this for a second. Christians are often accused of having their head in the sand intellectually, and by the way, it's true.

However, it's awfully easy, more than easy. The average person when it comes to their relationship with God definitely has his or her head in the sand. Here's why I want to put it.

Here's how I want to put it. According to this. If God's your maker.

If God made you. If you've been created by God. You owe him everything.

Absolutely everything. You owe it to have him be the one who calls all shots. Right?

Otherwise, you're bent. Otherwise, it's terrible. It's wrong.

It's unfair. It's stupid. You're going to die as certainly as those shaped sheep that think they can be shepherds will die.

So, if, see, if God made you, then you have to go all the way with him. Totally is God being number one. If he did not make you, then it's warranted for you to go your own way.

If you haven't been created by anybody, of course you belong to yourself. But then your life's meaningless. And if you're not created, you're an accident.

You came without purpose into the world. No matter what you do, everything's going to rot. Everything's going to burn up.

You do make any difference. And if your origin isn't significant, and your destiny isn't significant, have the intellectual guts to admit your life isn't significant, and this is all you've got. If you've been made, you have to give everything to him.

If you haven't given everything to him, then your life is utterly meaningless. And that's it. You're either bent or you're meaningless.

It's one or the other. And almost nobody thinks like that. Because almost nobody will say, if everybody I know that says, well, I have to decide what's right or wrong for me.

They won't say, well, that means my life is utterly meaningless. Or I am bending myself against the very God who made me. You don't do that.

What do you say? Well, you just go along with what everybody else is saying. You're not thinking it out at all.

You're heads in the sand. Now, you're unconscious. Know something about it.

It's something here. Am I still on? Yeah.

I think I kicked something, pardon me. You're unconscious. Your semi-conscious knows.

It's why your Garcals at the sickness under death. Sarger calls it nausea. Deep down inside, you know this.

Either there's a God now. I'm absolutely everything. Or I don't.

I can be my own maker. And there's no meaning for anything. One or the other.

Well, almost nobody thinks that out. You don't want to think it out. But I'm respectfully asking you to think it out.

现在，请听 Keller 博士继续今天的教导。如果你认为罪就是打破规则，上帝的规则，这确实是一个视角，但如果我们从这里开始，问题就出现了。让我们假设你只是在考试中作弊了。结果你被别人也给作弊了。

这就像是抢劫。所以当你想到罪时，你可以认为它只是一个很小的罪，似乎无关紧要。因此，你可能会把罪想象成一堆陶瓷碗，你扔一个棒球进去，打碎了一个。“ Oops，” 你去拿走它，谁知道呢？

毕竟，堆里的碗还是完好无损的。但罪更像是用棒球打破窗户。要么窗户完好无损，要么彻底破碎。**关键是，要么在你的生命中上帝是上帝。**

要么他说了算。或者说，要么你让他做主。这是另一种说法。要么就是你在你的生命中做了上帝。

我们有三种方式来表达这一点。首先，要么你的意志是法律，他的意志是建议。或者反过来，他的意志是法律，你的意志是建议。让我换个说法。

如果你说“照我说的做”，当它符合我的观点、适合我感觉良好的时候，或者说，当你所说的只是我的智慧、我的目标在评判上帝的时候， 如果你们说“啊力湾”，不管怎样，啊力湾；哪怕要了我的命，啊力湾；哪怕我是世界上最后一个这么做的，啊力湾；无论代价多大，啊力湾；无论我懂不懂，啊力湾；无论有没有用，啊力湾；无论有没有意义，啊力湾，那么，只有这样。你才在说上帝的智慧、上帝的心意和上帝的目标在审判我的。现在轮到另一方了。没有中间地带。

不是你违反了几条规则，但大体上还是完整的。这是上帝神性的原则。谁是牧者？谁是羊？

谁是主？谁是仆人？谁的意志是法律？谁的意志是建议？

没有中间地带。一点都没有。这非常有趣。它说，如果你决定自己在生活中做决策者，这不是说，比如说作弊考试。

这是指为了自己的幸福、舒适和荣耀而生活，不参考上帝，无视上帝。你已经打破了玻璃，扭曲了灵魂。什么都不会起作用。如果你读到这里，我来不及细说了，你的感情不会起作用。

它告诉你这一点。你的理智也不会起作用。他生气了。我们认为他是零。

这就是它的意思。你的感情不起作用。当你看他时，你不会渴望他。也就是说，什么都不会起作用。

再补充一点，我们继续最后一个要点。他之所以来，是因为人类心中有一个无法删除、看似无关紧要的东西——我想做上帝。我想成为自己的上帝。我第一，这是所有苦难的根源。

这就是他来的缘由。但有一点需要注意的是，想一下这个。基督徒常常被认为在智力上脑袋在沙子里，顺便说一句，这确实是真的。然而，一个普通人，在他们与上帝的关系中，脑袋在沙子里更容易，非常容易。

我想这样表达： 根据这一点，如果上帝是你的创造者。如果上帝创造了你，如果你是上帝创造的，那么你欠他一切。绝对的一切。你必须让他成为掌控一切的人。

否则呢？否则就是扭曲的。否则就是糟糕透顶。就是错误的。

不公平。愚蠢。你终将死去，就像那些自以为可以当牧羊人的绵羊一样。所以，如果上帝创造了你，你就必须完全顺服他。

上帝必须是你的第一位。如果不是上帝创造你，那么你可以走自己的路。如果你没有人创造，当然你属于你自己。但那样的话，你的生命毫无意义。

而且如果你没有被创造，那你就是一场意外。你毫无目的地来到这个世界。无论你做什么，一切都将腐朽，一切都会化为灰烬。你根本没有任何区别。

如果起源不重要，而归宿也不重要，那就勇敢承认你的生命毫无意义，这便是你拥有的全部。如果你是被创造的，你就必须把一切都献给他。如果你没有把一切都献给他，那么你的生命就是彻底无意义的。就是这样。

要么扭曲，要么无意义。两者必居其一。几乎没有人这样思考。因为几乎没有人会说：如果我认识的所有人都认为，他们有权自己决定什么是正确或错误的。

他们不会说：**这意味着我的生命毫无意义，或者我在对抗创造我的上帝。**你不会这样做。你会说什么？嗯，你就跟着大家走吧。

根本没有认真思考过。你的头脑还是在沙子里。现在，你是无意识的。但你知道一些事情。

这里有些东西。我还在吗？是的。我好像踢到了什么东西，原谅我。

你是无意识的。你半清醒的状态知道这一点。这就是为什么你的加尔克人在死亡的病痛下挣扎。萨格尔称之为恶心。

在内心深处，你都知道这一点。要么现在有上帝。我是绝对的一切。要么没有。

我可以自己创造自己，而任何事情都没有意义。两者必居其一。几乎没有人这样思考过。你不想这样思考。

但我要恭敬地请求你认真思考一下。

## 他做了什么：替代性救赎 / What He Did: Substitution as Salvation

Now, lastly. See? Who he is?

Why he came? What he did. Now, what we have here is one more essence.

You know, the essence of who he is, Arm Noble Lord. The essence of sin. What is the essence of sin?

Didn't really define it. Did I? The essence of sin is us substituting ourselves for God.

Putting ourselves into places where only God deserves to be in your own life. Well, then what's the essence of salvation? And the answer is right here in verse 4, 5 and 6.

It's God substituting himself for us. This is the meaning of life, substitution. Look, first of all, in verse 4, it says, pardon me, verse 5, he was pierced for our transgressions.

He was crushed for our iniquities. Now, in Hebrew doesn't say 4. He just wouldn't work in English to put out exactly what it says in Hebrew.

It says he was pierced from our transgressions. He was crushed from our iniquities. And that's the Hebrew way of saying he was crushed as a result of.

See, it's what it's actually that he was pierced as a result. Wait, wait, wait. Our transgression, consequence, goes to him.

See, our iniquity, consequence, goes to him. And then, look down here, verse 11. Whoops, sorry, look over here, verse 11.

It says, by his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many. My righteous servant will justify many. You know what the word justification means?

You think about it. In English, it works. What if you make a statement, and I don't like it, or I'm upset by it, or I don't, that's why I come to you, and I say, you made a statement, justify that statement.

And you say, well, let me explain, and you make some explanations. And I say, oh, fine. Okay, good.

You justified. That's fine. What did you just do?

Did you change the statement? No. You didn't change it a bit.

You didn't change the word. You didn't change the letter. But what you did do, you changed my attitude toward it.

You changed my relationship to it. When it says that our transgressions have gone, have, have, have a cause, and the cause of the transgressions have gone to him. It's also saying he is of the perfect life, and the cause, the consequence of that perfect life, will come to us.

Just as God, here, the essence of being a Christian. What's the essence of being a Christian? Trying hard to live like Jesus?

No, that's a consequence. In fact, in most of our cases, that's an accident. What's the essence?

When Jesus, you know, a second Corinthians 521, is absolutely summarizing all of Isaiah 53, here's how it goes. God made him sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him. What does that mean?

What does it mean to say Jesus Christ became sin? Does that mean he became sinful? No.

Does that mean he became wicked and nasty and awful? No. What does it mean?

It means he was treated by God as if he'd done every bloody thing the humanity had ever done. Well, then what does it mean to become righteous in him? I know what most of you think.

You say, I want to become a Christian. I'm going to have to clean up my act. Well, yes, you are, but that's not the essence.

What makes you a Christian is that the moment you believe in him and you say, Father, for Jesus' sake, because of what he did in history, except me. That moment, according to this, it means every God gives you credit for absolutely everything that Jesus ever did. One of the things that comes out in here, and you say, how could that be?

Let me show you. One of the things that comes out in here is the voluntariness of Jesus' death. Well, the voluntariness of his death comes out when it says, he took up our infirmities, very active word.

He picked them off of us in a sense and put them on himself. Or all these places where he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth. What is all that?

He's voluntary. He voluntarily died. Well, you say plenty of people voluntarily died.

No, they haven't. Nobody voluntarily died by Jesus. Let me say, have there people who, given their lives for others, those people who committed suicide?

No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. They voluntarily...

No. What they did was they chose, when did I? They didn't choose to die.

You can't choose to die. You're going to die. They choose how to die.

They didn't choose to die. Even when you say, I choose to die and you commit suicide, you're still a victim of death. You haven't chosen to die.

You were going to die. You could never have stopped it. You could never have held it off.

Jesus is the only person who ever died who wasn't a victim of death. Jesus is the only person who ever died voluntarily. The only person who didn't have to die.

Ever have to die. Jesus was beautiful and he voluntarily became ugly. Jesus was unlimited and he voluntarily became limited.

Jesus was eternal and he voluntarily died. It was an act of supreme authority. That's the reason why one guy says Jesus Christ alone.

His death was like this. It's almost as if Jesus Christ took his body in one hand and his soul in one hand and tore himself apart. He says, I lay my life down according to all my own accord.

Now what does that mean? Well, it means something for your heart and something for your understanding and then we're going to end. Here's the thing it means for your heart.

最后一点。看看他是谁？为什么他来？

做了什么。现在，我们这里有一个更本质的东西。你知道吗，谁是那位尊贵的主 Arm Noble Lord 的本质是什么？罪的本质又是什么呢？

没有真正定义它吧？罪的本质是我们用自己取代了神。把我们在生活中本不应属于的位置填满，只有神才配得上。那么救赎的本质是什么？

答案就在第4、5和6节里。这就是生命的真谛——替代。看，在第5节中说：请原谅我，其实是第6节，他因我们的过犯被 pierce，因我们的罪孽被压伤。在希伯来文中并没有“4”这个数字，用英文表达时无法完全对应原文的意思。

它说的是他因我们的过犯而被 pierce，因我们的罪孽而被压伤。这就是希伯来文的表达方式——他是因后果而受苦。你看，我们的过犯带来的结果都归于他；我们的罪孽带来的结果也都归于他。然后往下看，第11节。

抱歉，错了，请看这里，第11节： 凭他的知识，我的公义仆人将使多人称义。我的公义仆人将使多人称义。你知道“称义”这个词是什么意思吗？想想吧。

在英文中它很通顺。如果你说了一句话，我不同意或者不高兴，我就来找你，说：“你刚才说的话，请解释一下。” 你说：“好的，让我来解释。”然后我说：“好吧，可以了。

”这就叫“称义”。那你做了什么？你改变了陈述的内容吗？没有。

一点都没有改变。你没有改变任何一个单词或字母。但你确实改变了我对这句话的态度和关系。当它说我们的过犯带来的结果归于他时，也就是在说他是完全的生命，而这个完全生命的后果将会归于我们。

正如神在这里所描述的，这就是成为基督徒的本质。那么，成为基督徒的本质是什么呢？尽力像耶稣那样生活？不，这只是结果。

事实上，在大多数情况下，这只是一个意外。本质是什么？当耶稣在哥林多后书5:21中绝对总结了以赛亚书53章的内容时，情况就是这样：神使他成为罪，虽然他本无罪，好叫我们因他的缘故成为神的义。这句话意味着什么？

说耶稣基督成了罪，并不意味着他变得有罪了吗？不。这是否意味着他变得邪恶、恶劣和糟糕？不。

那意味着什么呢？**这意味着神对待他是如同他做了人类所做的一切坏事一样。**那么，成为他在我们里面公义又意味着什么呢？我知道你们大多数人的想法是： 你说：“我想成为一名基督徒，我必须整顿我的行为。

” 是的，你确实需要这样做，但这不是本质。使你成为基督徒的是，在那一刻你相信了他，并且你说：“父啊，因耶稣的缘故，因为他在历史上的所作所为，赦免我吧。” 在这一刻，根据这段话的意思，神会给你所有的功劳，就像耶稣所做的每一件事一样。这里还有一件事会让你疑惑：这怎么可能？

让我来解释一下。这里显示了耶稣死亡的自愿性。他的自愿性体现在他“担当我们的罪疾”，这是一个非常主动的行为。他仿佛从我们身上拿走了这些疾病，并自己承担它们。

或者所有那些提到他不开口的地方，他不开口，他不开口，他不开口。这代表什么？这是自愿的。耶稣自愿地死去了。

你可能会说：很多人自愿死去。不，不是这样的。没有人像耶稣那样自愿死去。让我再强调一下，有没有人为别人献出生命的人？

那些自杀的人呢？不，不，不，等等一下。等等一下。他们自愿... 不对。

他们选择的是什么时候死亡，并非如何死亡。你不能选择何时死亡，你会死；你可以选择如何面对死亡。他们并没有选择死亡。即使你说我要死，然后自杀，你仍然是死亡的受害者，并没有真正选择死亡。

你们本该死去，根本无法阻止，也无法延缓。耶稣是唯一一个不是被死亡控制而自愿死去的人。耶稣是唯一一个可以自由选择死亡的人。耶稣美丽无比，却甘愿变得丑陋；耶稣无所不能，却甘愿受限制；耶稣永恒不死，却甘愿舍命。

这是他行使至高无上权力的表现。因此有人说：唯有耶稣基督。他的死是这样的。仿佛耶稣基督一手拿着自己的身体，一手拿着自己的灵魂，将自己撕裂开来。

他说：“我按照自己的意愿交出我的生命。” 这又意味着什么呢？**这意味着你的心灵和理解中的某些东西。**现在我们要结束了，但这里有一件事需要你思考。

## 十字架上不可摧毁的爱 / The Unbreakable Love of the Cross

The heart. What held Jesus to the cross? Think about it.

What held Him to the cross? I mean, there's a lot of people who died for other people. Those that they can move you.

Something deep in our soul tells us substitution is the meaning of life. Whenever you get near it in a story, you know, the movie version of the screenplay of the last of the Mohicans. Remember, the women are about to be killed and incomes, you know, you know, Daniel Dei Lewis, LaLonga Caribbean, you know, Nathaniel Poe, at least in the story.

And he comes and he says to the... Mary says to the Indian chief, me for her. You see, me for them, me for them.

Kill me instead of them. But he doesn't know French. You see, and he doesn't...

Or he doesn't know the language. So he has to do it through an interpreter. Remember who the interpreter is?

Duncan. Duncan, the spurned shooter of one of the women. And Duncan starts speaking, but Duncan says, me for them.

And they string Duncan up, remember? And they kill him? So they can flee.

And you watch that? Something moves you. This is the meaning of life.

This is something amazing. Or, you know, tale of two cities. Charles Dickens fascinating place.

Cecidney Carton is in love with the woman, but she marries Charles Darnay. But Charles Darnay is soon in prison and he's going to be executed. He's going to go to the guillotine.

And Cidney Carton, who looks quite a bit like Charles Darnay, comes into see Charles Darnay and says, I'm switching with you. What? And he basically knocks the man out.

And he puts on the cond... You see, he puts on the condemned man's clothes. The condemned man is given the free man's clothes.

And Cidney Carton dies. And by the way, near the very end, Cidney Carton, who's playing like his Charles Darnay, he's in line, he's ready to go to the guillotine, and there's a woman, there's a young girl who's there, and says, hey, you know me, I used to be with you back in here and back in there, and she looks up, and she realizes it's not Charles Darnay. And her face goes white.

And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yeah. And she says, hold my hand.

Somebody like you, I think I'll be able to face anything with somebody like you. And to see, what's going on there? There's nothing more moving than that.

It's the opposite of sin. And the opposite of sin is me first. Salvation is you first.

The essence of sin is, see, your life for mine. The essence of salvation is my life for yours. And when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross, what was holding him there?

His love for you, nothing else, nothing else at all. And that means, no matter what you do, you couldn't possibly break his love for you. Think about it.

What did it take? It took God's wrath. It took punishment.

It took all this stuff. And now, some days, you're sitting around and you're saying, I've been so inconsistent. I've been so stupid.

I've been so foolish. I've done all this. I've done that.

I wonder whether Jesus is going to give up on me. Your inconsistency, your foolishness, is going to break poor Jesus' little love when this wouldn't break it? This love for you took everything hell could give and it didn't give up.

He was absolutely voluntary. He gave himself for you. That's something your heart's got to know.

It's a strong love. You couldn't possibly wear it out. You couldn't possibly wear it through it.

心灵。是什么让耶稣钉在十字架上？是什么让耶稣钉在十字架上呢？想想看，有很多人为别人而死，那些故事能触动人心。

我们的灵魂深处有一种感觉：替代是生活的意义。当你接近这个主题时，比如电影《最后一个莫希干人》中的情节，记得那个场景中，女人即将被杀，丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯、兰格卡里比、内森·李奥纳多等人出场。玛丽对印第安酋长说：“我替她。”你看，“我替他们”，“我替他们”。

杀了我代替他们。但他说的不是法语，所以需要翻译。记得是谁做了翻译吗？是邓肯。

邓肯是其中一个女人的抛弃者。邓肯开始说话，但他只说了“我替他们”。然后他们把邓肯吊起来，记住了吗？他们杀死了他，这样别的人就可以逃走了。

你看过那场景吗？这触动了你的心灵。这就是生活的意义。这是多么神奇的事情。

或者就像《双城记》中的情节，查尔斯·狄更斯的精彩故事。查尔斯·达奈爱上了那个女人，但她却嫁给了西德尼·卡尔顿。但很快，查尔斯·达奈就被关进了监狱，并且即将被处决，将要走向断头台。而与查尔斯·达奈相貌相似的西德尼·卡尔顿来到监狱探望他，说：“我要和你交换。

”什么？然后他基本上把那个人打晕了。接着他穿上……你看，他穿上了被判刑人的衣服。被判处死刑的人得到了自由人的衣服。

西德尼·卡尔顿最终死去。顺便提一下，在即将走向断头台的时候，扮演查尔斯·达奈的西德尼·卡尔顿旁边有一个年轻女孩，她说：“嘿，你认得我吗？我们曾经在一起过。”她抬头一看，发现不是查尔斯·达奈。

她的脸色变得苍白。她问：“你是为他而死的吗？”他说：“是的。”然后她说道：“握住我的手。

” 像你这样的人，我认为有了你，我可以面对任何事情。看看那是什么样的情景？没有比这更感人的了。这是罪的反面。

而罪的反面就是“我先”。救赎就是“你先”。罪的本质在于，你的生命为我的牺牲。救赎的本质在于，我的生命为你。

当耶稣基督在十字架上受难时，是什么支撑着他？是他对你的爱，除此之外别无他物。**这意味着无论你做了什么，都无法破坏他对你的爱。**想想看。

需要什么？需要上帝的愤怒，需要惩罚，需要这一切。有些时候，你坐在那里自责：“我太不一致了。”“我太愚蠢了。

”“我太愚昧了。”“我做了这么多。” 你会怀疑耶稣是否会放弃你吗？你的不一致性、你的愚蠢，是否会让可怜的耶稣的小爱破碎？

这种对你的爱连地狱所能给予的一切都无法让它放弃。那是完全自愿的行为。他为了你牺牲了自己。这是你的心必须知道的事情。

## 十字架作为生命的模式 / The Cross as the Pattern for Life

But then, here's the last thing for your understanding. This is not only something you need to know if you need to know this for your understanding. Jesus Christ essentially fulfilled the law of God twice when he came to earth because he didn't just die to fulfill the law.

He lived an incredible life. In that, he voluntarily gave himself for someone else. He actually did love his neighbor.

You see, completely. Another way to put it is this. I don't know how much it costs because I have made some of you know.

There's the law of the stoplight in New York City. And there's two ways to satisfy the law of the stoplight. One is stop.

The other is pay $75, I think. Either way, you satisfy the law of the stoplight. How do you satisfy the law of God?

Love your God with all your heart's whole strength and love your neighbor as yourself? Or pay the penalty? In Jesus Christ, as he was paying the penalty, was loving God with all his heart's whole strength and my and his neighbor as himself.

So he fulfilled the law of God twice. You see, he took our sins. That leaves his record for us, his perfect record for us.

Listen, put it this way. What does this mean to you? It means the meaning of your life is the cross in two ways.

Unless the cross makes sense to you, life won't make sense. Unless you begin to see, first of all, through the cross, you're not going to have to worry anymore so much about your comfort because the great disease has been taken away from you forever. You don't have to worry that much about your looks because the great beauty has been put on you forever.

You don't have to worry that much about your reputation because the only one who matters loves you. What does that mean? It means as you go out into the world, this stuff that used to bother you just doesn't.

Suffering will happen. You'll get sick, but the great disease you see has been cured. You'll get abused, but you see, the great reputation is yours.

And so what happens is that you move on through the cross not only gives you an emotional well to handle the problems of life, but then secondly, it gives you the wisdom to see, look, this is the way Jesus came. This is the weakness of the arm of the Lord. So often, the best things that happen in life are because of through weakness and suffering and trouble and difficulty.

Until the cross is the joy of your life, life won't make sense to you. Until the cross makes sense, life won't make sense. And then, not only is it true that the cross will make sense of your life, the cross then becomes the pattern for your life.

Here's what's so wonderful. You feel so rich if you understand the cross that you start to live like Jesus. You basically say, not your life or mine, my life for you, you spend yourself.

You know what's interesting about this? Suffering and oppression, he is oppressed. He is the victim of injustice.

He is cut off in the land of living. He's the recipient of a violent debt. Most of us in this room are never going to experience any of that kind of injustice.

Oh, what's so great about this is this. If you don't believe in God, injustice and suffering is a horrible problem, you know why? It's a tremendous mystery.

It's a mystery why you're upset. Because you see, if there is no God, then the strong eating of the weak is utterly natural, totally natural. And what why aren't you God for insisting it should be some other way?

This is the way it is. So he says, suffering and injustice is a terrible problem if you don't believe in God. But if you do believe in God, then it becomes a terrible problem, because why doesn't he stop it?

But of all the gods that we have and all the different religions that are at least presented to us, there's only one God who's been involved. So when any other God says, I've got good reasons, you know, it sounds pretty hollow. But when you have a God who actually was the victim of injustice, you better trust Him.

And you better start living your life for other people who have been through the same thing. My life for yours. This is the essence of being a Christian.

Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place.

We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is, and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now. We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice, not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims.

A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives, not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord.

And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you, you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

这是一种强大的爱。你无法耗尽它，也无法穿透它。但最后，这是你需要理解的一点。这不仅仅是你需要知道的东西，耶稣基督在来到地球时实际上两次完成了上帝的律法，因为他不仅仅是为了完成律法而死。

他过了一生不可思议的生活，在那之中，他自愿为别人付出自己。他确实爱他的邻舍。你看得非常清楚。另一种说法是这样：我不知道具体要花多少钱，因为我已经让你们中的一些人知道了。

纽约市的红绿灯法则有两种满足方式。一种是停车。另一种是支付75美元左右。无论哪种方式，你都满足了红绿灯法则。

那么，你怎么才能满足上帝的律法呢？用全心全意去爱上帝，并且爱人如己？还是付出代价？在耶稣基督身上，当他付出代价时，他也是全心全意地爱上帝，并且爱人如己。

所以他两次完成了上帝的律法。你看，他承担了我们的罪孽，为我们留下了完美的记录。听我说，这样来说吧：这对你意味着什么？**这意味着你的生命的意义在于十字架的两个方面。**

除非你理解了十字架的意义，否则生活就不会有意义。除非你首先通过十字架开始看到这一点，否则你就不会那么担心自己的舒适问题，因为那最大的疾病已经被永远治愈了。你就不会那么担心自己的外貌问题，因为唯一关心你的人已经给了你最美丽的形象。你就不会那么担心自己的名誉问题，因为真正重要的那个人爱你。

**这意味着什么呢？意味着当你走向世界时，那些曾经困扰你的事情现在不再困扰你了。**苦难会发生，你会生病，但你看，那最大的疾病已经被治愈了。你会受到虐待，但你看，那伟大的名誉属于你。

于是，你不仅通过十字架经历情感上的慰藉来应对生活中的问题，而且还能从中获得智慧，看清耶稣的道路。这正是主的软弱之处。生活中最好的事情往往是因为软弱、受苦和困难而发生的。直到你的生命中充满了十字架的意义，生活对你来说才会变得有意义。

直到你理解了十字架的意义，生活才会有意义。不仅如此，十字架不仅会为你的生命带来意义，还会成为你生命的模式。最奇妙的是，如果你真正理解了十字架，你会活得像耶稣一样丰富。你会说：“不是我的生命或你的生命，而是我的生命为你。

” 你会开始倾注自己。有趣的是，受苦和压迫，他就是被压迫的，他是不公正的受害者。他在生者之地被截断，承受暴力的债务。我们大多数人都不会经历这种不公。

哦，这真是太好了，因为如果你不相信上帝，不公正和苦难是一个可怕的问题，你知道为什么吗？因为它是一个巨大的谜团。你不明白为什么会感到愤怒，因为如果没有上帝，强者吃弱者的现象是完全自然的。你为什么要坚持它应该是另一种样子呢？

这就是事实。所以他说，如果不相信上帝，受苦和不公是一个可怕的问题。但如果相信上帝，这同样成为一个可怕的问题，为什么他不阻止它呢？在我们所知道的所有神明和各种宗教中，只有一个神真正参与其中。

因此，当其他神说他们有正当理由时，听起来很空洞。但当你有一个亲身经历过不公正的上帝时，你更应该信任祂。你也必须开始为那些经历同样事情的人生活，我的生命为你。这就是成为基督徒的本质。

让我们祷告。天父，感谢你赐给我们这次宝贵的反思机会。以某种方式来说，这也是一种很好的开始礼拜的方式，在一个新地方，我们的教会社区聚集在一起敬拜。我们看到了福音的本质、罪的本质、救赎的本质以及我们现在应该如何生活的本质。

我们感谢你赐予我们唯一的上帝——一位遭受不公的受害者而非加害者。这位上帝又如此富有，使我们可以为其他受害者付出一切；他变得虚弱，让我们看到软弱可以成为力量的方式。天父，请帮助我们理解这些真理，并将它们融入我们的生活中，不仅作为个人，而且作为这个地方敬拜社区的一员。感谢你，主。

在接下来的礼拜中，当我们向你祷告并把这些事呈献给你时，请塑造和塑造我们的心灵，使它更符合我们刚刚所见的形象——伟大的仆人耶稣基督，公义的他，在他的名下我们祷告。阿门。感谢您收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的讲道。如果您希望更多的人通过这个事工中心以福音为中心的教学和资源受到鼓励，请考虑成为《福音与生活》每月合作伙伴。
