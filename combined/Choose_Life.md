## 引言与经文宣读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. How comfortable are you when it comes to being open about your faith? This month on the podcast, Tim Keller looks at what the Bible says about having a public faith.

He shows us what it looks like to be open about our faith in a pluralistic society, in a way that creates civility and peace and meaningful dialogue with our neighbors. Good morning. The scripture this morning is taken from the Book of Deuteronomy, chapter 30, verses 11-20.

Now, what's I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven so that you have to ask who will ascend to heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it. Nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it.

No. The Word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart.

No. You may obey it. See I have set before you today life in prosperity, death and destruction.

For I command you today to love the Lord, your God, to walk in His ways and to keep His commands, decrees, and laws, then you will live and increase. And the Lord, your God, will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, then I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed.

You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you, that I have set before you life and death blessings and curses, now choose life so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord, your God, listen to His voice and hold fast to Him. So the Lord is your life, and He will give you many years.

In the land He swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is the Word of the Lord. We've been looking at the book of Deuteronomy and we've said that this is a series of sermons that Moses preached to his people right at the very end of his life, and now we really truly are at the end of the series, and we're at the end of the last of his sermons.

And in verse 16, we see that at the very, very end, he says, he's commanding, that word command means he's calling or charging his people to enter into a covenant relationship with God. So the Lord, you are God and walk in His ways, and for the last couple of weeks been looking at this, a covenant relationship with God is very personal yet binding and whole life transforming. And here at the very end, Moses is simply saying, enter that covenant relationship with God.

Now one of the most interesting things about this passage is its simplicity and its basicness. It's so basic, so straightforward. Choose.

Here's the one thing you can do. Do this. Don't do this.

This will bring this. This will bring this. So simple.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。谈到公开表达你的信仰时，你感到舒适吗？本月在播客上，提摩太·凯勒探讨圣经关于拥有公开信仰的教导。

他向我们展示在多元社会中公开信仰是什么样子，以一种能创造文明、和平和与邻舍有意义对话的方式。早上好。今早的经文摘自《申命记》第30章第11-20节。

我今日所吩咐你的诫命不是你难行的，也不是离你远的。不是在天上，使你说："谁替我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？"也不是在海外，使你说："谁替我们过海取了来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？"

这话却离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，使你可以遵行。

看哪，我今日将生与福，死与祸，陈明在你面前。

吩咐你爱耶和华你的神，遵行他的道，谨守他的诫命、律例、典章，使你可以存活，人数增多，耶和华你神就必在你所要进去得为业的地上赐福与你。倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡。

在你过约旦河进去得为业的地上，你的日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作见证，我将生死祸福陈明在你面前，所以你要拣选生命，使你和你的后裔都得存活，且爱耶和华你的神，听从他的话，专靠他，因为他是你的生命。你的日子长久也在乎他。

这样，就可以在耶和华向你列祖亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各起誓应许所赐的地上居住。这是神的话语。我们一直在查考《申命记》，我们说过这是摩西在他生命的最后向他的百姓所讲的一系列讲道，现在我们真的到了这系列讲道的末尾，到了他最后一篇讲道的结尾。

在第16节，我们看到在最后的最后，他说，他在吩咐，这个"吩咐"这个词意味着他在呼召或者说劝勉他的百姓进入与神的立约关系。所以你们要爱耶和华你们的神，遵行他的道，过去几周我们一直在查考这个，与神的立约关系是非常个人化的，却又是有约束力的，是改变整个生命的。在这里的最后，摩西只是简单地说，进入那与神的立约关系。

现在这段经文最有趣的事情之一就是它的简单性和基础性。它是如此基本，如此直截了当。选择。

这是你能做的一件事。做这个。不要做这个。

这将带来这个。那将带来那个。如此简单。

## 信仰的困难简单性 / The Difficult Simplicity of Faith

In fact, it's so simple. I actually struggled a little bit with this. I still struggle with this passage, you know why?

A preacher loves to take a hard passage and make it simple. And everybody say, oh, it's simpler than I thought. He's wonderful.

He says a wonderful teacher, okay. I actually believe that my job is to take an extremely simple passage today and actually show you its difficulty. And I believe that's what Moses is trying to show us.

Moses starts saying, look, I'm offering you this personal relationship with God. And he's actually saying, it's not too difficult. It's near you.

You don't have to go up to heaven. You don't have to go over the sea. He's actually trying to say the simplicity of what I'm telling you is its difficulty.

People miss this covenant relationship with God because it's so simple. The simplicity is its difficulty. And if you're ever going to get it, you need to come to grips with the difficult simplicity of having a personal relationship with God.

事实上，它是如此简单。实际上我在这段经文上有点挣扎。我仍然在这段经文上挣扎，你知道为什么吗？

一个传道人喜欢拿一段艰深的经文然后把它讲简单。然后每个人都说，哦，比我想的简单。他太棒了。

他是个很棒的老师，好吧。实际上我相信我的工作是拿一段极其简单的经文，然后实际上向你们展示它的难度。我相信这就是摩西试图向我们展示的。

摩西开始说，看，我在向你们提供这个与神的个人关系。他实际上在说，这并不太难。它就在你身边。

你不必上到天上。你不必过到海外。他实际上在试图说，我告诉你的这个简单性就是它的难度。

人们错过了这个与神的立约关系，因为它太简单了。这简单性就是它的难度。如果你要得到它，你需要理解与神有个人关系的这个困难的简单性。

## 神话语的欺骗性平凡 / The Deceptive Ordinariness of God's Word

Now, let's look at this difficult simplicity under three headings. We're going to see here, when it comes to this personal covenant relationship with God, its deceptive ordinariness, its threatening graciousness, and its unimaginable promise. Its deceptiveness, its deceptive pardon me, ordinariness.

Its threatening graciousness, and yet its unimaginable promise. So first, let's look at its ordinariness, which I said is deceptive. Verse 14 says, this word, this charge to enter into a personal relationship with God is near you.

And then he says, what does that mean? Well, one of the ways to understand that is verse 12. He says, it is not up in heaven so that you have to say, who will ascend into heaven and get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it.

Now ancient cultures, all ancient peoples believe that divine wisdom, divine knowledge, secrets of the universe, secrets of the meaning of life, secrets for how to live, secrets of what happens after death. The secrets of the universe are hard to find things, because God or the gods are remote and they hold their cards to their chests. The ancient legends are filled with particularly gifted pure people who in body or spirit ascend to the heavens, and they have visions, or they have visitors from other dimensions, and they get cryptic oracular utterances and they piece together the truth that only they have.

And Moses will have none of it. When he says, you don't have to go up to heaven to get this, what is he saying? He says because the God, with the whole book of Deuteronomy, says the God whom heaven and highest heaven cannot even contain, has come down.

He's come on down into Mount Sinai. Over and over again, Moses says, God himself came down and told you these things and spoke to you out of the fire, remember that? So what is Moses saying?

If you want the secrets of the universe, you don't have to be an expert elite scientist. Nor do you have to be incredibly sophisticated, artiste poet. You don't only get it at an exclusive retreat in Aspen.

You don't have to climb a mountain to get it, you know why? It's in virtually every hotel room drawer. It's revealed in the Bible and the Bible is everywhere.

It's the most accessible book, it's the most easy to get a hold of text, written thing and print in the whole world. It's all over the place and not only, not only don't you have to climb up to heaven, not only has it just come right down here and it's available everywhere and it's literally right under your nose is the secret of the universe, it's under your noses. You take a motel room, you take a hotel room, the secrets of the universe are in that hotel room and you didn't even know it.

It's so ordinary. But not only I think as Moses when he says it's near you means it's physically accessible. Here it is and my words, here it is and the book, here it is, but it's also intellectually accessible because of course there's many things in the Bible that are difficult to understand and we love to sit and figure out what they are but the things in the Bible says over and over and over again, the court teachings of the Bible are unbelievably accessible.

In fact let me give you a summary of the book of Deuteronomy which is all about how God wants you to live and relate to him. Here's a summary. Number one, love God and put his will ahead of your own.

Two, love your neighbors unsilfcially and put their needs ahead of your own. In other words don't look out for number one but put God in your neighbor's first and number three, you will find as a result. You will have so much of a richer life and a heart so much more full than it would have been if you had held onto your heart and held onto your life and tried to fill it yourself.

It's so simple, it's accessible, it's right there. Moses says you don't have to go up to heaven, it's right there, it's ordinary, everybody knows it's all around you. It's in your hotel room, the secrets of the universe, now what's the problem?

It's deceptive and it's deceptive in two ways. There are two ways, in fact, well for the only two kinds of people in the world it's deceptive. First of all, there's people who don't believe or have trouble believing biblical faith, they don't like it or they have trouble with it, they've got difficulties.

One of the reasons is the deceptive simplicity. People who don't believe it very often are deceived by the simplicity, why? Well, guess what?

Modern people have every bit the same problem that the ancients had. We think if something's really, really important, some insights really important, it's got to be brilliant and sophisticated and cutting edge, and new and sexy. Let me tell you, the Bible is not any of those things, but there's always something, but boy I'll tell you, cautionary tale for me has been in September 9th, New York Times city section just two weeks ago.

There was an article about the last institute in Manhattan that trains psychiatrists in psychoanalysis, Freudian psychoanalysis. The last institute, the trains, therapists in Freudian psychoanalysis, they were talking about it, and they've mentioned that even just say 30 years ago, 40 years ago there were dozens and dozens in Manhattan. One of the reasons I was so intrigued by that was because I know, when I got here like 20 years ago, and I would talk to New Yorkers who at the time were saying their 50s or 60s, what they told me was that in the middle of the century, every New Yorker who was anybody, anyone who was savvy, anyone who was with at all went to analysis two or three times a week for years and years and years, and everybody knew this is it, this is how we're going to get into our hearts, this is the whole issue, this is it, and if you don't understand this, you're just out of it, and now it's dead, it's an eclipse, it is, you know, it is so unsexy, and yet guess what, the gospel's on every street corner, but there's something else coming, right?

现在，让我们在三个标题下来看这个困难的简单性。我们将在这里看到，当涉及到这个与神的个人立约关系时，它有欺骗性的平凡性，它有威胁性的恩典性，以及它不可想象的应许。它的欺骗性，它欺骗性的——抱歉——平凡性。

它威胁性的恩典性，以及它不可想象的应许。所以首先，让我们看它的平凡性，我说这是欺骗性的。第14节说，这话，这个进入与神个人关系的呼召就在你身边。

然后他说，那是什么意思？嗯，理解这个的方式之一是第12节。他说，不是在天上，使你说："谁替我们上天取下来，使我们听见可以遵行呢？"

现在古代文化，所有古代民族都相信神圣的智慧、神圣的知识、宇宙的奥秘、生命意义的奥秘、如何生活的奥秘、死后发生什么的奥秘。宇宙的奥秘是很难找到的东西，因为神或众神是遥远的，他们把自己的牌藏在胸前。古代传说充满了特别有天赋的纯洁的人，他们在身体或灵魂上升到诸天，他们有异象，或者他们有来自其他维度的访客，他们得到神秘的神谕式的话语，然后他们拼凑出只有他们才有的真理。

而摩西完全不接受这个。当他说，你不必上天去取它，他在说什么？他说，因为那位神，整本《申命记》说，那位连天和天上的天都不能容纳的神，已经降下来了。

他降到西奈山上。一次又一次，摩西说，神自己降下来告诉你们这些事，从火中对你们说话，记得吗？所以摩西在说什么？

如果你想要宇宙的奥秘，你不必是一个专家精英科学家。你也不必是极其复杂的艺术家诗人。你不是只能在阿斯彭的独家静修会上得到它。

你不必爬山去得到它，你知道为什么吗？它几乎在每个酒店房间的抽屉里。它在圣经中被启示出来，圣经无处不在。

它是最容易获得的书，它是全世界最容易拿到的文本、书面的东西和印刷品。它到处都是，不仅如此，不仅你不必爬到天上，不仅它就这样降下来这里，它到处都有，它实际上就在你的鼻子底下，宇宙的奥秘就在你的鼻子底下。你住一个汽车旅馆房间，你住一个酒店房间，宇宙的奥秘就在那个酒店房间里，而你甚至都不知道。

它是如此平凡。但我认为不仅如此，摩西当他说它在你身边时，意思是它在物理上是可获得的。它在这里，在我的话语中，在这本书中，在这里，但它在智力上也是可获得的，因为当然圣经中有许多难以理解的事情，我们喜欢坐下来弄清楚它们是什么，但圣经一遍又一遍反复说的事情，圣经的核心教导是令人难以置信地容易获得的。

事实上，让我给你一个《申命记》的总结，这本书全是关于神想要你如何生活和与他相关。这是一个总结。第一，爱神，把他的旨意放在你自己的旨意之前。

第二，无私地爱你的邻舍，把他们的需要放在你自己的需要之前。换句话说，不要只顾自己，而是把神和你的邻舍放在首位，第三，结果你会发现。你会有一个丰富得多的生命，一颗比你如果紧紧抓住你的心、紧紧抓住你的生命并试图自己填满它时更加充实的心。

它是如此简单，它是可获得的，它就在那里。摩西说你不必上天，它就在那里，它是平凡的，每个人都知道它在你周围到处都是。它在你的酒店房间里，宇宙的奥秘，现在问题是什么？

它是欺骗性的，它以两种方式是欺骗性的。有两种方式，事实上，嗯，对于世界上仅有的两种人来说它是欺骗性的。首先，有些人不相信或者很难相信圣经信仰，他们不喜欢它或者他们对它有困难，他们有难处。

其中一个原因就是这欺骗性的简单性。不相信它的人很多时候被这简单性所欺骗，为什么？嗯，你猜怎么着？

现代人和古人有完全一样的问题。我们认为如果某样东西真的非常重要，某个洞见真的很重要，它必须是辉煌的、复杂的、前沿的、新的和性感的。让我告诉你，圣经不是这些东西中的任何一个，但总是有什么东西，但是天哪我告诉你，对我来说的一个警世故事是在9月9日的《纽约时报》城市版，就在两周前。

有一篇文章关于曼哈顿最后一个培训精神病医生进行精神分析的学院，弗洛伊德式精神分析。最后一个学院，培训治疗师进行弗洛伊德式精神分析的，他们在谈论它，他们提到甚至就在30年前、40年前，曼哈顿有几十个这样的学院。我对此如此着迷的原因之一是因为我知道，当我大约20年前到这里时，我会和当时五六十岁的纽约人交谈，他们告诉我在世纪中叶，每一个纽约人，任何有身份的人，任何精明的人，任何跟得上潮流的人都会一周两三次去做分析，持续多年，每个人都知道这就是它，这就是我们如何进入我们的内心的方式，这是整个问题，这就是它，如果你不理解这个，你就完全跟不上时代了，而现在它死了，它被日食了，它是，你知道，它如此不性感，然而你猜怎么着，福音在每个街角，但还有别的东西要来，对吗？

## 警惕简单性：勒尚邦的例子 / Beware the Simplicity: Le Chambon's Example

Beware the deceptive simplicity of biblical faith. It really throws people who are having trouble believing it, but guess what, the simplicity of our faith throws just as much those of us who do believe it. You look at it, well what is the heart of it?

Well, you know, the heart of it is, you know, Carl Bart actually said it this way, Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so, there it is, or put it another way is you're saved by God's grace, and the New Testament adds through the sacrifice of Christ, and you look at that and you say, okay, I've heard that, I've heard that, I know it, I got it, I got it, and it's so simple, almost nobody grasped the radical implications of it. Walter Brogiman wrote a commentary on Deuteronomy that I use, I've been using during this series of sermons, and in what, on this passage where he sees the place where Moses says, this word is not beyond you, it's near you, you know, it's simple, it's accessible, and Brogiman, and that place in his commentary tells this fascinating story, true story, and here's what he says, another illustration of how plain and simple God's word is, is the account of the evangelical Christian community of Le Chambon in France during World War 2, that hid Jews during Nazi efforts at extermination. The people of the mountain village, under the direction of evangelical church and pastor, saved the lives of an estimated three to 5,000 Jews under circumstances extremely dangerous.

The state of Israel 1990 recognized the entire village as righteous among the nations for their remarkable compassion and bravery. So they must have been unusually courageous and noble and insightful, no? After the war, a Jewish adult who was kept alive there as a child returned and interviewed his protectors about their reasons for taking such risky actions on his behalf, he was trying to figure out, you know, what was the secret?

To his surprise, one after the other all merely shrugged their shoulders, literally, and said it seemed to be an obvious implication of their faith in Jesus. They had no dramatic explanations, their actions stem from the very center of their embrace of the gospel of the sacrificial love of Jesus, and it was enough. Now what Bergman's saying, and it's a powerful point, this account begs a question.

The center of the core of the Christian faith, Jesus Christ gave his life, sacrifice his life, to save, love, and forgive people who didn't believe in him, who were rejecting him, right? So this little group of French evangelicals in this little mountain village said, well, if Jesus did that for us, surely we should at least risk our lives to save these people whether they believe like we do or not. Just a logical implication of what, of the basic Christian faith, the basic Christian message, right?

Didn't everybody in Europe know the basic Christian message? Hasn't everybody in Europe seen crucifix? Hasn't everybody in Europe, you know, known the basic story?

And why didn't they all do that? And the answer is, it's too simple for us. So you think it's so simple, and it is so simple, but the implications are so vast, and because we look and so, it's simple, we don't think out the implications, right?

Dear friends, do not be deceived by the ordinaryness of what the Bible says about this subject, not have a personal relationship with God. If you're exploring Christianity, please don't be offended by simplicity and its ordinaryness. And if you're a Christian and you say, oh, I understand the gospel, I get the gospel, that just proves you don't.

It's difficulty, it's simplicity, it's simplicity, it's difficulty. And you really don't understand it until you really grasp that. Secondly, though, that's not all, that's part of this difficult simplicity.

要警惕圣经信仰的欺骗性简单性。它真的让那些难以相信它的人困惑，但你猜怎么着，我们信仰的简单性同样让那些确实相信它的人困惑。你看它，嗯，它的核心是什么？

嗯，你知道，它的核心是，你知道，卡尔·巴特实际上是这样说的，耶稣爱我，我知道，因为圣经告诉我，就是这样，或者换句话说，你是因神的恩典而得救的，《新约》又加上通过基督的牺牲，你看着那个，你说，好吧，我听过了，我听过了，我知道，我明白了，我明白了，它是如此简单，几乎没有人抓住了它的激进含义。沃尔特·布鲁格曼写了一本《申命记》注释，我一直在使用，在这一系列讲道中我一直在使用，在什么，在这段经文上，他看到摩西说的地方，这话不是离你太远，它就在你身边，你知道，它是简单的，它是可获得的，布鲁格曼在他注释的那个地方讲了这个引人入胜的故事，真实的故事，这是他说的，另一个关于神的话语多么简单明了的例证是二战期间法国勒尚邦的福音派基督徒社区的记载，该社区在纳粹试图灭绝犹太人期间藏匿犹太人。这个山村的人们，在福音派教会和牧师的带领下，在极其危险的情况下拯救了估计三到五千名犹太人的生命。

以色列国在1990年认可整个村庄为"国际义人"，因为他们非凡的同情心和勇气。所以他们一定是异常勇敢、高尚和有洞察力的，不是吗？战后，一位被保护在那里的犹太成年人，他小时候在那里被保护着，回来采访了他的保护者，询问他们为何冒这样的风险为他采取行动的原因，他试图弄清楚，你知道，秘密是什么？

令他惊讶的是，一个接一个的人都只是耸了耸肩，字面意思，然后说这似乎是他们对耶稣信仰的明显含义。他们没有戏剧性的解释，他们的行动源于他们对耶稣牺牲之爱的福音的核心接受，这就够了。现在布鲁格曼说的是，这是一个有力的观点，这个记载引出了一个问题。

基督教信仰的中心和核心是什么，耶稣基督献出了他的生命，牺牲了他的生命，去拯救、爱和饶恕那些不相信他、拒绝他的人，对吗？所以这一小群法国福音派信徒在这个小山村说，嗯，如果耶稣为我们做了那个，我们当然至少应该冒生命危险去拯救这些人，无论他们是否像我们一样相信。只是什么的一个逻辑含义，基本的基督教信仰，基本的基督教信息，对吗？

欧洲的每个人不都知道基本的基督教信息吗？欧洲的每个人不都见过十字架吗？欧洲的每个人不都知道基本的故事吗？

为什么他们都没有那样做？答案是，它对我们来说太简单了。所以你认为它如此简单，它确实如此简单，但含义是如此广泛，因为我们看着，所以，它很简单，我们不去思考含义，对吗？

亲爱的朋友们，不要被圣经关于这个主题所说的平凡性所欺骗，不要与神有个人关系。如果你在探索基督教，请不要被简单性和它的平凡性所冒犯。如果你是基督徒，你说，哦，我理解福音，我明白福音，那只是证明你不明白。

它的难度，它的简单性，它的简单性，它的难度。直到你真正抓住这一点，你才真正理解它。然而，第二，这还不是全部，这是这个困难简单性的一部分。

## 恩典的威胁性恩慈 / The Threatening Graciousness of Grace

Secondly, there's a threatening graciousness to this. Now, you see, we said, when Moses says, this is near you, in the sense of you don't have to go to heaven to get it, because it's revealed in the Bible. But now here's another thought.

He says, what I am commanding you today, verse 11, is not too difficult for you, or beyond your reach, why? It is not beyond the sea so that you have to ask, who shall cross the sea to get it? Now, the sea is a little different metaphor in the ancient world.

The sea was the symbol of chaos and destruction. In fact, Paul, we're going to get back to this, Paul quotes this whole passage in Romans 10. But when he quotes the passage in Romans 10, he calls the sea the abyss.

And of course, there's a couple of good movies, by the way. There's a good movie about the sea called the abyss. Because in ancient times, the sea was represented death, destruction.

Sea fairers were far more vulnerable than people who were on land. And so the sea represented the abyss and death. Now, what is Moses talking about here?

He says, because ancient people and the ancient legends are filled with heroic noble figures on a quest. And they go out on the sea. And the quest can be a number of things.

One of the great ones is Jason and the Argonauts. It's made in many bad, great movies. Just a great story about Jason goes off of the Argonauts and he's looking for a golden fleece that is guarded by a dragon and he gets the golden fleece.

But there's many perils. There's many riddles that he has to solve. And many perils and he comes back and he gains the kingdom.

And there are just an enormous number of these. It's almost all the cultures, all the ancient cultures, no matter where they have these strong figures who go on these quests over the sea to gain a kingdom or eternal life. My favorite Hollywoodized version of all those ancient legends, and it's a really good Hollywoodized version, is the third of the Indiana Jones movies.

You remember where Indiana Jones and his archeologist father are after the holy grail. And they believe that if they get the holy grail and you drink from it, you'll get eternal life. And they have perils and there are clues just like all the other ancient, the movie makers just understood all the other ancient pre-mythic histories.

You remember what the clues were? First, the breath of God, only the penitent man will pass. See, every one of these reminds you of another special effect.

The word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. And that's what all these stories are about.

You want salvation? See, you want eternal life? You want the kingdom?

Clues, greatness, quest, over the sea. The leap, prove your worth, and Moses will have none of it. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does.

That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller.

It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the Gospel. By reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker, or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith, it's a simple way to start a Gospel conversation or continue it.

To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Instead he says, and this is what's so interesting, he says, it's not over the sea. You don't go over the sea to get it, what? Then what is it?

He says, it's in your mouth and in your heart. So your heart is where you believe, your mouth is what you confess, and what is he saying? He says, this relationship with God is not something you achieve, it's something you receive.

It's not something that you prove your worth, you just get it. And therefore he's talking, he's saying, that this relationship with God is not something that you go to heaven to get, you go over the sea to get, you don't go on some kind of quest, you don't have to be some heroic warrior, you receive it by grace. Now this is threatening, and this is our second problem we have with it.

第二，这有一个威胁性的恩慈。现在，你看，我们说，当摩西说，这就在你身边，意思是你不必上天去取它，因为它在圣经中被启示出来。但现在这里有另一个想法。

他说，我今日所吩咐你的，第11节，不是你难行的，也不是离你远的，为什么？也不是在海外，使你说："谁替我们过海取了来？"现在，海在古代世界是一个有点不同的隐喻。

海是混乱和毁灭的象征。事实上，保罗，我们会回到这个，保罗在《罗马书》第10章引用了这整段经文。但当他在《罗马书》第10章引用这段经文时，他称海为深渊。

当然，有几部好电影，顺便说一下。有一部关于海的好电影叫做《深渊》。因为在古代，海代表死亡、毁灭。

海员比在陆地上的人更脆弱。所以海代表深渊和死亡。现在，摩西在这里说什么？

他说，因为古人和古代传说充满了英雄般的高尚人物在探索。他们出海。探索可以是很多事情。

其中一个伟大的故事是《伊阿宋和阿尔戈英雄》。它被拍成了许多糟糕的、伟大的电影。这是一个关于伊阿宋和阿尔戈英雄出去寻找被龙守护的金羊毛的伟大故事，他得到了金羊毛。

但有许多危险。有许多他必须解决的谜题。还有许多危险，他回来了，他获得了王国。

而这样的故事数量巨大。几乎所有文化，所有古代文化，无论在哪里，都有这些强大的人物进行这些探索，跨过海洋去获得王国或永生。我最喜欢的所有那些古代传说的好莱坞化版本，它是一个非常好的好莱坞化版本，是第三部《夺宝奇兵》电影。

你记得印第安纳·琼斯和他的考古学家父亲在追寻圣杯。他们相信如果他们得到圣杯并从中喝水，他们会得到永生。他们有危险，有线索，就像所有其他古代的，电影制作人就是理解所有其他古代前神话历史。

你记得线索是什么吗？首先，神的呼吸，只有悔改的人才能通过。看，每一个都让你想起另一个特效。

神的话语，只有在神的脚步中他才能前进。第三，神的道路，只有从狮子头上跳跃，他才能证明自己的价值。这就是所有这些故事的内容。

你想要救恩吗？看，你想要永生吗？你想要王国吗？

线索，伟大，探索，跨海。跳跃，证明你的价值，而摩西完全不接受这个。我们总是说福音改变一切，我们相信它真的改变一切。

这就是为什么在《福音人生》这里，八月是分享月。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众在与神放在你生命中的某人分享福音方面迈出一小步。对于那些本月向《福音人生》捐赠的人，我们会送给你两本提摩太·凯勒的《认识神的意义》。

这是一个强大的资源，探讨基督教如何在今天的世界中在情感、文化和理性上都有意义。这是我们对你的捐赠的感谢，并提供了一种你可以做一个小行动来分享福音的方式。通过与朋友一起阅读这本书，送给同事一本，或者把两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人，这是开始福音对话或继续它的一种简单方式。

要索取你的两本《认识神的意义》，只需访问gospelandlife.com/give。现在，这是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。

相反，他说，这就是如此有趣的地方，他说，它不是在海外。你不用过海去取它，什么？那它是什么？

他说，它就在你口中，在你心里。所以你的心是你相信的地方，你的口是你承认的地方，他在说什么？他说，这个与神的关系不是你成就的东西，而是你领受的东西。

它不是你证明你价值的东西，你只是得到它。因此他在说，他在说，这个与神的关系不是你上天去取的东西，你过海去取的东西，你不去进行某种探索，你不必是某个英雄战士，你通过恩典领受它。现在这是威胁性的，这是我们对它的第二个问题。

## 乃缦：当恩典感觉太容易 / Naaman: When Grace Feels Too Easy

If you want a perfect example of this, and it's a great example, is the biblical story of Naaman in 2 Kings chapter 5. In 2 Kings chapter 5 we're told about Naaman who was a Syrian general, and he was stricken with leprosy, and he knew he was going to die if he wasn't healed, and he heard about the God of Israel and his power. So he decided to go to Israel and find the prophet Elisha and seek his healing and salvation.

And the text tells us the way he's salad forth to do so, and what he brought with him showed that he understood himself being on a quest. He went with gold and treasure to buy whatever and purchase whatever he had to. He went with a sword, ready to do a great deed because he was a man of prowess and valor.

He went with letters of recommendation from his king, and so on, and he gets to the prophet's house, and Elisha doesn't even come out. Instead he's told by the valet of Elisha, go wash in the Jordan River. And a Naaman is furious, and he runs away in fury, and his servants go after them, and they say, master, master, if you were told by the prophet to do some great deed, wouldn't you have done it?

And that's the point. He's like all people, all ancient people, all modern people. If there's salvation, we're going to achieve it, we have to prove our worth, we have to leap from the lion's head, we have to bring out our sword, we have to do some great deed.

He was expecting Elisha to come out and say, bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west. And he would have been, he says, you see, here's what he's saying. He says, I'm a man of valor, I'm a man of wealth and means hard one.

And it wouldn't be insulting to say, go get the broomstick of the wicked witch of the west, get the golden fleece from the dragon, it wouldn't be wrong if you asked me to purchase with my great wealth, my healing and my salvation, or to win it by slaying a dragon. But any idiot can wash in the Jordan River, any child can wash in the Jordan River. That kind of God has a bar of salvation so low.

You know, Kathy and I remember, the one was the first person I ever shared the gospel faith with in our little town in Hope, Well, Virginia, where I first went as a 24-year-old pastor. And it was a young, really hurting young mother on welfare, single mother. And I shared the gospel and she said, it can't be that easy.

You know, same thing. That kind of God would have the bar of salvation so low. But the answer is, on the one hand, we have a God so incredibly inclusive that you've got grace, and that's a bar that anyone can step over, any murderer, any broken person, anyone can step over the bar because it's a bar of grace, but it's actually not low.

Demands and it requires that you lose your pride. Come on, Naaman, you say this is too low for me. No, you're not stepping over it, are you?

Why not? It's too high for you because there's two things that they offer a free grace, the graciousness of this offer. There's two things that it demands you to give up.

One is, you're right to look down on anybody else the rest of your life. You have to give up your pride. You have to give up forever.

You're right to look at anyone else and say, you don't understand, you rabble, you want clean, you fools. You're the reason that things are the way they are in this country. He takes away forever the idea, the pride because you have to say, I'm just a sinner, I need to be saved by grace.

The other thing you have to give up is control of your life because you see if you had salad forth, and if you had won your salvation with the kingdom or eternal life on a great quest, then God couldn't just ask anything of you, you have your rights. You've done what you should be doing. But if you out everything, everything, everything to His mercy, you owe Him everything.

You can't call the shots in your life anymore, don't you see? The incredible inclusiveness at the same time, the threatening costliness of the free grace of God, it is so simple, it is so easy that we can't take it, we're threatened by it. You see how this, see here's another aspect of this incredibly difficult simplicity.

This threatening graciousness, our pride, because of our pride, the absolute graciousness of the gospel throws us, don't let it throw you, but we're not done. First aspect of this difficult simplicity is the deceptive ordinariness. The second aspect is the threatening graciousness, but the third aspect is the unimaginable promise.

如果你想要一个完美的例子，它是一个很好的例子，就是《列王纪下》第5章中乃缦的圣经故事。在《列王纪下》第5章，我们被告知关于乃缦，他是一个叙利亚将军，他患了麻风病，他知道如果他不被医治，他会死，他听说了以色列的神和他的能力。所以他决定去以色列找先知以利沙，寻求他的医治和救恩。

经文告诉我们他如何出发去做这件事，他带了什么显示他理解自己在进行一次探索。他带着金银财宝去购买和买下他必须买的任何东西。他带着剑，准备做一件伟大的事，因为他是一个有能力和勇气的人。

他带着他国王的推荐信，等等，他到了先知的家，以利沙甚至都没有出来。相反，以利沙的仆人告诉他，去约旦河洗澡。乃缦大怒，愤怒地跑开了，他的仆人追上他们，他们说，主人，主人，如果先知告诉你做某件伟大的事，你不会做吗？

这就是要点。他像所有人一样，所有古人，所有现代人。如果有救恩，我们要成就它，我们必须证明我们的价值，我们必须从狮子头上跳跃，我们必须拿出我们的剑，我们必须做某件伟大的事。

他期待以利沙出来说，给我带来西方邪恶女巫的扫帚。他会说，他说，你看，他在说什么。他说，我是一个有勇气的人，我是一个辛苦赢得的财富和手段的人。

如果你要求我去取西方邪恶女巫的扫帚，从龙那里取金羊毛，这不会是侮辱性的，如果你要求我用我的巨大财富购买我的医治和救恩，或通过杀死一条龙来赢得它，这不会是错的。但任何白痴都可以在约旦河洗澡，任何孩子都可以在约旦河洗澡。那种神的救恩门槛如此之低。

你知道，凯茜和我记得，我在弗吉尼亚州霍普韦尔的小镇上第一次与人分享福音信仰的第一个人，我作为24岁的牧师首次去那里。那是一个年轻的、真正受伤的年轻母亲，靠福利生活的单身母亲。我分享了福音，她说，它不可能那么容易。

你知道，同样的事情。那种神会有如此之低的救恩门槛。但答案是，一方面，我们有一个如此难以置信地包容的神，你有恩典，那是一个任何人都可以跨过的门槛，任何杀人犯，任何破碎的人，任何人都可以跨过这个门槛，因为它是一个恩典的门槛，但它实际上并不低。

它要求并需要你失去你的骄傲。来吧，乃缦，你说这对我来说太低了。不，你没有跨过它，是吗？

为什么不呢？对你来说它太高了，因为这个白白恩典的提供有两件事，这个提供的恩慈。有两件事它要求你放弃。

一个是，你在余生中看不起任何其他人的权利。你必须放弃你的骄傲。你必须永远放弃。

你看着其他任何人说，你不明白，你这些暴民，你想要干净的，你们这些傻瓜。你们就是这个国家事情如此的原因。它永远拿走了这个想法，这个骄傲，因为你必须说，我只是一个罪人，我需要靠恩典得救。

你必须放弃的另一件事是对你生命的控制，因为你看，如果你已经出发了，如果你在一次伟大的探索中赢得了你的救恩，赢得了王国或永生，那么神就不能向你要求任何东西，你有你的权利。你已经做了你应该做的。但如果你所有的一切，一切，一切都归功于他的怜悯，你欠他一切。

你不能再在你的生命中发号施令了，你不明白吗？神白白恩典的难以置信的包容性，同时，威胁性的昂贵代价，它是如此简单，它是如此容易，以至于我们无法接受它，我们被它威胁到了。你看这如何，看这里是这个难以置信的困难简单性的另一个方面。

这个威胁性的恩慈，我们的骄傲，因为我们的骄傲，福音的绝对恩慈性让我们困惑，不要让它让你困惑，但我们还没有完成。这个困难简单性的第一个方面是欺骗性的平凡性。第二个方面是威胁性的恩慈，但第三个方面是不可想象的应许。

## 不可想象的应许：耶和华是你的生命 / The Unimaginable Promise: The Lord Is Your Life

What do I mean by that? You're smart people, this is New York, so if you're reading that passage, you realize that I've been concentrating on the first part of the passage, which seems to be all about grace. You don't have to go to heaven, you don't have to go over the sea, it's right there in your mouth in your heart, you have to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth, and it's there, it's right there, but then you get to the last part, and it seems like the second part totally contradicts what was just said, because it says, you see, if your heart turns away and you're not obedient, and if you're drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, I declare to you this day you will certainly be destroyed.

You will not live long in the land. This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses, choose life, or else all these curses will come upon you. And wait a minute, we say, wait a minute, that seems like we're back to the quest thing, we're back to going over the sea again.

Because we've been through this, all the book of Deuteronomy, we see what we're supposed to do, we see how we're supposed to live, we see how we're supposed to cheat God, we see how we're supposed to treat everyone else, and we'll never live up to that all the time. We'll never live up to that all the time. So it almost seems like the second part of this text poses a huge problem, it seems to contradict the first part, but it doesn't.

Because of the note, there is hope. You know what the hope is, it's in the very final verse, it's in the very, almost the final word of Moses, where he says, for the Lord is your life. Let me tell you what's going on there, let me tell you what an incredible promise that is, the first time in the Bible that that statement is made, and I think it's the last time in the whole Old Testament.

See up to now, life, and we're not talking about biological life, right? Choose life. It's not biological life, so what are they saying?

It's spiritual life, it's eternal life, it's the new heart and all that. Talked about that last week. So choose life.

Up until this point, life is connected with obedience, and death is connected with disobedience. If you obey, you'll get life, in other words, your obedience is your life. And if you disobey, you'll get death, in other words, your disobedience is your death.

So choose life, so obey. And all the way through the book up to now, that's what it's been telling you, your obedience is your life. Every time this word life, the spiritual life thing comes up, it says, if you obey, you'll get life, your obedience is your life, your obedience is your life.

But verse 20, suddenly, suddenly, Moses basically says here, your obedience would be your life, and it could be your life, but because it can't be your life, because you're not going to keep it up, the Lord will be your life. What does that mean? Not that the Lord will give you life if you obey.

That's not what it's saying. It says the Lord will be your life, the Lord himself will be your life. What does that mean?

我这是什么意思？你们是聪明人,这是纽约，所以如果你在读那段经文，你会意识到我一直专注于这段经文的前半部分，似乎全是关于恩典的。你不必上天，你不必过海，它就在那里，在你口中，在你心里，你必须在心里相信，用口承认，它就在那里，它就在那里，但然后你到了最后部分，似乎第二部分完全矛盾了刚才所说的，因为它说，你看，倘若你心里偏离，不肯听从，却被勾引去敬拜事奉别神，我今日明明告诉你们，你们必要灭亡。

你的日子必不长久。我今日呼天唤地向你作见证，我将生死祸福陈明在你面前，拣选生命，否则所有这些咒诅都会临到你。等等，我们说，等等，似乎我们又回到了探索的事情上，我们又回到了过海。

因为我们已经经历了这个，整本《申命记》，我们看到我们应该做什么，我们看到我们应该如何生活，我们看到我们应该如何欺骗神，我们看到我们应该如何对待其他所有人，我们永远不会一直做到那个。我们永远不会一直做到那个。所以似乎这段经文的第二部分提出了一个巨大的问题，它似乎矛盾了第一部分，但它没有。

因为有这个注释，有希望。你知道希望是什么吗，它在最后一节，它在摩西几乎最后的话中，他说，因为耶和华是你的生命。让我告诉你那里发生了什么，让我告诉你那是一个多么不可思议的应许，这是圣经中第一次做出那个陈述，我认为这是整个旧约中最后一次。

看到现在为止，生命，我们不是在谈论生物学生命，对吗？拣选生命。它不是生物学生命，那么他们在说什么？

它是属灵的生命，它是永恒的生命，它是新心等等。上周谈到了那个。所以拣选生命。

直到这一点，生命与顺服相连，死亡与悖逆相连。如果你顺服，你会得到生命，换句话说，你的顺服就是你的生命。如果你悖逆，你会得到死亡，换句话说，你的悖逆就是你的死亡。

所以拣选生命，所以顺服。一直到现在，整本书一直在告诉你这个，你的顺服就是你的生命。每次这个词生命，属灵生命的事出现，它说，如果你顺服，你会得到生命，你的顺服就是你的生命，你的顺服就是你的生命。

但第20节，突然，突然，摩西基本上在这里说，你的顺服本来会是你的生命，它可能是你的生命，但因为它不能是你的生命，因为你不会坚持下去，耶和华将是你的生命。那是什么意思？不是耶和华会在你顺服时给你生命。

那不是它在说的。它说耶和华本身将是你的生命，耶和华自己将是你的生命。那是什么意思？

## 基督的探索：通过失败得胜 / Christ's Quest: Triumph Through Losing

Paul explains it in Romans 10. In Romans chapter 10, Paul comes to this very passage when he's proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ to the readers of the book of Romans, to the Romans. He goes to this very passage and he interprets the passage in the most unbelievable way.

Here's what he says. This is Romans 10. Christ is the end of the law, says Paul, as a means of righteousness for everyone who believes.

Now about this righteousness that comes through faith, Moses has said, quote, do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven, for that would bring Christ down. And he says, do not say who will descend into the deep, for that would bring Christ, that would be to bring Christ up from the abyss, but what does it say? What does Moses say?

He says, the word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word of faith we are proclaiming, that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Did you hear that? Look, first of all, he says, Christ is the end of the law, not period.

He says, Christ is the end of the law for righteousness. It's still there to please God, to change your life, but it's no longer a means to stand before God, righteousness and accept it, don't I know? Why not?

Jesus went into the abyss. Jesus went on the quest for eternal life. Moses says, Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go to heaven, no because Jesus has come down from heaven.

Paul says, Moses says you don't have to go over to see because Jesus went into the depths of the sea and he took the destructive forces and he received a destruction that we deserve. He took the curses in himself, he was destroyed. He went on a great quest, he went on the quest.

He won eternal life and now he gives it to us as a gift, but I want you to know one thing. The quest of Jesus Christ was different than any other quest that's ever happened. I read a scholarly article some years ago that really blew my socks off.

It was amazing. First of all, it was a scholarly article. It was by a scholar who was actually trying to look and speak broadly about almost all the ancient mythic prehistories of all the different cultures, whether Northern European or Mediterranean, Greek and Roman or Asian, and they were looking at all these stories and all these legends and they all had, there was a certain pattern to all of them.

That was, you had these strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something. They were all about that. All the legends were like that.

Strong heroic figures who went on quests to win something and then the article amazingly said this, the scholar of the last generation who knew the most in the entire world about these ancient myths and legends, knew them in the originals and all that. The scholar of the last generation who knew most more about them than anybody else alive was J. R.

R. Tolkien, who was an Oxford professor. This article said, secondly, he loved them so much that he wanted to write his own.

He wanted to write his own mythic story about a quest and he did, but 0.3, he was so saturated with Christianity and so saturated with the Christian gospel that his story is almost the antithesis of every other mythic prehistory that ever happened. Because every single other ancient legend has a strong figure going off to save the world by winning something. But in Tolkien and in the gospel, the world is saved by a weak figure who triumphs through losing and goes off quest not to gain something but to lose something.

You see at the heart of history and at the heart of ours is a suffering servant who triumphed through losing, who fell into the dark so we could live in the light. And that's the reason why Jesus quest is different than all these other self-saving, self-justifying quests in all the other cultures. And that's the reason why there's one Christian poet Edward Chilato who addressing Jesus spoke to him this way.

The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but thou just stumbled to your throne. But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak and not a God has wounds but thou alone.

The other gods were strong but thou was weak. They rode but you did stumble to your throne. You are wounds only God's wounds can speak and there's no God in any of the religion that has wounds but thou alone.

The simplicity is the difficulties, let me close like this. If you are exploring Christianity or if you have maybe come to, you know, you may be erased in a church and now you're trying to think, well, what's my relationship to Christianity? Tell my word, please realize that in some ways understand the difficulty of the simplicity and grasping the simplicity in all of its difficulty is how you become a Christian.

You want to know how to become a Christian? You want to know how to get a covenant relationship with God? That's it.

You say, well, that's paradoxical. What do you mean? Give me a perfect case study.

In 1740s, there were a group of young men who were actually all part of the church. In fact, I think some of them were ordained ministers. They were in the Church of England and they were in London but they knew there was something missing.

They knew they didn't have a personal relationship with God. They didn't have a covenant relationship with God. They didn't have a new heart.

They began a set of evening meetings in which they read to each other Luther's preface to the Galatians, Martin Luther's preface to the book of the Galatians. On successive nights over a period of a week or so, John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, Charles Wesley, great hymn writer and his brother and a whole lot of their friends got converted. When the penny dropped of the simplicity of the grace of God, here's one of the men named William Holland that you wouldn't have heard of, but it's a perfect example of what happened.

This is his diary. Mr. Charles Wesley read aloud and at the place where Luther said, what have we then nothing to do?

No, nothing. But only to accept him who of God is made unto us who becomes for us, our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption. And adhering those words, there came such a power over me as I cannot well imagine my end described.

My heart was so filled with peace and love that I burst into tears and went afterwards I went into the street. I could scarcely feel the ground I trot upon. Now what happened was the simplicity of grace hit him.

And the moment that happened, and the moment he was willing to pay those to cost, to get rid of your pride, to say from now on, I'll never be able to look down at anybody, and to get rid of any control of your life, because now you know you owe him everything, everything to his mercy. If you're willing to pay those prices and the simplicity of grace happens at that moment you are becoming a Christian, at that moment you are entering into that personal relationship with God. And you say, well, if, what if I already believe?

You have a final word for me, sure. The life, the life that's in you. God is your life.

Because of Jesus, he's your life now. It's guaranteed. It's in you.

That's why Colossians 3, Paul says, and 1 John 3, they talks about our life is hid with God. Our life is in God. And we really don't even know what we're going to be.

And when Jesus Christ is revealed on the last day, we know we'll be like Him. I mean, it's over the top. The life that started in you is just a sea.

You're just a shadow of what you're going to be. See us Lewis describes though what you are going to be. Live in hope of this.

He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into dazzling radiant immortal creatures, pulsating through with an energy, joy, wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine. He can make us all bright, stainless mirrors which reflect back to God perfectly though on a smaller scale, his own boundless power, delight and goodness. That is what we are in for.

Nothing less. Let's pray. Thank you, Father.

Thank you, Father. That through Jesus Christ, you can be our life. We thank you for the life that you've planted in so many of us.

We thank you for the hope that that gives us as we think about our future. And we thank you for the difficult simplicity of the gospel. And we pray that you would keep us from letting our pride throw us, letting our snobbishness overlook it, letting our self-satisfaction keep us from working out the radical implications of the gospel for every area of our life.

So we ask that you would help us now to really receive your life through Jesus Christ. We choose it. We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

保罗在《罗马书》第10章解释了它。在《罗马书》第10章，保罗来到这段经文，当他向《罗马书》的读者，向罗马人宣告耶稣基督的福音时。他来到这段经文，他以最难以置信的方式解释这段经文。

他是这样说的。这是《罗马书》第10章。保罗说，基督是律法的总结，作为每个相信的人的义的手段。

现在关于这个通过信而来的义，摩西说过，引用，不要心里说谁要升到天上，因为那会把基督带下来。他说，不要说谁要降到深渊，因为那会把基督，那会是把基督从深渊带上来，但它说什么？摩西说什么？

他说，这话离你甚近，就在你口中，在你心里，这就是我们所宣扬的信的道，就是你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救。你听到了吗？看，首先，他说，基督是律法的总结，不是句号。

他说，基督是律法作为义的总结。它仍然在那里讨神喜悦，改变你的生命，但它不再是一个站在神面前的手段，义和接受，我不知道吗？为什么不呢？

耶稣进入了深渊。耶稣进行了寻求永生的探索。摩西说，保罗说，摩西说你不必上天，不，因为耶稣已经从天上降下来。

保罗说，摩西说你不必过海，因为耶稣进入了海的深处，他承受了我们应得的毁灭性力量。他自己承受了咒诅，他被毁灭了。他进行了一次伟大的探索，他进行了探索。

他赢得了永生，现在他把它作为礼物给我们，但我想让你知道一件事。耶稣基督的探索与曾经发生过的任何其他探索都不同。几年前我读了一篇学术文章，真的让我大吃一惊。

它太神奇了。首先，这是一篇学术文章。它是由一位学者写的，他实际上试图广泛地看待和谈论几乎所有不同文化的所有古代神话史前史，无论是北欧还是地中海、希腊罗马还是亚洲，他们在看所有这些故事和所有这些传说，它们都有，所有这些都有某种模式。

那就是，你有这些强大的英雄人物进行探索去赢得某样东西。所有的传说都是关于那个的。所有的传说都是那样的。

强大的英雄人物进行探索去赢得某样东西，然后这篇文章令人惊讶地说了这个，上一代对这些古代神话和传说了解最多的学者，在原文中了解它们等等。上一代比任何其他活着的人都更了解它们的学者是J.R.R.托尔金，他是牛津大学的教授。这篇文章说，其次，他如此热爱它们，以至于他想写自己的。

他想写自己的关于探索的神话故事，他做到了，但第三点，他如此浸淫于基督教，如此浸淫于基督教福音，以至于他的故事几乎是曾经发生过的每一个其他神话史前史的对立面。因为每一个其他古代传说都有一个强大的人物出去通过赢得某样东西来拯救世界。但在托尔金和福音中，世界是由一个软弱的人物通过失败而得胜并出去探索不是去获得某样东西而是去失去某样东西而得救的。

你看在历史的核心和我们的核心是一个受苦的仆人，他通过失败而得胜，他坠入黑暗中，这样我们就可以活在光明中。这就是为什么耶稣的探索与所有其他文化中所有那些自我拯救、自我称义的探索不同。这就是为什么有一位基督教诗人爱德华·希拉托向耶稣说话，这样对他说。

其他的神都是强壮的，但你是软弱的。他们骑马，但你只是跌跌撞撞地走向你的宝座。但对我们的伤口，只有神的伤口能说话，没有一个神有伤口，只有你独自有。

其他的神都是强壮的，但你是软弱的。他们骑马，但你确实跌跌撞撞地走向你的宝座。你的伤口，只有神的伤口能说话，在任何宗教中没有神有伤口，只有你独自有。

简单性就是困难，让我这样结束。如果你在探索基督教，或者如果你已经到了，你知道，你可能在教会中长大，现在你在试图思考，嗯，我与基督教的关系是什么？相信我的话，请意识到在某种程度上理解简单性的困难并在其所有困难中抓住简单性就是你如何成为一个基督徒。

你想知道如何成为一个基督徒吗？你想知道如何获得与神的立约关系吗？就是这个。

你说，嗯，那是矛盾的。你是什么意思？给我一个完美的案例研究。

在1740年代，有一群年轻人，他们实际上都是教会的一部分。事实上，我认为他们中的一些人是被按立的牧师。他们在英国圣公会，他们在伦敦，但他们知道有些东西缺失了。

他们知道他们没有与神的个人关系。他们没有与神的立约关系。他们没有新心。

他们开始了一系列晚间聚会，在其中他们互相阅读路德的《加拉太书》序言，马丁·路德的《加拉太书》序言。在一周左右的连续晚上，约翰·卫斯理，卫理公会的创始人，查尔斯·卫斯理，伟大的赞美诗作者和他的兄弟，以及他们的很多朋友都归信了。当神恩典的简单性的硬币落下时，这里有一个叫威廉·霍兰德的人，你不会听说过他，但这是发生了什么的一个完美例子。

这是他的日记。查尔斯·卫斯理先生大声朗读，在路德说的地方，我们还有什么要做的吗？

不，什么都没有。只是接受他，他由神成为我们的，成为我们的智慧、我们的公义、我们的成圣、我们的救赎。在坚持这些话时，有一种力量临到我身上，我无法很好地想象我的结局描述。

我的心充满了和平和爱，以至于我泪流满面，之后我走到街上。我几乎感觉不到我脚下的地面。现在发生的是恩典的简单性击中了他。

当那发生的那一刻，当他愿意付出那些代价，摆脱你的骄傲，从现在开始说，我永远不能看不起任何人，并摆脱对你生命的任何控制，因为现在你知道你欠他一切，所有的一切都归功于他的怜悯。如果你愿意付出这些代价，恩典的简单性发生了，在那一刻你正在成为一个基督徒，在那一刻你正在进入那与神的个人关系。你说，嗯，如果，如果我已经相信了呢？

你有最后一句话给我吗，当然。生命，在你里面的生命。神是你的生命。

因为耶稣，他现在是你的生命。它是有保证的。它在你里面。

这就是为什么《歌罗西书》第3章，保罗说，和《约翰一书》第3章，他们谈到我们的生命与神一同藏在神里面。我们的生命在神里面。我们真的甚至不知道我们将会是什么。

当耶稣基督在末日被启示时，我们知道我们会像他一样。我的意思是，它太过分了。在你里面开始的生命只是一粒种子。

你只是你将要成为的样子的一个影子。看C.S.路易斯描述你将要成为什么。活在这个希望中。

他将使我们这些最软弱和最污秽的人成为眩目的、光辉的、不朽的生物，脉动着我们现在无法想象的能量、喜乐、智慧和爱。他可以使我们所有人成为明亮的、无瑕的镜子，完美地反射回神，虽然在更小的规模上，他自己无限的能力、喜悦和良善。这就是我们要得到的。

不会少。让我们祷告。谢谢你，父神。

谢谢你，父神。通过耶稣基督，你可以成为我们的生命。我们感谢你在我们许多人里面种下的生命。

我们感谢你当我们思想我们的未来时它给我们的希望。我们感谢你福音的困难简单性。我们祈求你会保守我们不让我们的骄傲让我们困惑，让我们的势利让我们忽视它，让我们的自我满足阻止我们为我们生活的每个领域推算出福音的激进含义。

所以我们请求你会帮助我们现在真正通过耶稣基督领受你的生命。我们拣选它。我们奉耶稣的名求，阿们。
