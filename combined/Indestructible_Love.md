# Indestructible Love / Indestructible Love

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. You don't have to look far to see that something's deeply wrong with our world and with us. But is there an answer that gets to the root of why?

In today's message, Tim Keller explores the human condition through stories in the Bible, uncovering what Scripture says about sin and why it's the only explanation deep enough to face the truth about ourselves. I'm going to read you from Isaiah chapter 49. I'm going to read verses 8 down to 16.

It's in your bulletin. I'm going to read to verse 16. This is what the Lord says.

In the time of my favor, I will answer you and in the time of day of salvation, I will help you. I will keep you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people to restore the land and to re assign its desolate inheritances to say to the captives, come out and to those in darkness be free. They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.

They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water. I will turn all my mountains into roads and my highways will be raised up.

See, they will come from afar, some from the north from this west, some from the region of Aswan. Shout for joy, oh heavens, rejoice so earth, burst into song, oh mountains, for the Lord comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. But Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.

Can a mother forget the baby at her breast had had no compassion on the child she has born? Though she may forget, I will not forget you. See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.

Your walls are ever before me. Let's end there. This is God's Word.

Now, if you've been coming over the weeks, you know, this is the actually end of a series on what the Bible has to say about what's wrong with the human heart, what's wrong with the human race, what the Bible calls sin. And if you're part of this series, you need to know that if you've been following this series, this is the ultimate cure. Well, we actually have here, let me remind you this when we've been in Isaiah for a while, what we have here is something written to people who are going to face our facing exile.

The Jews had Jerusalem destroyed. That's the reason why there's discussion about Zion's wall. Zion was the hill on which the temple was built.

And therefore, the word Zion can mean the city of Jerusalem. It sometimes can mean the temple, but the point is that when the Babylonian Empire came and besieged Jerusalem and destroyed it, everything was torn down. The walls of Jerusalem were torn down.

The temple was torn down. The people were sent into captivity. And what Isaiah is giving us is a prophecy from the Lord to the people.

And here he's asking, here he's answering the question. And the question is going to be, how can we face this? What are you going to do about this?

Now, up to verse 13 and we didn't print all of it in this chapter, we have a typical theological discourse. Isaiah, through Isaiah, God is saying what he's going to do about it. And verses 1 to 8, we start with verse 8, but verses 1 to 8 of chapter 49 talks about the servant, this mysterious figure who's going to come, the servant of the Lord.

And what he's going to do is he's going to suffer. And as a result of the suffering, we say in verses 9 to 12, he's going to gather a new people. He's going to create a new community of people from the east and the west, pardon not from the east actually, from the desert over there, but from the north and the west and the south.

And there are going to be people who have been brought out of darkness, people who have been set free. And so because of his suffering, he's going to create a new community. And then lastly, when you get to verse 13, which is the climax, this enormous theological discourse, we're told here that what God is going to do through the servant and in this group of people, is going to be a such power that is going to actually redeem all of the world.

Because when you see here, we see shop for joy or heavens, or earth person to song or mountains, God is actually going to renew all of creation. Whatever God does is going to be so powerful that all of creation, the heavens and the earth is everything's going to be renewed. Everything's going to be brought into some kind of blossom.

And that's what God is saying. He's going to do. It's sweeping.

It's huge. It's immense. And it's too sweeping and it's too huge and it's too immense.

Because verse 14 just hits you between the eyes. If you're reading along, if you're reading through the chapter, in a way, I can see this in a way that you can't because I didn't print you the whole chapter here. But if you move on through the chapter, here's God talking about, I'm going to do this.

And I'm going to do that. And this is, of course, at least the Stoxology where he's calling nature to blossom into praise God. And suddenly verse 14 comes along.

And what is verse 14? What is it? The people listening to God respond.

And what do they say? Wow, no, what do they say? Look, I'm still depressed.

Here's God saying, oh, look at all the things I'm going to do. And what it says, but Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me. The Lord has forgotten me.

Now what you have here is God giving this theological discourse to the people. And the people responding by saying that, say, saying this, the realities of my present life are overwhelming such remote, abstract, distant, lofty promises and claims. All your theology.

All I know is Zion's broken down. My life is broken down. How could you let this happen to me?

In other words, here's God giving this great theological discourse. And the people say, I'm still depressed. You forsaken me.

You forgot me. I don't even know what you're talking about all this heavens and earth. I don't know who this servant is.

I don't know what's going on here. And therefore what we have is industrial strength despondency, the human heart. It's very hard to make the human heart feel happy and loved.

I mean, some of us are worse than others. Let's face it. But basically here, listen, you tell a human heart.

You're a disgrace. You're trash. You're despicable.

And you never forget those. You never forget statements like that. Never in your whole life.

But you tell a human heart, you're wonderful, you're great. I like you. And you need that.

It fades so fast. Five minutes later, you need to hear it again. Or you forget it.

The human heart falls into respondents in spite of claims of love. And what does God do? We have here.

It's very interesting. In verse 14, we see someone saying in spite of all these great claims, I'm still depressed. You don't love me.

I don't feel left by you. I don't feel that you're committed to me. And we see how God deals with a despondent heart.

And that's pretty instructive. How does God deal with it? How does God deal with a person who's despondent in despair?

First of all, let me show you two general principles and then three specific principles, two general ways in which God works with a despondent depressed person. And then three very specific things that he joins us to do. First, there's two real general principles and they go like this.

First of all, God stops. That may not be as easy for you to see unless you read in the whole chapter, but God sees on his way. He's talking about things.

And he's actually got, he's, verses 1 to 13 is really a wonderful, a wonderful, there's the structure of this discourse is wonderful. And I'm not even going to talk about it here tonight, because I don't think that's what we're going to, we're not going to dwell on that. But he actually talks about three great stages in history of salvation.

He's moving from the cross to a new community to a new creation, from cross to community to new creation. It's really wonderful. And then suddenly he looks down and he says, any questions, I mean, this is like it like sure.

He's I'm going on to say any questions. And somebody puts up their hand and say, I'm depressed. I'm despondent.

I don't understand what you're talking about. I feel cast out. I feel like it's all over.

God stops. Because verse 15, verse 16, in fact, all the rest of the chapter. God stops what he's saying.

He changed the subject because they say, you've forgotten me and everything about the rest of the chapter is about that idea. In other words, God, God lets himself be interrupted. He stops.

And that's very important. Recently I have a, when I think about my own pastoral career, I realize that no matter what gender you are, no matter what race you are, no matter what age you are, we're all stupid in our own, special way. And when I was a young pastor, I had a tendency not to stop.

When someone spoke despondently, there's a tendency to just pour on the theology. So, well, let me finish my lecture. Let me, you know, don't you know, you're just a fight by faith.

You're adopted into the family. You're going to rule and reign. Don't you know, you're theology.

It's when you're younger, when you're a younger band, when a younger pastor, there's a tendency to just say, well, I can fix this. Let me keep on going with my, my thing. You know, let me just pour the theology on.

But God stops. Now, on the other hand, as I'm becoming an older minister, as it's obvious, I realize I still don't want to stop, but for different reasons. Well, you know, now when you see somebody despondent, in spite of all these great claims, now when you see someone say, I know what Christianity teaches, and I know what the Bible says, and I know all that, I'm still depressed.

There's a tendency to look down and say, well, get over it. But you know, when you get older, you've seen people get through things and you say, come on, you'll survive. This will be all right.

You know, what are you wallowing for? People have had much worse problems than you have, and you get through it, and I've been through. So when you're younger, it's a tendency not to stop and really listen, and when you get older, it's a tendency not to stop and really listen.

I don't know when I'll be a good pastor. I do know this. God is interrupted.

He stops. But the other general principle, he stops, but he argues, because verse 15 and 16 is an argument. Verse 15 and 16 is pugnacious.

Verse 15 and 16 is contradicting what the despondent heart says, and this is a perfect balance, because on the other hand, he's got the compassion to stop, but he argues. Now, if you want a perfect example of this principle, this balance that you've got to have, if you're dealing with your own despondency, or somebody else's, the principle is best embodied in Psalm 42, where you have a Psalmist who's discouraged, and the Psalmist says to himself, he says, why art thou cast down on my soul? Why art thou cast down on my soul?

And why art thou is quite with him? Now, if you look here, that's the perfect balance, because on the one hand, he's listening to a soul. He's listening to his heart.

He's saying, what's the source of your disquiet? What's the source of your casting down? He's listening to his heart.

But on the other hand, he's arguing with his heart. Why are you cast down on my soul? What are you doing down there?

Now, here's the principle I mean. Before we move on to specifics, it's the general principle. If you don't listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble.

But if you only listen to your heart, you'll be in psychological rubble. If you don't listen to your heart, by the way, almost all of us fall into one of these or the other. One of these mistakes.

Some of us just don't listen. We say, oh, well, you know, you, you, you deny it. You don't, you know, all that upset.

I'm not angry. I'm not, I'm all right. I'm fine.

And you just stay busy. And you don't sit down and listen to your heart. You don't listen to find out just how bad is it?

And what's the cause of it? So a lot of us just, well, you know, we're kind of extroverts, you know, so let's get out and do things. You know, that'll, I'll just be fine.

We don't listen to our heart. On the other hand, some of us do nothing but listen to our heart. We just let our heart forsaken, forgotten, forsaken, forgotten.

You want chemistry? I'm forsaken. I'm forgot.

Now listen, if you only listen to your heart and you never talk to it and you never grab hold of it and you say just the truth, you're out of touch with reality, buddy. I mean, you have to do that. If you don't, if you never listen to your heart and if you only listen to your heart, but see what God does is he stops to listen.

He takes it very seriously, but he argues. And that's the general principles. However, what's the specific things he does with a despondent heart?

And there's three things. And you know what? As I hinted at the beginning, these three things do not just cure a despondent heart, and this is the cure for a sinful heart.

You know, the word forgotten for forsaken, the word for forsaken is kind of an external word. It has more to do with you haven't come through for me, but the word forgotten is more of an internal word, which is you've rejected me. For forsaken has more to do without a sight and forgotten, more out of mind.

For forsaken, more is how can you have let these things happen to me? Forgotten is more like you've rejected me because there's something wrong, isn't there? I'm no good.

And you know, sometimes despondency is made up more of anger than shame and sometimes it's made up more of shame than anger, but they're kissing cousins. They're very, very close. It's very hard to know, which is which sometimes.

And so when God comes to the despondent sinful sick heart, he enjoins three things. He calls us to three things. And they're all here in verse 15 and 16, verse 15, 16 A and 16 B.

Look, well, I'll just say what the three things are. He says, think of who you. Think of who I am.

Look at what I have done. And practice who you are, okay? Think of who I am.

Look at what I've done and practice who you are. Now, here's the three. First of all, think of who I am.

Who is he? Now, we have here a metaphor that God deliberately chooses to tell us something about who he is. Verse 15, can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child?

She is born. Yay, she may forget, but I will not forget you. Now, why does God pick a nursing mother to tell us something about himself?

This is not sentimental. As a matter of fact, it's not sentimental at all. If you think about it, because he's really talking about mothers who sometimes forget.

I mean, this isn't sentimentalizing. This is not a way of saying, oh, there's nothing like a mother's love. This is not what's going on here because there are things like a mother's love.

A love between husband and wife is certainly as deep, really richer and certainly more satisfying, I think. But God has chosen this particular kind of human connection to tell us something about himself that's incredible. I mean, well, here's what it is.

What is a nursing mother like or in relationship to what is this? Okay. This is the point.

A nursing mother's relationship of love to her child is not that volitional. It's not that it's not conditional. It's not volitional and conditional.

You fall in love with somebody. You choose that person. They choose you.

You know, you do something. They do something. If they don't reciprocate, you can't go on.

Okay. There's conditions. There's volition.

There's choices, but there's something incredibly powerful and virtually automatic. A mother's love for her child is driven by her very nature. It's driven by her biology.

It's hardwired. Let me give you three examples of this. A nursing mother, first of all, a nursing mother's relationship to her child is rigidly regular.

I had a laugh, by the way. Matthew Henry is a Puritan who wrote a commentary at the end of the 1600, 1690s. Puritans, they're a little straight-laced.

Why would a man know this except that I understand his wife had 11 children? Therefore, this is what he says in his commentary. A nursing mother, most of all, cannot but be tender of her sucking child for her own breast will soon put her in mind of it if she should forget it.

Here's something. By the way, for some of you guys, this might come as news for you. Unless a nursing mother regularly nurses her child, unless she releases the milk, unless she is meeting the needs of her child, she's in pain.

Your breasts hurt. Yes, love between a man and a woman. That might be people say, well, that's hormones, but boy, this is hormones.

You say, well, your hormones are driving, but not like this. Every so many hours you're in pain if you don't meet the needs of this loved one is unbelievably regular, and then secondly, it's incredibly tender and emotional. There's another thing that Matthew Henry and I have learned from talking to nursing mothers is that along with the milk comes tremendous feelings of nurture and emotion.

Sometimes the milk brings the feeling, sometimes the feelings and the thoughts bring the milk. This is a part of the biology, it's part of the hormone. It's part of who she is that as she thinks loving thoughts, the milk comes and it's a tremendous tenderness.

She takes that baby and she looks at every single thing about it. She looks at every hair. She looks at every eyelash.

She's moved by who she is to this enormously detailed and tender care. And then thirdly, it's not only rigidly regular. It's not unbelievably emotionally tender, but it is utterly unconditional.

When you enter into a relationship with a husband or wife or you get romantically involved with somebody, there's got to be some reciprocity. Then the person's got to do something back. I'm sorry.

The person never even speaks on your first date. You know, you've had a bad date. But here's a woman that finds herself driven by her very being to lovingly, suddenly new mothers, this happens.

Your life stops. Everything in your life stops and it's completely revolving around this little thing. Seven days a week, 25 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

And the kid doesn't even burp. Thank you. Those burps are not thank you.

So you can, you want to imagine it fine, but it's just not the case. The child does nothing. The child, there's no conditions.

Doesn't matter what the child does, what child looks like the child doesn't merit it. It is utterly, utterly regular. It is utterly tender and it is completely unconditional.

Imagine God to choose this to talk about how He relates to us. It's not the only image, friends. This is not the only image.

Of course, we know there's others to get across the idea. But do you see the power of this thing? He says that's how I relate to you.

That is one image that I can give you to give you some idea about how strongly, how powerfully, how detailed and how unconditionally I love you. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time and study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Because you see when he says, yes, she may forget.

What does she see? He's saying, what he's saying is, yeah, mothers don't forget. I mean, nature only goes so far.

There are women who buck nature. There are women who don't do it. But what he's trying to say is simply this.

He says, my love for you is not only exactly like a mother's natural love, but it's infinitely greater. But don't you see the real point? He's not just saying, you see a mother's love?

Mine's more powerful. You see a mother's love? Mine's more free and unconditional.

You see a mother's love? My love is more detailed. Don't I say in Psalm 56?

I know how many tears are going down your cheek even a mother doesn't know that. But he's going beyond that. And he's trying to say, I am misdriven by my nature to love you as a mother is to love her child.

It is utterly natural. And when he says that, now there's a number of commentators that have helped me on this and have said, this is astounding because if you think about it, especially since, and this is one of the reasons why this sermon came after last week's sermon, last week's sermon tells us something about the nature of God. He is holy.

He's a judge. He is a, what, we talked about this lot. He's an angry God.

He's angry about evil. He's a God of tremendous justice. And in light of that, what would you say?

If God loves us, surely he's bucking his nature. If God loves us, surely it's wonderful, but surely he's bucking it. And God says, no.

If I would cease to love you, I'd cease to be me. Everything about me, everything about my nature leads me to be absolutely, powerfully, unconditionally, tenderly, emotionally, regularly. I hurt.

It's hard to believe that he would say, I hurt if I don't make your needs. How could that be? Well, it's the second.

The first thing he says, this is who I am, but you don't understand how that could be unless he's looked secondly at, look what I've done. And what has he done? Verse 16, the first, for first clause is what he's saying.

See? I have engraved you on the palms of my hand. Now this is the answer to what we just asked.

How could, how, I know, some of you are going to the bends. I mean, last week, the whole point was, this is an angry God. And God says he's an angry God.

He says, I am a pure eyes that can be hold iniquity. And here he says, my very purity, my very, my very nature has turned me into someone far more powerfully, far more driven to love you than a mother for an infant. How could that be?

Here's the answer. Look what he's done. I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.

Now what in the world is that mean? Let's let's break it into two pieces, engraved palm of the hands. What is this image getting across?

Everything. First of all, engraved. Listen, there are some perfectly decent words they could have used.

Or Isaiah could have used or God could have used, however they worked this out, which I don't completely understand. But perfectly good words for, for, for tattoo, they didn't use them. This isn't, it's not what it's saying.

Nothing tattooed. It's not saying written engraved. And the word engraved, you say, what does the word, what it means exactly what it means in English?

It means to get out a hammer and get out a chisel and to actually cut into stump something hard. That's weird. Why?

Well, first of all, engraved means two things. First of all, it means permanent. He's put his name, our names on his hands permanently.

They'll never wash off, they'll never wear off. There's two ways, you know, you put something on your hands. Sometimes it washes off.

Sometimes it just wears off with a lot of heavy use. Nothing. We'll take our name off his hands.

But it's not just permanent. The word engraved also means artistry. He doesn't say he chipped it.

Ingraved is a work of art. And it gets at this. What it's getting at is the other place in the Bible that talks about our names being engraved is back in Exodus 28.

In Exodus 28, we're told the high priest when he goes before God into the tabernacle is wearing an effort, which is a breastplate. And on the breastplate, there are two precious stones. They're in a gold.

They're encased in gold. So they're absolutely gorgeous. And on those stones is engraved the names of the children of Israel.

And why? Well, see, this is the connection between the two. In verse in chapter 28, it says, why is the high priest doing that?

It's very simple. It says in order to be a perpetual memorial before the Lord. Memorial.

In other words, whenever God minds us, this is what Exodus 28 say. Whenever God remembers us, whenever God thinks of us, he looks at our names and he sees a beauty. He says an unbelievable beauty.

Now listen, just for a second, this is something that no other religion, not only no other religion gives you, this is even something that most of us who erased in Christian churches have never really come to grips with. This is an astonishing statement. And grave means the work of art.

And this is what God is saying. It is possible to be in a relationship with me. So you are not just tolerated by me.

So you don't just have access to me. So that you don't just every so often you're able to come and get things from me. You don't have just a relationship in which when you die, you'll be able to have blessings and paradise.

He is saying, it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that you know that when I look at you, I'm having an aesthetic experience. And you see the link when a mother looks at a child because of her very nature, she just drools over the child. Literally.

And God says it's possible to be in a relationship with me so that when I see you, I'm ravished with your beauty, I can't get over you. I can hardly express the delight, I can hardly understand. I can't hardly believe I'm just drawn to you.

That's the link. We're engraved. It means we are an aesthetic experience.

Here's another way to put it. When God, what do you look like? Who are you?

When it's possible to be in a relationship with God so that you know this, that when God looks at you, he sees an absolute beauty. And of course, if God sees you that way, then that's the definitive view. It doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what your friends say, it doesn't matter what your parents say, it doesn't matter what the mirror says.

It doesn't matter if you put on five pounds, it doesn't matter. None of those things could pop. This is the ultimate mind.

This is the ultimate view. This is the ultimate you. And God says, yes, it's possible to be in a relationship to me so that you're a work of art.

When you say, how could that be? And here's the answer. It's not, you see, if you go back to Exodus 28, it's almost completely inexplicable.

How in the world could we possibly be something that beautiful? Well, yeah, I see, we're engraved on these beautiful stones on a high precephal. That's beautiful.

It's wonderful. How, how could that possibly be? This is ridiculous, maybe you'd say.

But here we see something else. Here we see our names are engraved on his hands. On the palms.

Now, first of all, the palms of the hands means this is the most visible place. If I, if I would engrave something anywhere else in my body, I might not see it. But my palms, my hands, I can't help but see it.

Secondly, what this means is it means that absolutely everything he does, the palm is the way you do everything. This is how I move my mic. Here's how I look at my watch.

Here's how I turn off the light. I have to use my palms. And when God says, I put your, your name on the palms of my hand, what he's saying is everything I do.

I'm doing for you. It's like a mother. Everything I do, I'm doing for you.

No matter what happens, I'm doing for you. You know, so here's Joseph and his brothers grab him and throw him into a pit. Remember?

And they sell him into slavery to Egypt. And he's down the pit. We're told back in the passage in Genesis and he's crying out to them.

And he's crying out to God. And God seems like he doesn't remember him, doesn't hear him. But you see later on, Joseph was able to realize if God had actually answered my prayer as I made it, I'd be dead now.

I never would have become Prime Minister of Egypt. I never would have run the family relief program. I never would have saved all those thousands of people.

I wouldn't even have saved my own family's physical life. And I never would have led my own brothers to repentance. And therefore, they would have been spiritually dead, they would have been physically dead.

In other words, God, when he seemed to not answer my prayer, was remembering me, everything that happens, everything he does is being done for me. It's amazing. You say, well, but that's not all.

It's not just that it's on the palm of the hands of the most visible place, not palms of the hands of the most active place, but it's the most vulnerable place. You see, when somebody says, listen, see, my outstretched palms, this is the trans cultural sign of vulnerability. If someone says, hands up, come out with your hands up, you don't come out like this.

They'll shoot you. I mean, hands palms means I have no weapon. A palm means I have to open my palm to shake, to shake your hand.

A palm means appeal, a palm means welcome, a palm means receive. When my palms are open, I am vulnerable. Now, here's the question, how in the world, why in the world would someone engrave the palm?

That would be, if you're going to put a chisel, that's just terrible. That must have hurt terribly. It did.

Many centuries later, somebody came to another doubter, another despondent person, his name was Thomas. And he said to Thomas, look at the palms of my hands. And when you look at Jesus Christ, look at the palms of his hands to see where your name is, and you will see nail prints.

Why? This is the reason why we're a beauty to him. The reason we're such a beauty to God is because our names have been engraved in something more precious than stones, more precious than diamonds.

The sufferings of Jesus, the nails of Jesus, are the tools with which our names are engraved on the palms of the hands. And what that means, finally we have an answer to how 15 can be true. 16,000 is how 15 can be true.

If Jesus Christ has, is our high priest, if he stands before the Father's throne, and he says, look at what I have done. Look at my suffering. Look at how I've paid for everything.

Look at how I've made a sacrifice. Do you know what that means? Over the years, when I first heard that Jesus Christ was our high priest, and this is in Hebrews chapter 7, I'll affect the whole book of Hebrews, and it's in verse 1, chapter 2, where it says that Jesus Christ, it's just an image, but it's getting a point across.

Jesus Christ stands before the throne of God. And he shows the wounds. And he pleads for us.

When I first heard about that, I said, well, that's good, but it's not completely comforting, because how many times will God finally listen to Jesus about me? I mean, I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I keep failing, and I guess every day, Monday morning Jesus will come on up there and say, look, Tim did it again. But for my sake, would you please continue to love him?

I see God up there on the throne saying, well, all right. But that's to miss the whole thrust of everything this whole passage is about. When Jesus Christ stands before the father's throne now, we know this.

He is not, when he says, love my brothers and sisters. When he pleads for us, he's not demanding, he's not asking for mercy. You know that?

He's not asking for mercy. He's demanding justice. Okay, give me 60 seconds, will you?

Jesus Christ is saying this, thy law, O God, the man's death. For sin, I have paid all their debts. They trusted me, their debts are paid, and therefore for you to get any punishment from them would be to be getting two payments.

Therefore, O God, all thy holiness, all thy justice, not just thy mercy, not just thy mercy, not just thy love, all thy holiness, all thy justice, all of your nature demands that you see them as a beauty. Every other religion and probably most of you who went to churches, Christian churches believe the same thing. Every other religion thinks that when it comes to my relationship with God, it's sort of like a set of scales.

You see the set of scales, right? You know, in old courtrooms, they always have some blind lady or something like that. You know, the blindfold on with the blindfolds on with the scales.

And what does everybody think? Well, I have good deeds and bad deeds, and if I have more good deeds and bad deeds of my good deeds, I weigh my bad deeds, then God will deal with me. And Christianity says, the very holiness of God, the very righteousness of God, compared to which all the mountains of the world and all the planets of the world are like a piece of dust, are on your side now.

That's the reason why first John, if you think I'm exaggerating, first John 1 verse 8 says, if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. It doesn't say he's faithful and merciful. Oh, of course he is, but I didn't say that.

If he would not forgive, if he would not continually accept us, those of us who believed in Jesus Christ, he would be unjust. And that means his whole nature is now for us. Let me put it to you in a nutshell.

What power could turn the holiness, the righteousness, the vengeance, and the wrath of God against evil? What power could turn all that into mother's milk? What power in the whole universe could change things so that every bit of God's holiness now demands that he loves you like a mother?

It's the cross. There's a hymn that goes, what wondrousness, what mysteries in this appointment shine, my breaches of the law are his and all his obedience, mine. That's the gospel.

Lay your deadly doing down, down to Jesus' feet, stand in him and him alone, gloriously complete, and see if you see what he is and then see what he's done. You can start to live as you really are because the last part of verse 16 says something very simple. What does it say?

He says, thy walls are ever before me. Well, you wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Wait a minute. The walls are broken. No, they're not.

Not in God's mind. God says, I treat you the way you're going to be. I practice towards you, not the way you look right now, but the way you're going to be.

And that's what we're supposed to be doing. It's another way to put it. It's simply this.

We are supposed to also take what he has done for us and say, look, if this is how he sees me, then that's how I have to see myself. You have to apply this and it will do anything. When you suffer, what are you supposed to say?

Why have you forsaken me? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

That word forsaken that's used in verse 14 is also used in Psalm 21, verse 1. It's the very same word Jesus cried on the cross. Jesus Christ is saying, you are not forsaken.

I was forsaken. I was forsaken so that even when you're thrown into pits and you cry out and say, please don't sell me into slavery, God will never, never forget you. He'll never forget you because he forgot me.

And you must never act as if he has. What that means is, when no matter what you're suffering, you say, this can't be punishment. It's can't be punishment.

It's all fallen into the heart of Jesus. It can't be. When you feel guilty, you have to say, this can't bring me into condemnation.

And when you feel disappointment, when you feel discouraged, ultimately discouragement forsaken is always comes from this. Discouragement and forsakenness means, I'm sorry. I know this is going to be vivid, but this is the text.

When God says, you're going to mothers for something only I can give you. There is a milk that your soul needs. It's everlasting love.

Mother's love can't be everlasting. Even the mothers who are great die. And most mothers aren't great.

And whatever you're, if you're discouraged and you say, I'm forsaken, I'm forsaken, it's because there's something that you've made your mother instead of me. There's something that you say, if I have this, then I'm beautiful. You're only beautiful in me.

And that's the reason why he says, if you see in a sense this, no matter what your situation is, whether it's guilt, whether it's lack of self-control, whether it's suffering, no matter what it is, you apply this. Apply this. This is the health of my soul.

Can I just be honest? This is the health of my soul. Not just that in general, I'm living for Jesus, not just in general.

He forgives me when I fall down, but that every fiber of God's attributes are for me. Therefore, the stars will fall from heaven, but his love for me cannot change. On the basis of that, I have something to stand on.

Any other ground is sinking sand, some marsh, and it can be the healthier soul, too. Here's one less thing. I did use to have a house in which we had babies.

I just remember this. The only time whenever it was quiet, my gosh, it's quiet. I suddenly realized why.

It's because they were nursing. I mean, it was the only time they ever were, because they can't cry when they're nursing. How quiet is your soul?

This is what God is saying. If your soul's not quiet, if it's restless, if it's a mess, you don't know what it's like to know who he is, to see what he's done, and to practice who you are now in him. Because when you get a handle on that, you finally got the milk.

You're finally your soul's quieted. Let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would show us how this, how Jesus was destroyed by justice so that now justice is on our side, and your love for us is indestructible.

Would you please show us how that works out? Would you please show us how we can apply that? Father, this is a strong medicine.

It's the most difficult thing for many of us to grab hold on. We try to hold on to it, and we find that we have to beat it into our heads over and over again, and we lose our orientation towards so quickly. Would you, Lord, tonight, buy your grace and grave these truths into our hearts deeper than they've ever been engraved so that we can start to practice who we are and really see what you've done.

We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel Unliked Podcast.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。我们不需要走太远就能看到这个世界和我们自身出了什么问题，但是否有一种答案能触及根本，解释为何如此？今天的信息中，提摩西·基勒尔通过圣经中的故事探讨了人类的处境，并揭示了圣经对罪的看法以及它为何是唯一能够面对我们自己真相的深刻解释。我将从以赛亚书第49章读起，读到第16节。

这在你们的手册上有。我将读到第16节。这是耶和华说的： 正当我的良善时节，我要应允你；正当我救恩的日子，我要帮助你。我要保护你，使你成为与万民立约的磐石，为要恢复大地，安置荒凉之地的人口，对被囚禁的人说：出来吧！

对那些在黑暗中行走的人说：见光吧！他们将在路边喂养，也在每座荒山找到牧场。他们既不饥饿也不干渴；烈日和旷野的热气都不会伤害他们。有怜悯心肠的人会引导他们，并领他们到水泉旁。

我要使我的众山变为通路，修平我道路的崎岖。看哪，锡安说：耶和华离弃了我，耶和华忘记了我。难道母亲可以忘记吃奶的孩子吗？难道她能不怜悯自己所生的儿子吗？

虽然她可能忘记，但我却不忘记你。看哪，我将你刻在我的掌心上。你的城墙都在我的眼前。让我们在这里结束。

这是神的话语。现在，如果你这几周都来听讲了，你应该知道，这其实是关于圣经中对人类心灵、人类种族的罪恶问题的一系列讲解的最后部分。而如果你是这个系列的一部分，你需要知道，如果你一直跟着这个系列听讲，这就是最终的答案。实际上，当我们已经读到以赛亚书一段时间时，这里的内容是写给那些将要面对流放的人。

犹太人失去了耶路撒冷，这也是为什么会有关于锡安城墙的讨论的原因。锡安是指建有圣殿的那个山丘，有时也指代耶路撒冷这座城市。因此，当巴比伦帝国围攻并摧毁了耶路撒冷时，一切都毁了。耶路撒冷的城墙被摧毁，圣殿也被摧毁，人们被流放到异乡。

以赛亚书中的这段话是主对这些人的预言。在这里他提出了问题，并且给出了答案。问题是：我们该如何面对这一切？我们应该怎么做？

直到第13节，我们没有把这一整段都印出来，在这一章中，我们有典型的神学讨论。通过以赛亚，上帝说他会如何处理这个问题。从第8节开始，第49章的1到8节讲述了这个神秘人物——主仆人，他将要来，并且会遭受苦难。根据第9至12节的内容，作为结果，他将会聚集一个新的民族，从东方和西方（实际上是沙漠那边）以及北方和南方带来新人。

并且会有从黑暗中被带出来的人，被释放的人。因此，因为他的苦难，他将要建立一个新的团体。最后，在第13节，这个巨大的神学论述的高潮部分，我们被告知，通过仆人和这群人的工作，上帝将会做一件如此强大的事，以至于能够拯救整个世界。因为在这一段中，我们看到“喜乐”、“天”、“地”、“山岭”、“田野”，上帝实际上要更新整个创造。

无论上帝做什么，都将如此强大，以至于天地万物都会被更新，一切都会焕发出新的生机。这就是上帝所说的。这是多么宏伟！多么巨大！

这太宏大了，太大了！因为第14节直接击中了你的心。如果你在阅读这一章，你会感受到这一点，而我则无法通过这里的内容完全传达给你。但当你继续往下读时，你会发现上帝说：“我要这样做。

”“我要那样做。” 当然，在这段神学论述中，上帝正在召唤自然界开花赞美他。然后第14节出现了。那么第14节说了什么？

它说什么？听众们对上帝的回应是什么？他们说了什么？哇，不，他们说了什么？

看，我仍然很沮丧。这时，上帝说：“看看我要做的一切。”但经文却说：锡安说，“耶和华离弃了我；耶和华忘记了我。” 这里你看到的是，上帝向人们阐述了这一神学论述，而人们回应道：现实生活的困境压倒了那些遥远、抽象、远离的承诺。

你的所有神学理论。我只知道锡安倾覆了。我的生活破碎了。你怎么能让我经历这一切？

换句话说，上帝在这里给出了伟大的神学论述，但人们却说：“我还是很沮丧。”“你抛弃了我。” 你忘了我。我不知道你在说些什么，什么天地之间。

我不知道我是谁。我不知道这里发生了什么事。因此我们所面对的是工业级的沮丧，人的心灵。要让人心感到快乐和被爱是非常艰难的。

确实，有些人比其他人更糟糕。但基本上来说，听我说，你要对人的心灵这样说： 你是个耻辱。你是垃圾。你是可恶的。

这些话你永远不会忘记。你一辈子都不会忘记这样的话。但是你要对人的心灵说：你很棒，你很好。我喜欢你。

你需要这样的鼓励。这种感觉很快就会消逝。五分钟后，你就需要再次听到这样的话。否则你会忘了。

尽管有人声称爱，但人心还是会陷入沮丧中。那么神怎么办呢？我们来看看这里的情况。非常有趣的是，在第14节，我们看到一个人说，尽管有这些伟大的声明，我还是很沮丧，你并不爱我。

我不觉得被你抛弃了。我觉得你不忠于我。然后我们看到了神如何处理沮丧的心灵。这很有启发性。

神是如何做的呢？当一个人在绝望中感到沮丧时，神又是如何对待他的？首先，让我给你讲两个基本原则和三个具体原则。有两个基本的方法神与沮丧的人打交道。

然后有三项具体的行动。首先是两个**真正的一般原则，它们是**这样的： 首先，神会停下来。这可能不容易让你看到，除非你整章都读了，但神在前进的过程中看到了这一点。他在第1到13节中谈论了很多事情。

这一段的结构非常美妙。我今晚也不打算详细讨论它，因为我们不会过多关注这部分内容。但他实际上谈到了救赎历史中的三个伟大阶段：从十字架到新团体再到新创造，从十字架到团体再到新创造。真的非常美妙。

然后他突然停下来问：有什么问题吗？这就像当然有。他要我说，如果有任何问题，有人举手说：“我抑郁了。我绝望了。

” 我不明白你在说什么。我觉得被抛弃了。我觉得一切都完了。上帝停了下来。

因为第15节、第16节，事实上整章的内容都是如此。上帝停止了说话。祂改变了话题，因为当他们说“你忘了我”时，整章的其余内容都在谈论这个想法。换句话说，上帝让祂自己被中断了，祂停了下来。

这一点非常重要。最近我在思考自己的牧师生涯时意识到，无论你是男性还是女性，无论你的种族是什么，无论你的年龄如何，我们每个人都有我们特有的愚蠢之处。当我年轻的时候，我有一种倾向不去停下来。当有人沮丧地说话时，有一种倾向就是继续讲神学。

比如，让我把讲座说完吧。你知道的，你只是要靠信心战斗。你是被收养的家庭成员。你会统治和管理。

你知道的，你的神学。当你年轻时，作为年轻的牧师或年轻的团队成员，有一种倾向就是说：“我能解决这个问题。” 让我继续我的事工吧。让我把神学倾倒给你们吧。

但上帝停了下来。另一方面，随着我成为年长的牧者，很明显，我意识到自己仍然不想停下来，只是出于不同的原因。现在当你看到有人沮丧时，尽管有这些伟大的宣称，当你说“我知道基督教教导什么，我知道圣经说什么”，而你仍然感到抑郁时， 有一种倾向就是看轻他们说：“快点振作起来。” 但你知道，当你年长时，你见过人们如何度过难关，你会说：“来吧，你会挺过去的。

一切都会好起来的。” 你在为什幺自怜呢？比你更糟糕的问题人们都经历过，你们也度过了，我也经历过。所以当你年轻时，有一种倾向不去真正停下来倾听；当你年长时，也有种倾向不去真正停下来倾听。

我不知道什么时候才能成为一位好牧者。我知道的是，神是被打断的。祂停下来了。但另一个普遍的原则是，祂会停下来，也会争辩，因为第15节和第16节是在进行辩论。

第15节和第16节是充满对抗性的。第15节和第16节反驳了沮丧心灵的说法，并且这是完美的平衡，因为在另一方面，祂对心灵有同情心，但也在争辩。现在，如果你想要一个完美体现这个原则的例子，也就是这种平衡，无论你是自己处于沮丧中还是在帮助别人，最好的例子就是诗篇42篇，其中有一个诗人感到沮丧，他对自己说：“为什么你的心灵如此沮丧？为什么你的心灵如此沮丧？

” “为什么”这个词在他心里反复出现。现在，如果你仔细看看这里，这就是完美的平衡，因为在一方面，他在倾听心灵的声音；在另一方面，他又在与自己的心灵辩论：你的心灵为何如此沮丧？你在做什么？这就是我要说的原则，在我们进入具体细节之前，这是个普遍原则。

如果你不倾听自己的心灵，你会陷入心理的废墟。但如果只听从自己的心灵，你也同样会陷入心理的废墟。顺便提一句，几乎所有的人都会犯其中一种错误。有些人就是不愿意倾听，他们说：“哦，你知道，你啊，你啊，你否认它。

你没有，你知道，一点也不难过。” 我并不生气，我很安好，我很好。然后就一直忙碌着，不去坐下来倾听自己的心灵，不去找出问题到底有多严重？原因是什么？

所以很多人只是这样，你知道的，我们都是外向的人，所以我们出去做些事情吧，我会没事的。我们不倾听自己的心灵。另一方面，有些人则完全只听从自己的心灵。他们让心灵被遗忘，被抛弃。

你想知道化学反应吗？我被遗忘了，我被忽略了。现在听好了，如果你只听从你的心意，却不与它对话，也不去掌握它，只是说真话，那你就是脱离了现实。我意思是，你必须这样做。

如果你不这样做，如果你从来不倾听你的心声，或者只听从你的心而不去倾听，那么上帝所做的就是他会停下来倾听。他非常认真地对待这件事，但他也会争辩。这就是一般的原理。然而，当上帝面对沮丧的心时，他具体做了哪些事情呢？

有三件事情。你知道吗？正如我在开头暗示的那样，这三件事不仅治愈了沮丧的心，也治愈了罪恶的心。“忘记”和“弃绝”的词义不同。

“弃绝”更多是指外部行为，意味着你没有为我做些什么，但“忘记”更多是指内心的感受，即你已经拒绝了我。弃绝更侧重于缺乏关注，而忘记则更多是出于内心的排斥，因为你认为有问题，不是吗？我觉得自己不好。有时，沮丧更多的是愤怒而不是羞愧；有时则是更多的羞愧而不是愤怒。

它们虽然不同，但彼此非常接近。有时候很难分辨哪一个是主导情绪。所以当上帝面对沮丧的罪恶的心时，他要求我们做三件事。他让我们去做这三件事，并且这些都在第15和16节以及第16A中提到。

看吧，我直接告诉你这三件事是什么。他说：“想想你是谁。”“看看我是谁。”“看看我做了什么。

”然后实践你所是的样子。“现在，这里就是那三件事。” 首先，想想我是谁。他是谁呢？

在这里，上帝故意用了一个比喻来告诉我们关于他的一些信息。第15节说：母乳哺育的妇女难道会忘记吃奶的婴孩吗？她不会忘记，但我要不忘记你。那么，为什么上帝选择一个哺乳的母亲来描述他自己呢？

这不是感伤。事实上，这根本不是感伤。如果你想想看，他其实是在谈论那些有时会忘记的母亲。我意思是说，这不是在夸大其词。

这不是在说，没有什么能比得上母爱。这里并不是这个意思，因为确实有像母爱这样的东西。夫妻之间的爱当然也很深沉，可能更加丰富，也更有满足感。但上帝选择了这种特定的人类联系来告诉我们关于他自己的一些不可思议的事情。

好吧，这就是它的意义所在。哺乳的母亲与孩子之间的情感关系不是自愿的，也不是有条件的。它既非自愿也非有条件。你爱上某个人，选择那个人。

他们也选择你。你知道，你们做了什么，他们做了什么。如果他们没有回应，你就无法继续下去。好的，有条件，有意愿。

有选择，但有一种非常强大且几乎是自动的情感。母亲对孩子的爱是由她的本性驱动的，由她的生物学决定的。它是硬编码的。让我给你举三个例子。

首先，哺乳的母亲与孩子之间的关系是严格规律的。顺便说一句，我笑了一下。马修·亨利是一位清教徒，在17世纪90年代写了一篇注释。清教徒有点正统。

为什么一个男人会知道这一点呢？因为我了解他的妻子生了11个孩子。所以他在他的注释中这样说：哺乳的母亲，最不能忘记她的吮吸孩子的，因为如果她忘记了，自己的乳房很快就会提醒她。顺便说一句，对于你们中的某些人来说，这可能是个新消息。

除非哺乳的母亲定期哺乳她的孩子，除非她释放乳汁，满足孩子的需要，否则她会感到疼痛。你的乳房会痛。是的，男人和女人之间的爱。有些人可能会说，那是因为荷尔蒙，但天哪，这是真正的荷尔蒙作用。

你说，是荷尔蒙在驱动，但不是这样。每隔几个小时如果不满足这个心爱之人需要的话，就会痛苦不已，而且这种痛苦是异常规律的；其次，它又极其温柔和情感丰富。马太·亨利和我在与哺乳母亲交谈时学到的一件事是，除了乳汁之外，还伴随着巨大的养育感和情感。有时是乳汁带来了感觉，有时则是感觉和思绪引发了乳汁。

这是生物学的一部分，是荷尔蒙的作用，也是她作为一个人的本质——当她思考着充满爱的想法时，乳汁就会涌出，这是一种极大的温柔。她抱着这个婴儿，仔细端详每一个细节。她看每一根头发，每一片睫毛。她被自己所感动，对这个婴儿进行着极其细致和温柔的照料。

而且第三点是，它不仅规律得令人难以置信，而且极其情感丰富，但却完全无条件。当你与丈夫或妻子建立关系，或者浪漫地卷入某人时，必须要有某种相互性。然后对方就得有所回应。抱歉。

在第一次约会中，那个人甚至一句话都不说。你知道，那是一次糟糕的约会。但这里有一个女人，她被自己的本性所驱使，无条件地爱着这个新妈妈。你的生活停止了。

你生活中的一切都停了下来，完全围绕着这个小东西转。一周七天，一天二十四小时，一年三百六十五天，都是如此。而且孩子连打嗝都不说“谢谢”。谢谢你。

那些打嗝并不是在说“谢谢”。你可以想象得出来，但事实并非如此。孩子什么都不做，孩子的样子如何也无关紧要，孩子做得怎么样也不重要。它完全、彻底地规律，极其温柔，并且完全无条件。

你能想象上帝选择用这个来描述祂与我们之间的关系吗？这并不是唯一的形象，朋友们。当然我们知道还有其他形象可以表达这一理念。但你是否看到了这种力量呢？

祂说这就是我如何对待你们的方式。这只是一个我可以给你们的形象，让你们对我的爱有多强烈、多强大、多具体以及多么无条件有所了解。诗篇可以深刻地影响你与神的关系。甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。

在蒂姆和凯瑟琳·基勒的《一年365天灵修》中，你可以找到每天通过诗篇的阅读，获得新的圣经洞察。如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。而如果你已经花时间研读和祷告，那么阅读并祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与祂更深一层的亲密关系。作为您对福音与生命的礼物表示感谢的方式，我们将赠送您一本蒂姆和凯瑟琳·基勒的灵修书。

请访问gospelandlife.com/give 获取您的副本。今天就行动吧！现在是基勒博士继续今天的教导。因为你看，他说：“是的，她可能会忘记。

” 她看到了什么？他在说，他所表达的是，“是的，母亲不会忘记。” 意思是，天性只能到这个地步。有女性违背了天性，也有女性不做这件事。

但他想说的是简单的一点。他说：“我对你的爱不仅像母亲对孩子的自然之爱那样精确无误，而且它更是无限超越的。” 但你是否看到了**真正的要点？他不只是**说，“你看母亲的爱吧？

” 我的更强大。你看母亲的爱吧？我的更自由、更无条件。你看母亲的爱吧？

我的爱更具体。我在诗篇56中不是这样说吗？我知道有多少泪水顺着你的脸颊流下，连母亲都不知道。但他超越了这一点，并试图说：“我被驱使去爱你，就像一个母亲对她的孩子那样。

” 这是完全自然的。当他这么说时，有一些注释家帮助过我，他们指出这真是令人惊异，因为如果你仔细想想，特别是考虑到，这也是为什么这个讲道在上周讲完神的本性之后才进行的原因之一——神是圣洁的。他是法官。他是个怎样的神，我们之前讨论过。

他是个愤怒的神。他对邪恶感到愤怒。他是一个极其公正的神。在这一点上，你会怎么说？

如果神爱我们，那他一定违背了自己的本性。如果神爱我们，这当然是美好的，但同时他也违背了自己。然而，神说：“不。” 如果我不再爱你，我就不再是我自己。

我所有的一切，我的一切本质都驱使我绝对、强大、无条件地、温柔地、情感上地、规律地爱你。我感到痛苦。很难相信，他若不满足你的需要，他会感到痛苦。这怎么可能？

好吧，这就是第二点。第一点他说：“我是谁。”但除非你看到第二点——看我为你做了什么——否则你无法理解这一点。那么，他都做了什么呢？

参见第16节的第一句，这就是他在说的内容。你看？我把你们刻在我的掌心上。现在，这正是我们刚才提出的问题的答案。

怎么会这样呢？我知道，有些人可能会感到困惑。上周的主题就是，这是一个愤怒的神。而神说他是愤怒的神。

他说：“我是纯洁的眼睛，不能容忍罪恶。”而现在他又说，我的纯洁、我的本质已经使我变成一个比母亲对婴儿更强烈地渴望爱你的人。这怎么可能？答案在这里：看我为你做了什么。

我把你们刻在我的掌心上。那么，这个意思到底是什么？让我们把它分成两部分来理解：“刻在掌心”意味着什么呢？一切都在这里。

首先，“刻”的意思就是用锤子和凿子，在坚硬的东西上真正地雕刻出一些东西。这很奇怪。为什么呢？首先，刻写有两层含义。

第一，它是永久的。他把我们的名字刻在祂的手上，永远不会擦掉，也不会磨损。有时候你把东西放在手上，它可能会被水冲走；或者经过长时间使用而磨损掉。但我们却能从祂的手上抹去自己的名字。

但这不只是永久的。刻写这个词还意味着艺术性。祂没有说是在石头上凿刻的名字。刻写是一件艺术品。

这揭示了另一个圣经中的含义——我们的名字也被刻写在上面，就在出埃及记28章中提到的地方。在出埃及记28章中，我们被告知大祭司在进入会幕侍奉神时要佩戴以弗得（胸牌）。这个胸牌上有两块珍贵的宝石，镶嵌在金子中。所以它们非常美丽，在这些宝石上刻写了以色列儿女的名字。

为什么呢？因为这里有一个联系。出埃及记28章12节说，大祭司为什么要这样做呢？很简单，为了成为永恒的纪念物摆在耶和华面前。

纪念物。换句话说，每当神想起我们、想到我们时，祂看到的是美丽的事物。祂认为这是一种难以置信的美。现在听我说一下，这是一件其他宗教无法提供的事情，甚至很多在基督教教会中长大的人也从未真正理解过这一点。

这是一个令人震惊的声明。刻写意味着艺术品。这就是神的意思：你可以与我建立关系。你不仅被我容忍，也不仅仅是能接触我，更不是偶尔来获取我的恩赐。

你的关系不仅仅是在你死后才能享受祝福和乐园那么简单。他这样说，有可能与我建立一种关系，让我看着你时，是一种审美的体验。就像母亲看到孩子时，她会情不自禁地被孩子的可爱所吸引。上帝说，有可能与我建立一种关系，让我见到你时，被你的美丽深深打动，无法言表，难以理解，甚至难以置信，只是被你吸引。

这就是联系。我们是被刻印的，**这意味着我们是一种审美的体验。**另一种说法是：当上帝看着你时，他是什么样的？你是谁？

有可能与上帝建立一种关系，让你知道这一点——当他看你的时候，他会看到绝对的美丽。当然，如果上帝以这种方式看待你，那就是最终的看法。无论你的朋友怎么说，父母怎么说，镜子怎么说都无关紧要。即使你增重五磅，也无妨。

这些都不能改变这一点。这是终极的认知。这是终极的观点。你是终极的存在。

上帝说，是的，有可能与我建立一种关系，让你成为一件艺术品。当你问，这怎么可能时？答案是：在出埃及记28章中，几乎无法解释。我们怎么能如此美丽呢？

哦，对了，我们在这些美丽的宝石上被刻印在高高的前额上。这是多么美丽啊！这是多么美妙！这怎么可能？

你可能会觉得这太荒谬了。但在这里，我们看到另一件事：我们的名字被刻在他的手掌上，在掌心。首先，掌心是最显眼的地方。如果我在身体的其他地方刻字，我可能看不到它，但在我的掌心，我无法忽视它。

其次，**这意味着他所做的每一件事，他的手都是方式。**这就是我移动麦克风的方式。这是我看手表的样子。这里是我在关灯的方式：我必须用手掌。

而当神说，我要把你的名字刻在我的手掌上时，他所说的其实是一切我为你所做的。一切我所做的一切都是为了你。就像母亲一样，她所做的一切都是为了你。无论发生什么，一切都是为了你。

记得约瑟和他的兄弟们把他扔进了一个坑里？然后他们把他卖到埃及为奴隶。他在那个坑里哭泣着呼求他的兄弟和神。而神似乎没有记着他，也没有听见他。

但你看后来，约瑟意识到如果神真的回答了他的祷告，他就不会活到现在了。他也不会成为埃及的首相，也不会管理家庭救济计划，更不会拯救成千上万的人。甚至他的家人也可能会丧命。他和他的兄弟们也不会得到悔改的机会，他们就会在肉体和灵性上都死亡。

换句话说，当神似乎没有回答我的祷告时，其实是在记念我，一切他所做的都是为了我。这真是令人惊叹。你说，但这还不止于此。不只是说这些都在最显眼的地方——手掌的正面，而是在最活跃的地方，更是在最脆弱的地方。

你看，当有人张开手掌说：“听我说，看我的手掌”，这是跨文化的表示脆弱的方式。如果有人命令你举起双手，你不会像这样举起来。他们会直接对你开枪。也就是说，把手掌摊开意味着我没有武器。

摊开手掌意味着握手、欢迎、接纳。当我摊开手掌时，我就是最脆弱的。那么问题来了：为什么要把名字刻在手掌上呢？如果要用凿子雕刻，那真是糟糕透顶了。

确实很痛。许多世纪后，有人来到另一个怀疑者、一个沮丧的人面前，他的名字叫多马。他对多马说：“看看我的手掌。”当你看到耶稣基督时，请看看他手掌上的地方，找到你的名字，并且你会看到钉痕。

为什么？这就是我们为何在他眼中如此美丽的原因。我们之所以在上帝眼中如此美丽，是因为我们的名字被刻在比石头、比钻石更珍贵的东西上。耶稣的受难和钉痕是将我们的名字刻在他的手掌上的工具。

**这意味着，最后我们找到了15节为真的答案。**16000正是15节的答案。如果耶稣基督是我们大祭司，他站在上帝宝座前，并说：“看看我所做的一切。看看我的苦难。

看看我如何为你付出了代价。” 看看我所做的牺牲。你知道**这意味着什么吗？当我第一次听到耶稣基督是我们的大祭司时，这在希伯来书第7章中有所提及，它将影响整本希伯来书，并且在第二章第一节中说：“耶稣基督”只是一个形象，但正在传达一个信息。**

耶稣基督站在上帝的宝座前。他展示着伤口，并为我们恳求。当我第一次听到这个时，我说：“这很好，但这并不完全令人安慰。” 因为上帝最终会听从耶稣关于我的话多少次？

我一直在失败，一直在失败，每天早上耶稣都会说：“蒂姆又做了。” 但为了我的缘故，请继续爱他好吗？我看到上帝在宝座上说：“好吧。” 这正是错失了这段经文的全部意义。

现在当耶稣基督站在父的宝座前时，我们知道这一点。当他要求我们爱人如己时，并不是在乞求怜悯。你知道吗？他并不是在乞求怜悯。

他在要求公义。好的，请给我60秒。耶稣基督这样说，神的律法，人的死。因罪，我已经为他们偿还了一切债款。

他们信靠我，他们的债务已付清，因此，要从他们那里得到任何惩罚对你来说就是收取了两次付款。所以，神啊，你所有的圣洁，你所有的公义，不仅仅是你的怜悯，不仅仅是你的怜悯，不仅仅是你的爱，而是你所有的圣洁、公义，你本性的一切要求你将他们视为美丽。其他所有宗教，可能大多数去教堂的人，包括基督教的教会都相信这一点。其他所有宗教都认为，在我与神的关系中，就像一杆天平。

你看那杆天平吗？你知道，在旧时的法庭上，总是有蒙着眼睛的老妇人拿着天平。蒙着眼睛，手里拿着天平。大家认为呢？

我有善行和恶行，如果我的善行多于恶行，我就用善行抵消恶行，那么神就会处理我。基督教说，神的圣洁、公义，与世界上所有的山岳和行星相比，都是尘埃。现在站在你这边。这就是约翰一书1章8节所说的缘由，如果你认为我在夸大其词，约翰一书1章8节说：“我们若认自己的罪，神是信实的，是公义的，必要赦免我们的罪。

”它没有说他是怜悯的。当然他也是，但我没这么说。如果他不饶恕，如果我们这些相信耶稣基督的人得不到持续的接纳，他的确是不公平的。**这意味着他的整个本性现在都站在我们这边。**

让我用一句话总结一下。什么力量能够使神的圣洁、公义、愤怒和对恶的报复转向你？什么力量能使这一切变成母乳？宇宙中有什么力量能改变一切，使得神的每一点圣洁都要求他像母亲一样爱你？

是十字架。有一首赞美诗说：“奇妙何等，奥秘何深，在这盟约中彰显，我的罪孽是他受罚，他的顺服归我所有。”这就是福音。> 什么力量能够使神的圣洁、公义、愤怒和对恶的报复转向你？

什么力量能使这一切变成母乳？宇宙中有什么力量能改变一切，使得神的每一点圣洁都要求他像母亲一样爱你？是十字架。有一首赞美诗说：“奇妙何等，奥秘何深，在这盟约中彰显，我的罪孽是他受罚，他的顺服归我所有。

”这就是福音。放下你那致命的行为，把它放在耶稣的脚前，站在他里面，只有他，完全荣耀地站在那里，看看他是谁，然后看看他为你做了什么。你可以开始以真实的自己生活，因为第16节的最后一句话非常简单。它说了什么？

他说：“你的墙垣常在我面前。”等等，等等。等等，等等。墙垣已经破了。

不，没有。不是在神的心里。神说：“我对待你的方式是你将来会有的样子。我对你的态度不是你现在的样子，而是你将要成为的样子。

” 而这正是我们应该做的。这只是另一种说法。它就是这么简单： 我们也应该接受他为我们所做的一切，并说：“看哪，如果他是这样看待我的话，那么我也必须这样看待自己。”你必须应用这一点，这会改变一切。

当你受苦时，你应该说什么？为什么你离弃了我？等等，等等。那句“离弃”在第14节中使用，在诗篇21章1节中也用到了。

这是耶稣在十字架上喊叫的同一个词。耶稣基督说：“你没有被离弃。” 我是被离弃的。我是被离弃的，好让你即使落入坑中，呼求说“不要把我卖为奴隶”，神也不会忘记你。

他永远不会忘记你，因为他忘记了我。你也绝不能像这样行事。**这意味着，无论你遭受什么苦难，你都要说：“这不可能是惩罚。**”它不可能是惩罚。

这一切都已落在耶稣的心里了。它不可能是。当你感到内疚时，你必须说：“这不会使我受定罪。” 当你感到失望、气馁时，最终导致这种感觉的根源就是这个。

沮丧和被离弃意味着，“对不起”。我知道这会很鲜明，但这正是文本的意思。当神说：“我要为你做母亲才能做的事。”你的灵魂需要一种永恒的爱。

母爱是不能永恒的。即使是伟大的母亲也会死。而且大多数母亲都不伟大。无论你是谁，如果你感到沮丧，说：“我被遗弃了，我被遗弃了”，那是因为你把母亲的地位放在了我的上面。

你说，如果我有这个，我就美丽了。只有在我里面，你才是美丽的。所以他这样说：不论你的处境如何——是罪疚、缺乏自制力、痛苦，无论是什么，都要应用这一点。应用这一点。

这是我的灵魂的健康。我可以坦诚地说吗？这是我灵魂的健康。不只是说我在一般情况下为耶稣而活，不只是在一般情况下。

他在我跌倒时原谅了我，但上帝的所有属性都是为了我。因此，即使星辰从天际坠落，他对我的爱也不会改变。基于这一点，我们有了立足之地。还有什么可以少的呢？

我过去确实有一个房子，在那里我们生过孩子。我记得一件事：唯一安静的时候，天哪，真的很安静。我突然明白为什么了。那是因为他们在哺乳。

也就是说，那是他们唯一能安静的时候，因为她们在哺乳时不会哭。你的灵魂有多安静？这就是上帝所说的话。如果你的灵魂不安静，不安宁，一团糟，你就不知道认识他是什么感觉，看到他的所作所为，以及现在在他里面你是怎样的人。

因为你一旦掌握了这一点，你就真正得到了“奶”。你的心灵终于平静下来了。让我们祷告。我们亲爱的天父，请教导我们如何理解耶稣被正义摧毁，从而正义站在我们这边，你的爱对我们是不可摧毁的。

请让我们明白这如何运作，教会我们如何应用这一点。父亲，这是强效的药剂。这对我们中的许多人来说是最难抓住的东西。我们试图把握它，却发现我们必须一遍又一遍地把它印在脑子里，而我们的方向感却很快就会丧失。

主啊，今晚求你赐给我们恩典，把这些真理深深地刻入我们的心中，比以往任何时候都要深刻，好让我们开始实践我们是谁，并真正看到你为我们所做的一切。我们在耶稣的名里祷告。阿门。感谢大家收听《福音不合群播客》。
