# Life in the Spirit / Life in the Spirit

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel and Life. Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life?

The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture tonight comes from the Book of Ephesians, chapter 5 verses 15 through 21.

Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery.

Instead, be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Submit to one another out of reverence, poor Christ. This is the Word of the Lord. It's good to be with you back with you in order to look at this famous command by Paul.

He commands us to be filled with the Spirit. He doesn't say it would be a great thing to attain if you could. Try real hard, maybe you'll make it.

He commands, be filled with the Spirit. And I think the best way to go with this subject is to be as practical as we possibly can. So let's ask the text, this short little text, three questions.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? That's about as granular as I could make it.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? So first, what is being filled with the Spirit?

And let's look right at the center, right at the heart of the command, where Paul makes a comparison and a contrast. He says, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit. By the way, most commentators say that's rather surprising.

Why in the world that he brings getting drunk up? Why would he say, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit? And the answer is, there must be some way in which being drunk is like being filled with the Spirit and some way in which it's unlike.

There would be no need for a warning if there wasn't some similarity, but there also would be no warrant for the warning if there wasn't a dissimilarity. So let's ask that question, how is being drunk and being filled with the Spirit both like and unlike? And here's how it's like.

For in Acts chapter 2, Dave Pentecost, the first day that the Holy Spirit fell on the disciples, and they began to speak, began to speak. The word of God, they began to talk about God and his wonders about the gospel, and they did it with a boldness and with a joy and with a fluency that so impressed the crowd, the onlookers, that they said, what? And they became filled with the Spirit, what did the people who were watching them say?

These guys are drunk. Why? Because they were so brave and so happy, and the only time they ever see people as brave and as happy as people who are filled with the Spirit is people who are drunk.

That's the reason why they looked at people who are filled with the Spirit so these guys must be drunk. Why? Well, alcohol gets rid of your inhibitions.

The things that you're afraid of sort of melt away, and therefore there's a braveness and there's a happiness that very often isn't there if you're sober. When I was a pastor in my first church, was a small town in the south. There was a town drunk.

He actually had been raised at the church and most of the family were members of the church, and I think he was a member of the church. But he essentially lived on the street and nobody could get him to go into rehab. Nobody could get him to do what he really should do.

But I remember when I first met him, he showed up at the church because this is his church and I was the pastor. I didn't know who he was. I remember he sat down, and boy, I was impressed with him.

He didn't stagger, by the way. He said, I have done a lot of wrong things and he explained people he'd wrong, people he'd robbed from, women that he had wronged, and he says, I'm going to go to that person to make it right. I'm going to make that person make it right.

He would say, he's talking to a pastor. I'm going to do all these things. I'm going to make things right, and I'm ever saying, that's right, that's good.

That wasn't long after that that I found out from the rest of my congregation since I was brand new in town, that Carl only ever talked like that when he was drunk. He didn't stagger, so you couldn't tell right away unless you got up close and smelled him. But he was saying the right things.

He was willing to face the truth. He was willing to tell the truth. But as soon as he sobered up immediately, no way.

He wasn't going to do any of that stuff. All his fears rushed back and flooded him and kept him a slave. So being brave and being happy, evidently, is something that being drunk brings and also something that the spirit brings.

However, being filled with the spirit and being drunk are very unlike, of course, of course. And here's how. Paul seems to intuit what we know today empirically.

And that is that alcohol makes you brave and happy because it's a depressant. Did you know that? You can go look it up.

It's a chemical that actually is in the category of depressants. We say, well, if it's a depressant, how does it make you brave and happy? It depresses parts of the brain.

So it diminishes brain function. It diminishes brain ability so that a drunk person sees less of reality than you did before. And the things that we were afraid of and the things that were inhibiting you, they sort of melt away.

And then you're brave and happy. In other words, alcohol makes you brave and happy by depressing your brain and showing you less of reality. But the fullness of the spirit operates in exactly the opposite way.

Look at verse 15, 16 and 17. Looking up to Paul's command to be filled with the spirit, he is saying to the Ephesian Christians, he's saying, look at three things. He says, I want you to be wise.

Verse 15. Not foolish. He also says, I want you to be very careful in verse 15.

But that literally means I want you to be intensely aware. It's a word that means, literally it says, I want you to walk circumspecly. It means I want you to be utterly and intensely aware of things around you.

And then of course, it says, I want you to understand, understanding wisdom, intense awareness of what's going on, Paul is seeking a higher level of mental functioning. And where are we going to get that? Verse 18, be filled with the spirit.

Because the fullness of the spirit, unlike alcohol, doesn't make you brave and happy, doesn't make you joyful and courageous and joyful by showing you less of reality but by showing you more. And let me give you a perfect concrete illustration of that. Elisha, the great prophet, 2 Kings chapter 6.

He was in a city with his servant, he had a servant. And the city was surrounded by enemies, enemy troops that were, it was an overwhelming force that we're going to come upon the city tomorrow the next day. What Elisha was feeling okay?

Elisha had confidence, Elisha had courage, Elisha had joy, and the servant is just melting down with fear. And he says, how can you act like this, Elisha? Now Elisha could have done two things to help the servant face that night and the next day.

One is he could have given him a bottle of alcohol, and he could have said, hey, go get drunk. Because that would have shown him less of reality and it would have enabled him, perhaps, to face the future with a little more courage and a little more joy, but that's not what he did. Oh no, what did Elisha do?

He prayed to God and he said, oh Lord, open his eyes. Show him all of reality, not just the material but the spiritual, the supernatural, show him all of reality. And God opened his eyes, and in a very famous phrase, he saw chariots of fire on the mountains around the city.

In other words, he saw the hosts of God, he saw the angels, he saw the supernatural world. And he began to realize God is real and God is there and God is working a plan and God has his power, and that's the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is not giving you joy and courage by showing you less of reality but by showing you more of reality, showing what God and what he's doing and his plans and all that.

And therefore we're back to what we said at the very beginning of this series on the Holy Spirit. We were in the summer when we were looking at chapters in the book of John, 14, 15, 16, where Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take what I'm telling you, what I've done.

He will take of mine and show it to you. The Holy Spirit's job is to take all the things that God is doing, all the things that God has done in Christ, all the things that Christ has done for you, all the things that you are in Christ. And it makes the Holy Spirit's job is to take all that and to communicate it to you, to make it so true to your mind, to the reason of your mind.

And so real to the deepest emotions of your heart, that who God is and what He has done and especially what He's done in Christ becomes the controlling power in your life. It dominates you. So the things that used to deflate you, don't deflate you, the things that used to inflate you, don't scare you anymore, because you see all of reality.

Alcohol is a depressant. It gets rid of negative thoughts. It gets rid of fears by depressing parts of your brain, showing you less of reality.

But here's what the fullness of the Spirit is. The fullness of the Spirit is not a frothy joy that helps you forget your troubles. No, in a very famous spot, C.

S. Lewis said, I didn't go to Christianity to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of port would do that.

If you want to make yourself happy and comfortable, I don't recommend Christianity. The fullness of the Spirit does not give you a frothy joy to make you forget your troubles, it gives you a heightened intense understanding of the truth and who God is and what He's doing in the world that enables you to triumph over your troubles. The fullness of the Spirit is a supernaturally charged cognition, which brings about a heart condition of courage and joy.

It's a heightened, intensified, existential moment-by-moment awareness of God in a salvation that dominates your life so that nothing else does. So that no fears do. No danger does.

Nothing does because you see all of reality. That's the fullness of the Spirit. Now, secondly, how do you know if you have the fullness of the Spirit?

What are the marks of a person who has it? Now, usually when people teach or preach on the being filled with the Spirit, they start with verse 18. I rather deliberately included verses 15, 16, 17, their run-up.

And the reason I did is because there you have Paul talking about wisdom and then saying, now, if you want wisdom, be filled with the Spirit. What I see in verses 15 all the way to 21 is the results of the fullness of the Spirit is a kind of almost what looks to us like a contradiction. There is a humble realism along with a surging joy, a humble realism along with a surging joy.

So for example, wisdom, what is that? Now, you know, that's a huge subject, but at least we know this from the Bible. To be wisdom means to be down to earth, to be wise means to be realistic, not idealistic, not naive, not having rosy colored glasses.

A wise person is savvy, a wise person knows how things work. A wise person knows what life is really like, reality, words and all. And look at the very end of the passage where it says, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Submission means humble yourself before other people. Why? Out of reverence, out of this sense of awe and reverence, you have this humility before Christ.

See, being filled with the Spirit rightly is associated with joy, but we're also seeing that spiritual joy is accompanied by a humble realism. Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 6, we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing. We're sorrowful yet always rejoicing, we're poor yet we possess everything.

In other words, we're often sad but we're never really unhappy. What is he talking about? The fullness of the Spirit brings you a joy based on God.

It's a heightened understanding of God. It's a supernaturally charged cognition about God and His salvation. Whereas most of our, I don't know how to put it, the alternatives to being filled with the Spirit is getting high, getting high on a drug, getting high on alcohol, or even getting high on your own success.

When people say, I'm on a roll. I'm not thinking negative thoughts. I'm not thinking about my flaws.

I'm thinking about my strengths, positive thinking. Get rid of negative thoughts. That's not the fullness of the Spirit because the fullness of the Spirit enhances realism.

It enhances humility. The reason why you still have joy is because it's not looking at you and hey, you're on a roll. It's looking at God, which means that the joy of the Holy Spirit is like the stars because the stars get brighter and brighter as the night gets darker.

And the joy that comes from the fullness of the Spirit goes hand in hand with a wisdom and a realism and humility. And it can get actually stronger that joy can get stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

So first there's a humble realism but then on the other hand, yes, there is this surging joy. It's all here in 19 and 20. And since this is actually all one sentence in the Greek, what you see in verses 19, 20 and 21 flow out of the command to be filled with the spirit.

That's not as clear in the English because these are all broken into separate sentences. But you see, we're supposed to, let me work backwards. All a person filled with the spirit always gives thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Boy, now there we go. Now you begin to see how you could possibly have a joy that gets like the stars that gets brighter and stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. Because here it says we must, a person filled with the spirit can always give thanks to God the Father for everything.

Now how is that possible? How is it possible to always have a grateful joy no matter how bad things are? And the answer is right at the very end in the name of Jesus.

See, in the name, the word in the Bible name means your character. And when the Holy Spirit is filling you, when the Holy Spirit is coming and glorifying Jesus and showing you what Jesus does, it drives you, the Holy Spirit, he drives you into the name of Jesus, who he is and what he's done. And here's one of the things you will see.

God hates evil. If God did not hate evil, he would not have sent his only son. There's no reason why he would ever send his only son to the world.

He hates the evil. He hates the disease. He hates the suffering and the death that's here.

He didn't make a world filled with these things. And yet how does God bring about our salvation? How does he give us life?

How does he bring us glory? By horrible things happening to Jesus Christ. God brings death out of life.

Part of me, he brings life out of death. He brings glory out of suffering. He brings salvation out of rejection.

All these awful things. It grieves God to see evil. And it has particularly grieved God to see evil fall in his only son.

And yet when the Holy Spirit, as the years go by, shows you more and more and more of the genius of the cross, of the genius of what God has done and the wisdom of what has God has done on the cross. And when you see how God brings more glory and more joy into the world because of the suffering of Jesus when suffering hits you, you're going to start to say, I don't know what you're doing, but I thank you. I know you're working.

And see, if you have that, if the Spirit has glorified Jesus to the place where you can thank God, always in everything, then you become a person who sings and makes music in your heart to the Lord. Actually, I love that verse. If you read right by that, and it looks a little bit fru-fru, doesn't it kind of sing and make melody in your heart, but however, notice it's not saying this is a person who's thinking about God, but who is communicating to God.

And I think this verse means this. The sing and make music in your heart to the Lord means. This is a person who so has a sense of God's presence and such a delight in God's actual presence.

That that person would put it into a song if he could. It's to live in the presence of God with such delight that you would sing about it if you could. You'd put it into a song if you possibly could.

Being filled with a Spirit means God is near. Being filled with a Spirit means you sense the nearness of God and you delight in the nearness of God and you would sing about it if you could, and sometimes we sing about even though we can't. It sounds horrible to everybody, probably even to God, but it doesn't matter.

And of course being filled with a Spirit means, therefore, that since we can thank God in all circumstances, and since we delight in His presence moment by moment, we become people who speak to one another with Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. I actually preached an entire sermon on that two years ago, and I can't recap it now, but that verse means not only that people fill with a Spirit, love music, and need to express their joy in God through music, but it also is talking about singing to one another, not just singing to God. And what that means is, Spirit filled people edify each other.

Spirit filled people are constantly talking about what God is doing in their lives to one another and helping us find God in new ways ourselves, because our friends around us are speaking to us about it. And the Spirit filled people create an incredible kind of Christian community. So here it is, humble realism, along with the searching joy.

Is your joy like that? Do you have a joy like that? It's like the stars.

I think it's brighter as the circumstances of your life get darker. Now if that's the fullness of the Spirit, I doubt that there's anybody here who doesn't fall into one of two categories. Either you're either going to say, I don't know anything of this at all, or you're going to say, I don't know nearly as much of it as I want.

So point three, how can we become filled with the Spirit? Oh my. Let me just let me take you to one place in the Bible that about 10 years ago hit me with all the force of a hammer.

We tend not to think about Jesus as being filled with the Spirit, perhaps. Yes, we always know about the baptism and the Spirit came down to annoy him for his ministry as baptism. But Jesus Christ spends most of his time weeping.

He's always a man of sorrows. He's weeping over Lazarus. He's weeping over Jerusalem.

He's a man of sorrows. But there is an amazing spot. It's related in Luke chapter 10 and also Matthew 11, where we're told Jesus exalted, exploded with joy in the Holy Spirit.

Jesus has an experience of the fullness of the Spirit. And this is what it says. This is Luke chapter 10.

He says, at that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Ghost, exalted and said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Listen to it again.

Jesus full of joy through the Holy Spirit exalted and said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Jesus has an explosion of joy.

Why? It's very interesting. He's full of the Holy Spirit and the joy of the Holy Spirit.

That's what Paul's talking about here. How did it happen? Here's how it happened.

He's noticing something. First of all, we learn here that if you find God, it's not because you reach him or you attain him, or you rise up toward him. Oh no, the only way anybody finds God is if God reveals himself, if God unveils himself to you.

But, who does he reveal himself to? He doesn't reveal himself to the learned. He doesn't reveal himself to the people who are wise in their own eyes.

He doesn't reveal himself to the accomplished, to the people who say, look at my accomplishments, look at my morality, look at my talent. He reveals himself to little children at a spiritual phrase, of course, in Jesus, the helpless, the weak, the people who know they've got nothing, the people who know they're spiritually bankrupt. So you know what Jesus is saying?

He's saying, I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace. And you don't divide the world into the good and the bad. You divide the world into the proud and the helpless.

I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace and you say by grace not by works. And Jesus looked at the gospel. He looked at grace and it filled him with the Holy Spirit.

Now look, Jesus is perfect. Jesus is right with God. Why would Jesus need the fullness of the Holy Spirit?

All I know is that even Jesus needed the fullness of the Holy Spirit to get through his life, to face the things he was facing. He literally had the whole way to the world put on him, but he was able to bear it because he had the fullness of the Spirit. Well, how did he get it?

He looked at grace. He looked at the gospel. Okay, look at this.

Let's do it right now. Psalm 51, David says to God, desperately, do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Oh, Lord, do not take your Holy Spirit from me.

Take not the Holy Spirit from me. Why? Why was he afraid?

Because he'd sinned and see Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God is holy. And the Spirit of God cannot dwell with sin. And David knew that.

And David knew that he was about to be abandoned. He deserved to be abandoned by the Spirit of God, with all of his joy, with all of his power. And that would have finished David as a king.

He just, take not the Holy Spirit from me. I deserve to have the Holy Spirit taken from me, but take not the Holy Spirit from me. And guess what?

God did not take the Holy Spirit from him. Holy Spirit stayed with him, even though he was a sinner, even though he deserved abandonment. So there's this sinful David, says, take not the Holy Spirit from me, and God didn't.

Centuries later, the ultimate David, the greater David, the descendant of David, the sinless Jesus Christ, the true king, says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? You know what he's saying? He's saying, take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

Take not thy face from me. Take not thy presence from me. Don't take it away from me, but God did.

Why? You know, the sinful David deserved to lose the Holy Spirit. The sinless, ultimate greater David did not deserve to lose the Holy Spirit, but the sinful David kept the fullness of the Spirit and the sinless David, Jesus Christ lost the fullness of the Spirit.

Why? Because Jesus Christ was standing in our place and he was abandoned. He got the abandonment that David deserved, that you and I deserve.

Why? So he lost the fullness of the Spirit so you and I could have it even though we're sinners. Look at that.

Look at that and say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you've saved me by grace. Are you bored? Is there a deadness in your heart right now?

It's because you're forgetting grace. It's not real to your heart. Are you having trouble loving anybody?

Are you feeling really, are you looking down at people? Are you angry at people? It's because you've forgotten grace.

It hasn't melted and humbled your heart. Are you anxious? Are you afraid God's going to let you down?

It's because you've forgotten grace. You've forgotten the fact that God was not going to abandon you. Look at what he's done for you on the cross.

Look at grace, grace, grace until there's an explosion of joy to joy of the Holy Spirit. Do you want to be filled with the Spirit? First, you have to be filled with Christ.

You have to become a little child. You have to rely on him alone for salvation. You have to stop saying, oh, Lord, please receive me because what I've done or who I am.

You've got to say, oh, Lord, please receive me just by grace because of what Jesus has done. So in order to be filled with the Spirit, first, you have to be filled with Christ. But then, you've got to take time.

You've got to take time morning and evening and maybe in the middle of the day. You've got to set aside time for you to look at the truth of the Bible. The truth of God in general and the truth of the gospel in particular.

And study it and know it and meditate on it and ask the Spirit to ignite it in you. There's no, listen, it's not like, oh, you have your doctrine in all your truth, but I'm interested in mystical experience. No, the Holy Spirit, the experience, the spirit is the truth on fire in your life.

It's theology on fire in your life. And that takes study and that takes prayer and that takes the means of grace and that takes the spiritual disciplines of prayer and of worship, of study and of group prayer and of individual prayer and of corporate prayer. I can't just drop in on church a couple of times a month and hope for some inspiration and expect the fullness of the Spirit.

Look at what Jesus Christ has done systematically, thematically in a disciplined way until you can say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth that you are God of grace and you've been a God of grace to me. Let's pray, our Father, we are so grateful that you're a God of grace and you don't divide the world into the good and the bad but you divide the world into the proud and the helpless. The people who don't think they need grace and the people who do know that they need grace.

And we thank you that you have been willing to come into our lives, but we also know that we don't experience this humble realism in searching joy, this heightened supernaturally charged cognition. We have not made ourselves available to it and we ask that your Holy Spirit would fill us. Fill us.

And that we go on being filled with your Spirit so that we also can become a congregation of people who sing to one another and speak to one another and build each other up in love. So, Father, help us to apply all these things through the inspiration of your Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus we ask it. Amen.

欢迎来到福音与生命。圣灵是谁？为什么圣灵的工作对基督徒的生活如此重要？圣经告诉我们，圣灵不只是一个模糊的力量，而是一个在基督徒生活中以深刻方式工作的有位格的人。

今天，提摩太·基尔正在探讨圣灵如何呼召我们信靠他、使我们联合在一起、赋予我们恩赐并塑造我们成为更多像基督的人。今晚的经文来自《以弗所书》第五章15至21节。所以你们要谨慎怎样行事，在智慧上作神的儿女。因为这段日子邪恶，所以不要愚昧，倒要明白主的心意。

不要醉酒，醉酒使人放荡； 但要被圣灵充满。要用诗篇、颂词、心灵的话彼此讲说，歌颂主耶稣基督。凡事要感谢神，这是就着我们的主耶稣基督在父面前说的。你们当存敬畏的心彼此顺服。

这就是主的话语。很高兴再次与你们相聚，一同探讨保罗这位著名命令的内容。他命令我们被圣灵充满。他没有说如果我们能做到的话，这会是一件很棒的事情。

努力尝试，也许你能做到。他命令我们要被圣灵充满。我认为处理这个话题的最好方式是尽可能地实用。让我们问这段简短的文字三个问题。

什么是被圣灵充满？我们如何知道是否被圣灵充满，以及如何变得被圣灵充满？这已经足够具体了。什么是被圣灵充满？

我们如何知道是否被圣灵充满，以及如何变得被圣灵充满？首先，什么是被圣灵充满？让我们直接看命令的中心部分，保罗所做的对比和对照。他说：“不要醉酒，要被圣灵充满。

”顺便说一句，大多数注释家都认为这是相当令人惊讶的。为什么他会提到醉酒？又为什么说不要借着酒力醉倒，而是要被圣灵充满呢？答案是：醉酒和被圣灵充满之间必定有相似之处，也有不同之处。

如果没有相似性，就没有必要发出警告；如果没有差异性，也没有发出警告的根据。让我们来探讨一下这两种状态之间的相似点与不同点。首先看它们的相似之处： 在使徒行传第二章中，当圣灵第一次降在使徒身上时，他们开始说话，谈论上帝和他的奇妙作为，讲道充满勇气、欢乐和流畅，深深打动了旁观者的心。人们说：“这些人是怎么回事？

”因为他们被圣灵充满，旁观的人们为什么会认为他们是醉酒呢？因为他们在勇敢和快乐方面表现得如此突出，而只有在被圣灵充满时，他们才会表现出这种状态。酒精的作用是消除你的戒心，让你害怕的事情变得不再重要。因此，在清醒时很难达到的勇气与欢乐，在喝醉后却常常会出现。

在我第一次担任牧师的时候，是在南部的一个小镇。镇上有个常喝酒的人，他实际上是被教会抚养长大的，家里的大部分人都在教会里，我想他也算是教会成员之一。但他的生活实际上是在街头度过的，没有人能说服他去戒酒或接受治疗。我记得我第一次见到他时，他出现在教堂门口，因为这是他的教会，而我是牧师。

我不知道他是谁。我记得他坐下后，我对他印象深刻。> 为什么人们会认为他们醉了？因为他们在勇敢和快乐方面表现得如此突出，而这正是在被圣灵充满的人身上才会看到的状态。

他没有踉跄。他说：“我做了很多错事，我要去向那些被我伤害的人道歉，向那些我抢劫过的人道歉，还有那些我伤害过的女人。”然后他说：“我要去找他们把事情解决好。” 他对牧师说：“我要去做这些事情，我要把这些事情解决好。

”牧师说：“很好，很好。” 后来我发现，在我刚搬到这个镇子不久后，其他会众告诉我卡尔只有在喝醉的时候才会这么说。他没有踉跄，所以一开始你可能看不出来，除非你靠近了闻到他身上的酒味。但他确实说了正确的话。

他愿意面对真相，愿意说出真相。但是一旦清醒过来，他就什么都不会做了。所有的恐惧又涌上心头，把他变成了奴隶。显然，勇敢和快乐显然是醉酒带来的，也是圣灵带来的。

不过，被圣灵充满和喝醉是截然不同的两回事。当然，当然。保罗似乎预见到我们今天通过实验知道的事实： 酒精会让你变得勇敢和快乐，因为它是一种抑制剂。你知道吗？

你可以查一下资料。它实际上属于抑制剂类化学物质。我们说，如果它是抑制剂，那它是如何让你变得勇敢和快乐的呢？因为它会抑制大脑的部分功能。

所以它会降低脑功能，使醉酒的人看到的世界比清醒时要少一些。那些让我们害怕的事物和阻碍你的东西开始消失。于是你感到勇敢和快乐。换句话说，酒精通过抑制大脑、减少你对现实的认知让你变得勇敢和快乐。

但圣灵的充满则完全相反。看看第15、16和17节。保罗命令信徒被圣灵充满时，他告诉以弗所基督徒三件事：他说：“我希望你们聪明。” 经文15节。

保罗说，不要愚昧。他也在这一节中强调要你们非常小心。但这个词实际上的意思是，我要你们高度警觉。它是一个词，直译就是，我要你们谨慎行事。

意思是，我要你们对周围的事物有极度的警觉。然后当然，保罗还说，我要你们明白，理解智慧，即深刻地了解正在发生的事情。保罗希望达到更高的精神境界。那么我们从哪里获得这种境界呢？

经文18节，要被圣灵充满。因为圣灵的丰满与酒精不同，并不会让你变得勇敢和快乐，不会让你感到欢乐和勇气倍增，而是通过展示更多的现实来帮助你更加深刻地了解它。让我给你们举一个完美的具体例子。以利亚，伟大的先知，在《列王纪》第六章中。

他和他的仆人在一座被敌人包围的城市里。这座城市被敌军围困，他们人数众多，明天就会攻城。那么以利亚当时的心情如何呢？以利亚充满信心，以利亚勇敢且快乐，而他的仆人却惊恐万分。

仆人说：“你为什么这么镇定？” 以利亚可以做两件事来帮助仆人在那个夜晚和第二天面对这一切。一是给他一瓶酒，让他喝醉。因为这样可能会减少他所看到的现实，使他在未来能够更加勇敢和快乐地面对，但这不是他做的。

不，以利亚做了什么？他向上帝祷告说：“主啊，请打开他的眼睛，让他看见所有的真实，不仅是物质的，还有灵性的、超自然的，让他看见所有的现实。” 神就打开了仆人的双眼，在一个著名的短语中，他说：“他看见了山上的战车和火焰。” 这样，以利亚不仅为自己的信心感到自豪，也为能够帮助仆人看到更广阔的世界而感到喜悦。

换句话说，他看到了上帝的军队，看到了天使，看到了超自然的世界。于是他开始意识到，上帝是真实的，上帝是存在的，并且在制定计划，上帝拥有他的力量，这就是圣灵的丰满。圣灵的丰满不是通过减少现实来给你带来喜乐和勇气，而是通过展示更多的现实，让你看到上帝和他的作为、他的计划等等。因此我们回到了这个关于圣灵系列讲道的开头部分。

那时我们在夏天，正在研读约翰福音14、15、16章的内容，耶稣说，当圣灵降临的时候，他会荣耀我。他会把我要告诉你们的，我已经做的事情带出来给你们看。他要把我的一切带出来给你们看，并且展示给你们。圣灵的工作就是将上帝所做的一切，基督在其中所做的这一切，以及你通过基督所拥有的这一切，全部带出来并传达给你，使这些事情对你的心智来说是真实的，对你的理性来说也是真实的。

这样，这些事情就会深深地影响你最深层的情感，让你真正理解谁是上帝，他做了什么，特别是在基督里做了什么。这会使上帝成为你生活的控制力量，占据主导地位。以前那些让你沮丧的事情不再会让你沮丧，以前那些让你兴奋的事情也不再会吓到你，因为你看到了整个现实。酒精是一种抑制剂，它通过抑制大脑的某些部分来消除负面想法和恐惧，从而减少现实感。

但圣灵的丰满是什么呢？圣灵的丰满不是一种泡沫般的喜悦，帮助你忘记烦恼。不，在一个非常著名的段落中，C.S.刘易斯说过：“我并不是因为基督教能让我快乐才去信仰它的。”我一直知道一瓶波特酒就能做到这一点。

如果你想要让自己快乐和舒适，我不推荐基督教。圣灵的丰满并不会给你一种泡沫般的欢乐让你忘记烦恼，而是赋予你对真理和上帝的认识以及祂在世界中的作为，使你能战胜一切困难。圣灵的丰满是一种超自然的认知能力，带来勇气与喜乐的心。这是一种提升、强化的存在时刻意识，让你在救恩中占据主导地位，以至于其他一切都无法动摇。

因此，恐惧不会动摇你，危险也不会动摇你。因为你会看到现实的全貌。这就是圣灵的丰满。其次，你怎么知道你是否拥有圣灵的丰满呢？

一个拥有它的人有什么特征？通常当人们讲到被圣灵充满时，他们都会从第18节开始讲起。我特意包括了第15、16、17节，因为在那里保罗提到了智慧，并且说：“如果你想要智慧，就要被圣灵充满。”我发现从第15节到21节的内容中，圣灵的丰满带来的结果似乎有些自相矛盾：谦卑而现实的同时伴随着高涨的喜乐。

例如，智慧是什么？虽然这是一个很大的话题，但至少我们知道这一点：智慧意味着脚踏实地。智慧意味着现实而不理想化、不天真、不戴着玫瑰色的眼镜看世界。一个明智的人是精明的，他知道事情是如何运作的；一个明智的人知道生活的真相，包括它的艰辛和真实。

看看这段话的最后一部分：“彼此顺服，互相爱重。” 顺服意味着在基督面前谦卑自己。为什么？出于敬畏和敬虔的心态，你对基督有一种谦卑的态度。

看看，被圣灵充满正确的方式与喜乐相关联，但我们也能看到属灵的喜乐伴随着谦卑的现实感。保罗在哥林多后书6章中说：“我们在困苦中仍有欢笑，在患难中却指望神。”我们忧愁却不绝望，贫穷却富有。换句话说，我们常常感到悲伤，但绝不会真正地不快乐。

他在说什么？圣灵充满带来的喜乐是基于上帝的喜乐。这是一种对上帝更深的理解。是一种超自然的认知能力，关于上帝和他的救赎。

而大多数人的替代选择则是“上瘾”，可能是药物上的瘾，可能是酒精上的瘾，甚至可能是成功上的瘾。当人们说：“我状态很好。”“我没有消极的想法。”“我不再思考我的缺点。

” 而是想着自己的优点，积极思考。“摆脱消极想法”。这不是圣灵充满的状态，因为圣灵充满会增强现实感。它增强了谦卑。

你仍然感到喜乐的原因是这种喜乐不是基于你自己和你的成功。而是基于上帝。因此，圣灵的喜乐就像星星一样，在夜晚越黑暗时就越明亮。从圣灵充满中来的喜乐伴随着智慧、现实感和谦卑，并且在生活中的困境加深时，这种喜乐反而会变得更加强烈。

诗篇可以深刻地影响你对上帝的看法。甚至耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。在提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的《365日灵修》中，你可以找到每天通过诗篇的新颖圣经洞察。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。
