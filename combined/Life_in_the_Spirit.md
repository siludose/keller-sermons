Welcome to Gospel and Life. Who is the Holy Spirit? And why is the Spirit's work so vital to the Christian life?

The Bible tells us the Holy Spirit is not just a vague force, but a person who works in the lives of Christians in profound ways. Today Tim Keller is exploring how the Spirit calls us to faith, unites us together, equips us with gifts and shapes us to be more like Christ. Our scripture tonight comes from the Book of Ephesians, chapter 5 verses 15 through 21.

Be very careful then how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery.

Instead, be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another with Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Submit to one another out of reverence, poor Christ. This is the Word of the Lord. It's good to be with you back with you in order to look at this famous command by Paul.

He commands us to be filled with the Spirit. He doesn't say it would be a great thing to attain if you could. Try real hard, maybe you'll make it.

He commands, be filled with the Spirit. And I think the best way to go with this subject is to be as practical as we possibly can. So let's ask the text, this short little text, three questions.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? That's about as granular as I could make it.

What is being filled with the Spirit? How do we know if we are filled with the Spirit and how can we become filled with the Spirit? So first, what is being filled with the Spirit?

And let's look right at the center, right at the heart of the command, where Paul makes a comparison and a contrast. He says, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit. By the way, most commentators say that's rather surprising.

Why in the world that he brings getting drunk up? Why would he say, don't be drunk with wine, but be filled with the Spirit? And the answer is, there must be some way in which being drunk is like being filled with the Spirit and some way in which it's unlike.

There would be no need for a warning if there wasn't some similarity, but there also would be no warrant for the warning if there wasn't a dissimilarity. So let's ask that question, how is being drunk and being filled with the Spirit both like and unlike? And here's how it's like.

For in Acts chapter 2, Dave Pentecost, the first day that the Holy Spirit fell on the disciples, and they began to speak, began to speak. The word of God, they began to talk about God and his wonders about the gospel, and they did it with a boldness and with a joy and with a fluency that so impressed the crowd, the onlookers, that they said, what? And they became filled with the Spirit, what did the people who were watching them say?

These guys are drunk. Why? Because they were so brave and so happy, and the only time they ever see people as brave and as happy as people who are filled with the Spirit is people who are drunk.

That's the reason why they looked at people who are filled with the Spirit so these guys must be drunk. Why? Well, alcohol gets rid of your inhibitions.

The things that you're afraid of sort of melt away, and therefore there's a braveness and there's a happiness that very often isn't there if you're sober. When I was a pastor in my first church, was a small town in the south. There was a town drunk.

He actually had been raised at the church and most of the family were members of the church, and I think he was a member of the church. But he essentially lived on the street and nobody could get him to go into rehab. Nobody could get him to do what he really should do.

But I remember when I first met him, he showed up at the church because this is his church and I was the pastor. I didn't know who he was. I remember he sat down, and boy, I was impressed with him.

He didn't stagger, by the way. He said, I have done a lot of wrong things and he explained people he'd wrong, people he'd robbed from, women that he had wronged, and he says, I'm going to go to that person to make it right. I'm going to make that person make it right.

He would say, he's talking to a pastor. I'm going to do all these things. I'm going to make things right, and I'm ever saying, that's right, that's good.

That wasn't long after that that I found out from the rest of my congregation since I was brand new in town, that Carl only ever talked like that when he was drunk. He didn't stagger, so you couldn't tell right away unless you got up close and smelled him. But he was saying the right things.

He was willing to face the truth. He was willing to tell the truth. But as soon as he sobered up immediately, no way.

He wasn't going to do any of that stuff. All his fears rushed back and flooded him and kept him a slave. So being brave and being happy, evidently, is something that being drunk brings and also something that the spirit brings.

However, being filled with the spirit and being drunk are very unlike, of course, of course. And here's how. Paul seems to intuit what we know today empirically.

And that is that alcohol makes you brave and happy because it's a depressant. Did you know that? You can go look it up.

It's a chemical that actually is in the category of depressants. We say, well, if it's a depressant, how does it make you brave and happy? It depresses parts of the brain.

So it diminishes brain function. It diminishes brain ability so that a drunk person sees less of reality than you did before. And the things that we were afraid of and the things that were inhibiting you, they sort of melt away.

And then you're brave and happy. In other words, alcohol makes you brave and happy by depressing your brain and showing you less of reality. But the fullness of the spirit operates in exactly the opposite way.

Look at verse 15, 16 and 17. Looking up to Paul's command to be filled with the spirit, he is saying to the Ephesian Christians, he's saying, look at three things. He says, I want you to be wise.

Verse 15. Not foolish. He also says, I want you to be very careful in verse 15.

But that literally means I want you to be intensely aware. It's a word that means, literally it says, I want you to walk circumspecly. It means I want you to be utterly and intensely aware of things around you.

And then of course, it says, I want you to understand, understanding wisdom, intense awareness of what's going on, Paul is seeking a higher level of mental functioning. And where are we going to get that? Verse 18, be filled with the spirit.

Because the fullness of the spirit, unlike alcohol, doesn't make you brave and happy, doesn't make you joyful and courageous and joyful by showing you less of reality but by showing you more. And let me give you a perfect concrete illustration of that. Elisha, the great prophet, 2 Kings chapter 6.

He was in a city with his servant, he had a servant. And the city was surrounded by enemies, enemy troops that were, it was an overwhelming force that we're going to come upon the city tomorrow the next day. What Elisha was feeling okay?

Elisha had confidence, Elisha had courage, Elisha had joy, and the servant is just melting down with fear. And he says, how can you act like this, Elisha? Now Elisha could have done two things to help the servant face that night and the next day.

One is he could have given him a bottle of alcohol, and he could have said, hey, go get drunk. Because that would have shown him less of reality and it would have enabled him, perhaps, to face the future with a little more courage and a little more joy, but that's not what he did. Oh no, what did Elisha do?

He prayed to God and he said, oh Lord, open his eyes. Show him all of reality, not just the material but the spiritual, the supernatural, show him all of reality. And God opened his eyes, and in a very famous phrase, he saw chariots of fire on the mountains around the city.

In other words, he saw the hosts of God, he saw the angels, he saw the supernatural world. And he began to realize God is real and God is there and God is working a plan and God has his power, and that's the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is not giving you joy and courage by showing you less of reality but by showing you more of reality, showing what God and what he's doing and his plans and all that.

And therefore we're back to what we said at the very beginning of this series on the Holy Spirit. We were in the summer when we were looking at chapters in the book of John, 14, 15, 16, where Jesus says, when the Holy Spirit comes, he will glorify me. He will take what I'm telling you, what I've done.

He will take of mine and show it to you. The Holy Spirit's job is to take all the things that God is doing, all the things that God has done in Christ, all the things that Christ has done for you, all the things that you are in Christ. And it makes the Holy Spirit's job is to take all that and to communicate it to you, to make it so true to your mind, to the reason of your mind.

And so real to the deepest emotions of your heart, that who God is and what He has done and especially what He's done in Christ becomes the controlling power in your life. It dominates you. So the things that used to deflate you, don't deflate you, the things that used to inflate you, don't scare you anymore, because you see all of reality.

Alcohol is a depressant. It gets rid of negative thoughts. It gets rid of fears by depressing parts of your brain, showing you less of reality.

But here's what the fullness of the Spirit is. The fullness of the Spirit is not a frothy joy that helps you forget your troubles. No, in a very famous spot, C.

S. Lewis said, I didn't go to Christianity to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of port would do that.

If you want to make yourself happy and comfortable, I don't recommend Christianity. The fullness of the Spirit does not give you a frothy joy to make you forget your troubles, it gives you a heightened intense understanding of the truth and who God is and what He's doing in the world that enables you to triumph over your troubles. The fullness of the Spirit is a supernaturally charged cognition, which brings about a heart condition of courage and joy.

It's a heightened, intensified, existential moment-by-moment awareness of God in a salvation that dominates your life so that nothing else does. So that no fears do. No danger does.

Nothing does because you see all of reality. That's the fullness of the Spirit. Now, secondly, how do you know if you have the fullness of the Spirit?

What are the marks of a person who has it? Now, usually when people teach or preach on the being filled with the Spirit, they start with verse 18. I rather deliberately included verses 15, 16, 17, their run-up.

And the reason I did is because there you have Paul talking about wisdom and then saying, now, if you want wisdom, be filled with the Spirit. What I see in verses 15 all the way to 21 is the results of the fullness of the Spirit is a kind of almost what looks to us like a contradiction. There is a humble realism along with a surging joy, a humble realism along with a surging joy.

So for example, wisdom, what is that? Now, you know, that's a huge subject, but at least we know this from the Bible. To be wisdom means to be down to earth, to be wise means to be realistic, not idealistic, not naive, not having rosy colored glasses.

A wise person is savvy, a wise person knows how things work. A wise person knows what life is really like, reality, words and all. And look at the very end of the passage where it says, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

Submission means humble yourself before other people. Why? Out of reverence, out of this sense of awe and reverence, you have this humility before Christ.

See, being filled with the Spirit rightly is associated with joy, but we're also seeing that spiritual joy is accompanied by a humble realism. Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 6, we're sorrowful yet always rejoicing. We're sorrowful yet always rejoicing, we're poor yet we possess everything.

In other words, we're often sad but we're never really unhappy. What is he talking about? The fullness of the Spirit brings you a joy based on God.

It's a heightened understanding of God. It's a supernaturally charged cognition about God and His salvation. Whereas most of our, I don't know how to put it, the alternatives to being filled with the Spirit is getting high, getting high on a drug, getting high on alcohol, or even getting high on your own success.

When people say, I'm on a roll. I'm not thinking negative thoughts. I'm not thinking about my flaws.

I'm thinking about my strengths, positive thinking. Get rid of negative thoughts. That's not the fullness of the Spirit because the fullness of the Spirit enhances realism.

It enhances humility. The reason why you still have joy is because it's not looking at you and hey, you're on a roll. It's looking at God, which means that the joy of the Holy Spirit is like the stars because the stars get brighter and brighter as the night gets darker.

And the joy that comes from the fullness of the Spirit goes hand in hand with a wisdom and a realism and humility. And it can get actually stronger that joy can get stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

So first there's a humble realism but then on the other hand, yes, there is this surging joy. It's all here in 19 and 20. And since this is actually all one sentence in the Greek, what you see in verses 19, 20 and 21 flow out of the command to be filled with the spirit.

That's not as clear in the English because these are all broken into separate sentences. But you see, we're supposed to, let me work backwards. All a person filled with the spirit always gives thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Boy, now there we go. Now you begin to see how you could possibly have a joy that gets like the stars that gets brighter and stronger as the circumstances in your life get darker. Because here it says we must, a person filled with the spirit can always give thanks to God the Father for everything.

Now how is that possible? How is it possible to always have a grateful joy no matter how bad things are? And the answer is right at the very end in the name of Jesus.

See, in the name, the word in the Bible name means your character. And when the Holy Spirit is filling you, when the Holy Spirit is coming and glorifying Jesus and showing you what Jesus does, it drives you, the Holy Spirit, he drives you into the name of Jesus, who he is and what he's done. And here's one of the things you will see.

God hates evil. If God did not hate evil, he would not have sent his only son. There's no reason why he would ever send his only son to the world.

He hates the evil. He hates the disease. He hates the suffering and the death that's here.

He didn't make a world filled with these things. And yet how does God bring about our salvation? How does he give us life?

How does he bring us glory? By horrible things happening to Jesus Christ. God brings death out of life.

Part of me, he brings life out of death. He brings glory out of suffering. He brings salvation out of rejection.

All these awful things. It grieves God to see evil. And it has particularly grieved God to see evil fall in his only son.

And yet when the Holy Spirit, as the years go by, shows you more and more and more of the genius of the cross, of the genius of what God has done and the wisdom of what has God has done on the cross. And when you see how God brings more glory and more joy into the world because of the suffering of Jesus when suffering hits you, you're going to start to say, I don't know what you're doing, but I thank you. I know you're working.

And see, if you have that, if the Spirit has glorified Jesus to the place where you can thank God, always in everything, then you become a person who sings and makes music in your heart to the Lord. Actually, I love that verse. If you read right by that, and it looks a little bit fru-fru, doesn't it kind of sing and make melody in your heart, but however, notice it's not saying this is a person who's thinking about God, but who is communicating to God.

And I think this verse means this. The sing and make music in your heart to the Lord means. This is a person who so has a sense of God's presence and such a delight in God's actual presence.

That that person would put it into a song if he could. It's to live in the presence of God with such delight that you would sing about it if you could. You'd put it into a song if you possibly could.

Being filled with a Spirit means God is near. Being filled with a Spirit means you sense the nearness of God and you delight in the nearness of God and you would sing about it if you could, and sometimes we sing about even though we can't. It sounds horrible to everybody, probably even to God, but it doesn't matter.

And of course being filled with a Spirit means, therefore, that since we can thank God in all circumstances, and since we delight in His presence moment by moment, we become people who speak to one another with Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. I actually preached an entire sermon on that two years ago, and I can't recap it now, but that verse means not only that people fill with a Spirit, love music, and need to express their joy in God through music, but it also is talking about singing to one another, not just singing to God. And what that means is, Spirit filled people edify each other.

Spirit filled people are constantly talking about what God is doing in their lives to one another and helping us find God in new ways ourselves, because our friends around us are speaking to us about it. And the Spirit filled people create an incredible kind of Christian community. So here it is, humble realism, along with the searching joy.

Is your joy like that? Do you have a joy like that? It's like the stars.

I think it's brighter as the circumstances of your life get darker. Now if that's the fullness of the Spirit, I doubt that there's anybody here who doesn't fall into one of two categories. Either you're either going to say, I don't know anything of this at all, or you're going to say, I don't know nearly as much of it as I want.

So point three, how can we become filled with the Spirit? Oh my. Let me just let me take you to one place in the Bible that about 10 years ago hit me with all the force of a hammer.

We tend not to think about Jesus as being filled with the Spirit, perhaps. Yes, we always know about the baptism and the Spirit came down to annoy him for his ministry as baptism. But Jesus Christ spends most of his time weeping.

He's always a man of sorrows. He's weeping over Lazarus. He's weeping over Jerusalem.

He's a man of sorrows. But there is an amazing spot. It's related in Luke chapter 10 and also Matthew 11, where we're told Jesus exalted, exploded with joy in the Holy Spirit.

Jesus has an experience of the fullness of the Spirit. And this is what it says. This is Luke chapter 10.

He says, at that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Ghost, exalted and said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Listen to it again.

Jesus full of joy through the Holy Spirit exalted and said, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. Jesus has an explosion of joy.

Why? It's very interesting. He's full of the Holy Spirit and the joy of the Holy Spirit.

That's what Paul's talking about here. How did it happen? Here's how it happened.

He's noticing something. First of all, we learn here that if you find God, it's not because you reach him or you attain him, or you rise up toward him. Oh no, the only way anybody finds God is if God reveals himself, if God unveils himself to you.

But, who does he reveal himself to? He doesn't reveal himself to the learned. He doesn't reveal himself to the people who are wise in their own eyes.

He doesn't reveal himself to the accomplished, to the people who say, look at my accomplishments, look at my morality, look at my talent. He reveals himself to little children at a spiritual phrase, of course, in Jesus, the helpless, the weak, the people who know they've got nothing, the people who know they're spiritually bankrupt. So you know what Jesus is saying?

He's saying, I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace. And you don't divide the world into the good and the bad. You divide the world into the proud and the helpless.

I praise you, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth because you're a God of grace and you say by grace not by works. And Jesus looked at the gospel. He looked at grace and it filled him with the Holy Spirit.

Now look, Jesus is perfect. Jesus is right with God. Why would Jesus need the fullness of the Holy Spirit?

All I know is that even Jesus needed the fullness of the Holy Spirit to get through his life, to face the things he was facing. He literally had the whole way to the world put on him, but he was able to bear it because he had the fullness of the Spirit. Well, how did he get it?

He looked at grace. He looked at the gospel. Okay, look at this.

Let's do it right now. Psalm 51, David says to God, desperately, do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Oh, Lord, do not take your Holy Spirit from me.

Take not the Holy Spirit from me. Why? Why was he afraid?

Because he'd sinned and see Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God is holy. And the Spirit of God cannot dwell with sin. And David knew that.

And David knew that he was about to be abandoned. He deserved to be abandoned by the Spirit of God, with all of his joy, with all of his power. And that would have finished David as a king.

He just, take not the Holy Spirit from me. I deserve to have the Holy Spirit taken from me, but take not the Holy Spirit from me. And guess what?

God did not take the Holy Spirit from him. Holy Spirit stayed with him, even though he was a sinner, even though he deserved abandonment. So there's this sinful David, says, take not the Holy Spirit from me, and God didn't.

Centuries later, the ultimate David, the greater David, the descendant of David, the sinless Jesus Christ, the true king, says, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? You know what he's saying? He's saying, take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

Take not thy face from me. Take not thy presence from me. Don't take it away from me, but God did.

Why? You know, the sinful David deserved to lose the Holy Spirit. The sinless, ultimate greater David did not deserve to lose the Holy Spirit, but the sinful David kept the fullness of the Spirit and the sinless David, Jesus Christ lost the fullness of the Spirit.

Why? Because Jesus Christ was standing in our place and he was abandoned. He got the abandonment that David deserved, that you and I deserve.

Why? So he lost the fullness of the Spirit so you and I could have it even though we're sinners. Look at that.

Look at that and say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you've saved me by grace. Are you bored? Is there a deadness in your heart right now?

It's because you're forgetting grace. It's not real to your heart. Are you having trouble loving anybody?

Are you feeling really, are you looking down at people? Are you angry at people? It's because you've forgotten grace.

It hasn't melted and humbled your heart. Are you anxious? Are you afraid God's going to let you down?

It's because you've forgotten grace. You've forgotten the fact that God was not going to abandon you. Look at what he's done for you on the cross.

Look at grace, grace, grace until there's an explosion of joy to joy of the Holy Spirit. Do you want to be filled with the Spirit? First, you have to be filled with Christ.

You have to become a little child. You have to rely on him alone for salvation. You have to stop saying, oh, Lord, please receive me because what I've done or who I am.

You've got to say, oh, Lord, please receive me just by grace because of what Jesus has done. So in order to be filled with the Spirit, first, you have to be filled with Christ. But then, you've got to take time.

You've got to take time morning and evening and maybe in the middle of the day. You've got to set aside time for you to look at the truth of the Bible. The truth of God in general and the truth of the gospel in particular.

And study it and know it and meditate on it and ask the Spirit to ignite it in you. There's no, listen, it's not like, oh, you have your doctrine in all your truth, but I'm interested in mystical experience. No, the Holy Spirit, the experience, the spirit is the truth on fire in your life.

It's theology on fire in your life. And that takes study and that takes prayer and that takes the means of grace and that takes the spiritual disciplines of prayer and of worship, of study and of group prayer and of individual prayer and of corporate prayer. I can't just drop in on church a couple of times a month and hope for some inspiration and expect the fullness of the Spirit.

Look at what Jesus Christ has done systematically, thematically in a disciplined way until you can say, I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth that you are God of grace and you've been a God of grace to me. Let's pray, our Father, we are so grateful that you're a God of grace and you don't divide the world into the good and the bad but you divide the world into the proud and the helpless. The people who don't think they need grace and the people who do know that they need grace.

And we thank you that you have been willing to come into our lives, but we also know that we don't experience this humble realism in searching joy, this heightened supernaturally charged cognition. We have not made ourselves available to it and we ask that your Holy Spirit would fill us. Fill us.

And that we go on being filled with your Spirit so that we also can become a congregation of people who sing to one another and speak to one another and build each other up in love. So, Father, help us to apply all these things through the inspiration of your Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus we ask it. Amen.

现在，请听戴德·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。首先有一种谦卑的现实感，但另一方面，确实有这种涌动的喜乐。这一切都在19和20节中体现出来。由于这实际上是希腊文中的一个句子，所以你可以在第19、20和21节看到这些内容都是从“被圣灵充满”的命令流出来的。

在英文中可能不太明显，因为这些都被分成了单独的句子。但你看，我们应当这样理解：所有被圣灵充满的人总是要感谢神的父，在耶稣基督的名里，对一切感恩。现在你开始明白，为什么在生活中的情况变得越来越糟糕时，仍然能够拥有如星星般越来越亮、越来越强的喜乐。因为这里说，一个被圣灵充满的人可以对一切向神的父感恩。

那么这怎么可能呢？无论事情多么糟糕，如何总是保持感激和喜乐？答案就在“耶稣基督”的名里。看，“名”这个词在圣经中是指人的品格。

当圣灵充满你时，当圣灵来荣耀耶稣，并显明耶稣所做的事时，祂会驱使你进入耶稣的名，进入祂是谁以及祂所做的一切。这里有一个重要的观点： 神憎恶邪恶。如果神不憎恶邪恶，祂就不会差遣独生子来到这个世界。神没有理由要差遣独生子来拯救世界。

神憎恶邪恶，憎恶疾病、痛苦和死亡。祂并没有创造一个充满这些事物的世界。然而，神是如何带来我们的救赎？如何赐给我们生命呢？

他如何为我们带来荣耀？通过耶稣基督所经历的可怕之事。神从死亡中带来了生命。我内心的一部分，他是从死亡中带来了生命，从苦难中带来了荣耀，从拒绝中带来了救赎。

这一切可怕的事件。神看到邪恶会感到哀伤。特别是当神看到邪恶降临在他唯一的儿子身上时，他更是心痛不已。然而，随着时间的流逝，圣灵逐渐向你揭示十字架的智慧和神在其中所展现的奇妙计划与智慧。

当你看到耶稣受苦如何为世界带来更多的荣耀和喜乐时，即使苦难临到你，你也可能会开始说：“我不知道你在做什么，但我感谢你。我知道你在做工。” 你看，如果你有这样的认识，圣灵已经将耶稣荣耀到一个地步，使你能无论在任何情况下都向神感恩，那么你就成了一个内心欢唱、用心灵歌唱赞美主的人。其实，我喜欢这一节经文。

当你读到紧接的下一句时，是不是感觉就像是在心中吟唱和弹奏旋律一样？不过请注意，它并不是说这是个思考神的人，而是指与神交流的人。我认为这节经文的意思是这样的：“用心灵歌唱赞美主”意味着这个人对神的同在有深切的感受，并且对神的实际同在感到极大的喜悦。他甚至会将这种感受化作歌声，如果能的话。

这就是一个活在神同在中的喜乐中，以至于想唱出来的人。被圣灵充满的意思是神就在你身边。被圣灵充满意味着你能感受到神的临近，并因神的临近而欢喜，甚至会想把它唱出来。有时我们即使唱得很难听，甚至可能连神都觉得不好听，但这都不重要。

当然，被圣灵充满意味着我们无论在任何情况下都能感谢上帝，在每一个时刻都享受祂的同在。因此，我们会用诗歌、颂词和属灵的歌彼此交谈。两年前我曾专门讲过这个主题，现在无法再复述了，但这段经文不仅说明了被圣灵充满的人会热爱音乐，并通过音乐表达对上帝的喜乐，还告诉我们应该彼此歌唱，而不仅仅是向神歌唱。**这意味着，圣灵充满的人彼此造就。**

圣灵充满的人不断谈论神在他们生命中所做的事情，并帮助我们以新的方式寻找神。因为我们的朋友会用言语向我们讲述这些事情。所以，圣灵充满的人创造了一种令人难以置信的基督教社区。这就是谦卑而真实的现实，伴随着探索性的喜乐。

你的喜乐是否如此？你是否有这样的喜乐？就像星星一样璀璨夺目。我认为，当生活中的情况变得越黑暗时，这种喜乐就越明亮。

如果这是圣灵充满的状态，那么我不怀疑在座的没有人会不属于以下两种类别之一：要么完全不了解这种状态；要么知道得不够多。第三点，我们如何被圣灵充满呢？哦，天哪。让我带你去圣经的一个地方，大约十年前，这段经文给我带来了如同锤击般的震撼。

我们通常不会想到耶稣是被圣灵充满的。当然，我们知道祂在受洗时被圣灵降下，为祂的使命作见证。但耶稣大部分时间都在哭泣，是一个满有哀伤的人。祂为拉撒路哭泣，也为耶路撒冷哭泣。

然而，在路加福音第10章和马太福音第11章中，有一个令人惊讶的地方，告诉我们耶稣在圣灵里被高举、充满喜乐。耶稣经历到了圣灵的完全充满。这段经文是这样的：路加福音第10章。他这样说：那时，耶稣被圣灵充满，高声说：“我要赞美你，父，天地的主；因为你隐藏这些事，在创造万物之前，已经向智慧和学问的精英隐藏了。

然而，你将这些事显明给小孩子。是的，父啊，这是你的美意。” 为什么呢？这非常有趣。

耶稣被圣灵充满，心中充满了圣灵的喜乐。保罗在这里讲的是什么？是怎么回事呢？让我们看看他是怎么解释的。

他注意到一些事情。首先，我们从这里学到的一点是：如果你找到了上帝，并不是因为你达到了他、获得了他，或者你向他上升了。不，找到上帝的唯一方式就是如果上帝向你显明自己，向你揭开自己的面纱。但是，他会向谁显明自己呢？

他不会向那些自以为聪明的人显明自己，也不会向那些自认为有成就的人显明自己。他不会向那些夸耀自己成就、道德和才能的人显明自己。他会向小孩子，在灵性上，当然就是向无助的、软弱的人显明自己，向知道自己一无所有、灵性破产的人显明自己。那么，耶稣在这里说什么呢？

他说：“我要赞美你，父，天地的主，因为你是一个怜悯的上帝。你不把世界分成好人和坏人，而是分成骄傲和无助的人。” 我要赞美你，父，天地的主，因为你是一个怜悯的上帝，并且你说的是恩典而不是行为。耶稣看着福音，看着恩典，心中充满了圣灵。

现在，注意一下：耶稣是完美的，他与神同在。为什么耶稣还需要圣灵的完全充满呢？所有我所知道的是，即使耶稣也需要圣灵的全备来度过他的一生，面对那些他必须面对的事情。他实际上把整个世界的重担都扛在了自己身上，但他能够承受这一切，是因为他有圣灵的全备。

那么他是怎么得到的呢？他看到了恩典，看到了福音。好吧，让我们现在来看一下。让我们立刻去做这件事。

诗篇51章，大卫向神哀求说：“不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。”哦，主啊，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。“不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。”为什么？

为什么他会害怕？因为他犯了罪，而圣灵，神的灵是圣洁的。神的灵不能与罪同住。大卫知道这一点。

大卫也知道他即将被遗弃。他配得上被神的灵遗弃，连同他的喜乐和能力。这将使大卫作为国王的身份完蛋。所以他只是说，“不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。

”他配得上失去圣灵，但不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。猜猜看？神并没有离弃他。圣灵仍然与他同在，即使他是罪人，即使他配得上被遗弃。

所以这个有罪的大卫说，“不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回”，而神没有这样做。几个世纪后，最终的大卫、更伟大的大卫、大卫的后代、无罪的耶稣基督、**真正的王说：“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？”你知道他在说什么吗？他是**在说，“不要离弃我，不要将你的圣灵从我身上收回。

” “不要离弃我，不要将你的面从我身上收回。”“不要离弃我的同在。”但神却这样做了。为什么？

你知道的，有罪的大卫配得上失去圣灵。无罪、更伟大的大卫不配失去圣灵，但有罪的大卫保留了圣灵的全备，而无罪的耶稣基督失去了圣灵的全备。为什么？因为耶稣基督站在我们的位置上，并且他被遗弃了。

他承受了大卫和我们所应得的遗弃。为什么？所以他失去了圣灵的全备，好让我们这些罪人可以拥有它。看看这个。

看看这个，然后说：“我要赞美你，天父，天地的主，因为你用恩典救了我。”你现在厌烦了吗？现在你的心里有没有一种麻木感？这是因为你忘记了恩典。

它对你的心来说并不真实。你现在有没有爱任何人有困难？你现在是不是看不起人？是不是对人感到愤怒？

这是因为你忘记了恩典。它还没有融化并使你的内心谦卑。你现在焦虑吗？你现在害怕上帝会让你失望吗？

这是因为你忘记了恩典，忘记了神不会丢弃你。看看他在十字架上为你所做的一切。继续赞美恩典，直到圣灵的喜乐在你心中爆发。你想被圣灵充满吗？

首先，你需要被基督充满。你需要成为一个小孩子，独自依靠他得救。你需要停止说：“哦，主，请接纳我，因为我做了什么或我是谁。” 你应该说：“哦，主，请接纳我只是因为耶稣所做的一切。

”所以，为了被圣灵充满，你首先要被基督充满。但是，你还必须花时间。你需要在早晨、晚上甚至一天中的某个时刻安排时间。你需要为自己留出时间来阅读圣经的真理，特别是神的一般真理和福音的具体真理。

研究它，了解它，并默想它，请圣灵点燃你的心。听我说，这并不是说你有你的教义和全部真理，但我对神秘体验感兴趣。不，圣灵的经历、圣灵就是你生命中的真理在燃烧。这就是你生命中神学的燃烧。

这需要学习，需要祷告，需要恩典的手段，还需要祈祷和敬拜的精神纪律，包括个人祈祷和集体祈祷。我不能每个月只来教会几次希望得到一些灵感，并期望圣灵的丰满。审视耶稣基督有条不紊、按主题系统地所做的事，直到你能说：“我要赞美你，天父，宇宙的主宰，你是恩典之神，你以恩典待我。”让我们祷告：我们的父亲，我们如此感恩，因为你是一位恩典之神，并不是将世界分为善与恶，而是分为骄傲和无助。

那些不觉得自己需要恩典的人和那些知道自己需要恩典的人。感谢你愿意进入我们的生活，但我们也知道，我们并没有体验到这种谦卑的现实，在寻找喜乐中的认识，超自然的力量带来的洞察力。我们没有让自己变得足够开放，所以我们恳求你的圣灵充满我们。充满我们。

让我们继续被你的圣灵充满，这样我们也能成为一个彼此歌唱、交谈、在爱中互相建造的教会。父啊，请帮助我们在你圣灵的启发下应用这一切。奉耶稣的名，我们祈求。阿门。
