## 引言与经文阅读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love?

People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching unsin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us.

Then, Joshua said to Aiken, my son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and give him the praise, tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me. Aiken replied, it's true, I've sinned against the Lord the God of Israel. This is what I have done.

When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath. So Joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and there it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.

They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the Lord. Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Aiken son of Zira, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, cadunkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had to the valley of a core. And Joshua said, why have you brought this trouble on us?

The Lord will bring trouble on you today. And they all Israel stone him and after they stone the rest, they burn them. And this is the Lord speaking, talking about Israel.

I will punish her for the day she burned incense to the veils. She decked herself with rings and jewelry and went after her lovers. But may she forgot to clear the Lord.

Therefore, I am now going to allure her. I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her. Therefore I will give her back her vineyards and I will make the valley of a core, a door of hope.

There she will sing as in the days of her youth, as in the days she came up from Egypt. And this is God's word.

欢迎来到"生命中的福音"。为什么这个世界如此破碎？为什么我们能够对那些我们所爱的人造成如此巨大的伤害？

人们把原因归咎于政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都不能完全解释我们在自己和历史中所看到的一切。本月在播客中，提摩太·凯勒将教导一个系列，探讨这个问题：我们到底出了什么问题？认识圣经关于罪的教导如何提供了唯一足够深刻的解释来面对其全部复杂性的真相，以及唯一足够有力的盼望来改变我们。

然后，约书亚对亚干说："我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，在他面前认罪，将你所做的事告诉我，不要向我隐瞒。"亚干回答说："我实在得罪了耶和华以色列的神。我所做的事如此：

我在所夺的财物中看见一件美好的巴比伦衣服、二百舍客勒银子、一条金子重五十舍客勒，我就贪爱这些物件，便拿去了。现今藏在我帐棚内的地里，银子在衣服底下。"于是约书亚打发人跑到亚干的帐棚里，那件衣服果然藏在他帐棚内，银子在底下。

他们就从帐棚里取出来，拿到约书亚和以色列众人那里，放在耶和华面前。约书亚和以色列众人把谢拉的曾孙亚干和那银子、那件衣服、那条金子，并亚干的儿女、牛、驴、羊、帐棚，以及他所有的，都带到亚割谷去。约书亚说："你为什么连累我们呢？今日耶和华必叫你受连累。"

于是以色列众人用石头打死他，将石头扔在其上，又用火焚烧他所有的。这是主在说话，谈论以色列：

"我必追讨她素日给诸巴力烧香的罪，那时她佩带耳环和别样妆饰，随从她所爱的，却忘记我。这是耶和华说的。

因此，我必诱导她，领她到旷野，对她说安慰的话。我必从那里赐她葡萄园，又赐她亚割谷作为指望的门。她必在那里应声，与幼年的日子一样，与从埃及地上来的时候相同。"这是神的话语。

## 贪食与欲望的紊乱 / Gluttony and the Disorder of Desire

You know, the seven deadly sins were cataloged by, especially Thomas Aquinas who was a medieval theologian.

And one of the seven deadly sins that he cataloged was the sin of gluttony. Now gluttony in his technical sense, the technical meaning of the word gluttony is to eat and drink immoderately. When food and drink becomes too important to you and you use it immoderately.

And the moral theologians of the Middle Ages discerned several forms of gluttony. They said that you can eat and drink excessively, you can eat and drink sumptuously, daintily or impulsively. And those are different kinds of gluttony.

So first of all, you have excessively, that means demanding too much food. And you can also eat sumptuously which is demanding only the richest food. And you can eat daintily which meant to demand only the most perfectly prepared food just so.

And you can eat impulsively which is to demand food now, right now. And you know, it's hard in New York City to avoid the sin of gluttony. There's no other place where you don't just have food at every corner.

You have food at your, and you can smell it, of course, right at your elbow, everywhere you move. And of course, especially the category of daintiness, the gluttony of the dainty category, very hard because if you've lived in New York for a while and you go visit from friends somewhere else in the country, you know, it starts a dawn on you that the best restaurant in Cleveland is only as good as your corner deli here. And you start to say, oh yeah, it's all right, you know, and you start to become daintie.

Now we laugh. In fact, we might laugh very patronizingly at the entire category of gluttony, but we stop laughing when we reflect on two things when we think of two things. Number one, the medieval moral theologians were onto alcoholism and eating disorders well before modern psychology.

They understood there's something wrong here, but let me go a little further. You know, every week you go over one of the seven deadly sins and there's a sense in which each sin on the surface behaviorally is different. And so you can go through the seven deadly sins in a series of sermons like we're doing or in a series of chapters and you will feel that some of them nail you more than others because some of them are more your problem than others and that of course makes sense.

And yet in another sense, if you look beneath, if you look at the hard attitudes, the seven deadly sins are really like holding up a black diamond. And as you turn the black diamond, you know, you see a different facet, but every facet is just another way of looking down into the same heart of darkness. And so every single sin shows us something about how sin infects and affects all of us.

And this is what gluttony says to us. gluttony tells us something about all of us. gluttony is taking something good, something necessary and cramming it in until we're sick of it until we're ready to explode.

gluttony is a way for us to see that sin has affected our heart so that our desires are disordered. Our desires are disordered in such a way that good and necessary things become cravings, become yearnings. Saint Augustine gave it a word.

He said, we're all characterized. Sin has done this to us. We're all characterized by what he called concupacence, but a great word.

You know, from the Latin Cupera, which means desire, in fact, we have the word cupid, the god cupid, which had to do with the god of one particular kind of desire, but concupacence meant there's an infection, there's a disorder. Our desires have been disordered in such a way that good and necessary things now drive us and we crave them. We did another way.

The opposite of gluttony is self-control. And since all of us have self-control somewhere, since all of us have self-control problems somewhere, we all have a place in which our desires are disordered. Sin in other words, makes us all addicted to something.

The spectacular addictions, like alcoholism, like home spectacular, they're obvious, they are just a template for understanding how all of our hearts work in some way. And that is what this teaches us about. We are all in the grip of craving.

We all crave something and we do it in such a way as I'm going to show you that it is very, very bad for us. Now, let's just take a look and see what this teaches us, about three kinds of craving. You know, our hearts are filled with such demandingness and craving at some point.

That's sin that does it. And the three things we see, let's learn these three things. The depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing.

We learn the depth of our craving, the structure of our craving, and the healing of our craving.

你知道，七宗罪是由中世纪神学家，特别是托马斯·阿奎那编录的。

他编录的七宗罪之一就是贪食之罪。现在，贪食在技术意义上，这个词的技术含义是指过度饮食。当食物和饮料对你来说变得过于重要，你就会过度地使用它。

中世纪的道德神学家们辨识出了贪食的几种形式。他们说你可以过度地吃喝，你可以奢华地吃喝，精致地或冲动地吃喝。这些都是不同种类的贪食。

所以首先，你可以过度吃喝，这意味着要求太多的食物。你也可以奢华地吃喝，这是只要求最丰盛的食物。你可以精致地吃喝，这意味着只要求准备得恰到好处的最完美的食物。

你可以冲动地吃喝，这是要求现在就要食物，立刻就要。你知道，在纽约市很难避免贪食之罪。没有其他地方像这里一样，不仅每个街角都有食物。

你的身边就有食物，当然，你可以闻到它，在你的手肘旁，无论你走到哪里。当然，特别是精致这一类，精致类别的贪食，非常困难，因为如果你在纽约住了一段时间，然后去拜访美国其他地方的朋友，你知道，你会开始意识到克利夫兰最好的餐厅也只相当于你这里街角的熟食店。你会开始说，哦是的，还行吧，你知道，然后你就开始变得精致了。

现在我们笑了。事实上，我们可能会非常居高临下地嘲笑整个贪食这一类别，但当我们思考两件事的时候，我们就笑不出来了。第一，中世纪的道德神学家们在现代心理学之前就已经洞察到了酗酒和饮食失调的问题。

他们理解这里出了问题，但让我再进一步说。你知道，每周你会查看七宗罪中的一项，从某种意义上说，表面行为上每一种罪都是不同的。所以你可以在一系列讲道中查看七宗罪，就像我们现在做的，或者在一系列章节中，你会觉得其中一些比其他的更能击中你，因为其中一些比其他的更是你的问题，这当然是有道理的。

然而从另一个意义上说，如果你往深处看，如果你看那些核心态度，七宗罪真的就像拿着一颗黑钻石。当你转动黑钻石时，你知道，你看到不同的切面，但每个切面只是观察同一个黑暗之心的另一种方式。所以每一种罪都向我们展示了罪如何感染和影响我们所有人。

这就是贪食告诉我们的。贪食告诉我们关于我们所有人的一些事情。贪食是拿一样好东西，一样必需品，然后往里塞，直到我们厌恶它，直到我们准备爆炸。

贪食是让我们看到罪已经影响了我们的心，以至于我们的欲望是紊乱的。我们的欲望紊乱到这样的程度，以至于好的和必需的东西变成了渴求，变成了渴望。圣奥古斯丁给了它一个词。

他说，我们所有人都有这个特征。罪对我们做了这个。我们所有人都有他所说的"情欲"这个特征，这是个很好的词。

你知道，从拉丁语Cupera来的，意思是欲望，事实上，我们有丘比特这个词，爱神丘比特，与一种特定的欲望有关，但情欲意味着有一种感染，有一种紊乱。我们的欲望已经紊乱到这样的程度，以至于好的和必需的东西现在驱使我们，我们渴求它们。换一种说法。

贪食的反面是自制。既然我们所有人在某个地方都有自制力，既然我们所有人在某个地方都有自制问题，我们都有一个地方我们的欲望是紊乱的。换句话说，罪使我们所有人都对某些东西上瘾。

像酗酒这样壮观的成瘾，是多么壮观，它们是显而易见的，它们只是一个模板，让我们理解我们所有人的心在某种程度上是如何运作的。这就是这个教导我们的。我们都在渴求的掌控之中。

我们都渴求某些东西，我们这样做的方式正如我将要向你展示的，对我们来说是非常、非常糟糕的。现在，让我们看一看，看这个教导我们关于三种渴求的什么。你知道，我们的心在某个时候充满了这样的苛求和渴求。

那是罪造成的。我们看到的三件事，让我们学习这三件事。我们渴求的深度，我们渴求的结构，以及医治。

我们学习我们渴求的深度，我们渴求的结构，以及我们渴求的医治。

## 渴求的深度：亚干自杀性的欲望 / The Depth of Our Craving: Achan's Suicidal Desire

First of all, let's look at the depth of the craving. When Joshua comes to Akin, it says, my son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and give him the praise.

Tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me. And Akin says, it's true.

There's a remarkable thing going on here. And I know when I first read it and you see Akin and all of his cattle and all of his family being stoned and burned and there was a kind of, this is Manhattan, you know, this is one of those places in the Bible where things happen that we all know now. We're wrong and terrible.

Well, listen, Akin knew exactly what he'd done. You don't see Akin saying, oh my gosh, you mean this is a capital offense? You mean you're going to do this?

You're going to do what? Oh, no. He says, you got me.

Listen, when God took the children of Israel out of Egypt and moved them to Canaan, to their promised land, as they took that land through conquest, he lay down a rule. And that rule went like this. He says, you are not just any old bloodthirsty pirate nation.

This is the way other nations are. You will not be this way. You are not coming into Canaan to satisfy the desire for the increase of national power.

And secondly, you're not coming into Canaan to satisfy your own personal desire to increase your private wealth. Oh, no. You're not pirates.

You're not here to plunder. You are coming to the land that I promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob. It's yours and there I'm going to dwell with you.

So whenever you come and you take a city, all of the money, all of the wealth of that city, you must never take it as booty. You must never see it as plunder. That goes to building a tabernacle and later on a temple, which will be a house of worship for the all of the people and in which I will dwell in your midst.

And therefore no one has ever conquered like that. There's never been a country like that. There's never been a nation that conquered like that.

He says, you're not doing it out of an imperialistic desire for expansion. You're not doing it out of a desire to just materially increase yourself. Oh, no.

And as a result, he lay down this. You never take the possessions of the conquered people, never. And you see, that was critical to the very identity as a people.

That was critical to the legitimacy of the whole campaign and it was absolutely critical to the honor of God. And the rule was laid down and everybody knew it was a capital offense. I'll be with you as long as you don't do that.

And as long as they didn't do that, he was with them and they had success in their campaign. Everybody knew about that rule. Everybody knew why it was so serious.

Everybody knew that it was at the heart of the honor of God. God did not just say, oh, look it, you're my people. So I just want you to go and plunder and slaughter everybody else.

This was absolutely critical to their self-understanding, critical to the morality and the legitimacy of the campaign, critical to the glory of God. So when Agen saw what he saw, we're going to see in a minute. His heart so coveted those things that he took him anyway.

He knew what he was doing. He knew how bad it was. He knew how serious the consequences were going to be one way or the other.

And when he was caught, he said, yeah, yeah, I did it. He didn't say, what? What?

You're going to what? Oh no. He knew.

And what is the point? I'll tell you what the point is. Our craving, our hearts desire for things, is so strong that it overcomes our conscience, that it overcomes our understanding, our reason, eventually it will overcome your fear of consequences and even your own sense of self-preservation.

Sin so affects you that there are some things that you must have and that you will crave and you will crave them so much that you will take them even to the degree that to get them is to lose everything Agen did. That's what craving is. The heart makes you want some things so much.

It's suicidal to get them. To even get them always ends up meaning you lose everything, but you have to get it anyway. That's how bad it is.

The sin affects our hearts in such a way that the most basic part of our heart is not our reason. It's not our conscience. It's not our even our instinct for self-preservation.

We'll get what things we want, whether or not it means we lose everything in the end. You know, in CS Lewis's first fairy tale of the Chronicles of Narnia, in that story, the witch gives Edmund some Turkish delight and it's enchanted and this is what he says about it. Anyone who had ever once tasted this Turkish delight would want more and more and would even, if allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves.

That's a picture of the way the human heart latches on to things. We all latch on to something like that. Remember, some of you were here last week, I'm sure, in Numbers chapter 11, we're told that the children of Israel had been going through the wilderness and God had been given the manna to eat a bread stuff, but they wanted meat.

Well, it's okay to want meat, but they felt the old King James says they fell a lusting for meat. And God says, I'll give you meat, but because you're craving it, and if you go back to the chapter we looked at last week and you go down to verse 20 and 21, there's an amazing statement where God says, I'll give you meat and you will eat it and you will eat it until it comes out of your nostrils and you come to loathe it. The nature of this craving that our hearts have, sin makes us desire some things to the place where we want it beyond what's good for us.

We want it beyond reason, beyond conscience. We do it no matter what. A hypochondriac, let me give you an easy example, and I'll show you some of them.

A hypochondriac is somebody who wants health so much and so afraid of losing it that they lose it. They don't go outside. They're afraid of being infected as a result.

What's the best way to stay healthy? Sunshine, fresh air, but in these days and he's so afraid of losing it that he loses it. When I was in high school in college, I really wanted to be good at playing the trumpet.

I was fairly good at playing the trumpet, but I wanted so desperately to be good that whenever I went to an audition in high school in college, I finally gave up on music partly because of this. Whenever I would go to an audition, I would be absolutely petrified. I could not hardly keep the mouthpiece on my lips.

I'd be trembling. Sometimes I'd be crying during the audition because I was that scared. I was so afraid of losing it that I always lost it.

Over the years, I don't know how many times I've counseled spouses who are so afraid of losing their spouse, that they lost their spouse. They were so jealous, so they were so dependent. You can go on and on.

Who are the kids? I mean, see, I'm going from the very serious to the sublime, but you see, this is the way craving works. Who are the kids who never had any friends in school?

Remember who they were? They were the kids that wanted the friends so badly. They'd come after you like a puppy.

If you even showed them some interest, they would say, oh, good, you want to be my friend. Get away from me, you would think, you know? It's the people who most wanted friends who never had friends.

They were so afraid. They wanted them so badly, they never got it. They were so afraid of losing it, they were always losing them.

首先，让我们看渴求的深度。当约书亚来到亚干面前，经文说："我儿，我劝你将荣耀归给耶和华以色列的神，在他面前认罪。

告诉我你所做的事。不要向我隐瞒。"亚干说："是真的。"

这里发生了一件非凡的事。我知道当我第一次读到它时，你看到亚干和他所有的牛和他所有的家人被石头打死并焚烧，这是某种，这是曼哈顿，你知道，这是圣经中那些我们现在都知道的事情发生的地方之一。我们错了，很可怕。

好吧，听着，亚干确切地知道他做了什么。你没有看到亚干说，哦我的天哪，你是说这是死罪吗？你是说你要这样做吗？

你要做什么？哦，不。他说，你抓到我了。

听着，当神把以色列人从埃及领出来，把他们带到迦南，到他们的应许之地时，当他们通过征服夺取那地时，他定下了一条规则。那条规则是这样的。他说，你们不是任何一个嗜血的海盗国家。

其他国家是这样的。你们不会是这样。你们不是来到迦南满足对国家权力增长的欲望。

其次，你们不是来到迦南满足你们个人增加私人财富的欲望。哦，不。你们不是海盗。

你们不是来掠夺的。你们来到我应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的地。那是你们的，我要在那里与你们同住。

所以每当你们来夺取一座城时，那座城的所有钱财，所有财富，你们绝不可拿它作为战利品。你们绝不可把它看作掠夺物。那要用来建造会幕，后来建造圣殿，那将是所有人的敬拜之所，我将住在你们中间。

因此从来没有人这样征服过。从来没有这样的国家。从来没有一个国家这样征服。

他说，你们不是出于帝国主义扩张的欲望这样做的。你们不是出于仅仅物质上增加自己的欲望这样做的。哦，不。

因此，他定下这个规则。你们绝不可拿被征服者的财物，绝不可。你看，这对他们作为一个民族的身份至关重要。

这对整个战役的合法性至关重要，这对神的荣耀绝对至关重要。这条规则被定下来，每个人都知道这是死罪。只要你们不这样做，我就与你们同在。

只要他们不这样做，他就与他们同在，他们的战役就成功。每个人都知道那条规则。每个人都知道为什么它如此严重。

每个人都知道它是神的荣耀的核心。神不只是说，哦，看，你们是我的子民。所以我只是想让你们去掠夺和屠杀所有其他人。

这对他们的自我理解绝对至关重要，对战役的道德和合法性至关重要，对神的荣耀至关重要。所以当亚干看到他所看到的，我们马上就会看到。他的心如此贪恋那些东西，以至于他无论如何都拿了它们。

他知道他在做什么。他知道这有多糟糕。他知道后果将会有多严重，无论如何。

当他被抓住时，他说，是的，是的，我做了。他没有说，什么？什么？

你要怎样？哦不。他知道。

重点是什么？我告诉你重点是什么。我们的渴求，我们的心对事物的欲望，是如此强烈，以至于它克服了我们的良心，克服了我们的理解，我们的理性，最终它会克服你对后果的恐惧，甚至你自己的自我保护意识。

罪如此影响你，以至于有些东西你必须拥有，你会渴求它们，你会如此渴求它们，以至于你会拿走它们，即使得到它们意味着失去一切，亚干就是这样做的。这就是渴求。心使你想要某些东西如此之多。

得到它们是自杀性的。甚至得到它们总是意味着你失去一切，但你无论如何都要得到它。就是这么糟糕。

罪以这样的方式影响我们的心，以至于我们心中最基本的部分不是我们的理性。不是我们的良心。甚至不是我们的自我保护本能。

我们会得到我们想要的东西，无论这是否意味着我们最终失去一切。你知道，在C·S·路易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》第一个童话故事中，在那个故事里，女巫给埃德蒙一些土耳其软糖，它被施了魔法，这是他对它的描述。任何曾经尝过这种土耳其软糖的人都会想要越来越多，甚至，如果允许的话，会一直吃，直到他们杀死自己。

这是人类的心如何紧紧抓住事物的写照。我们都这样紧紧抓住某些东西。记得吗，你们有些人上周在这里，我确定，在民数记第十一章，我们被告知以色列人一直在旷野中行走，神一直给他们吗哪吃，一种面包状的东西，但他们想要肉。

嗯，想要肉是可以的，但他们感觉到，老钦定版说他们起了淫欲要吃肉。神说，我会给你们肉，但因为你们渴求它，如果你回到我们上周看的那一章，你往下看第20节和21节，有一个惊人的声明，神说，我会给你们肉，你们会吃它，你们会吃它，直到它从你们的鼻孔里出来，你们会厌恶它。我们的心所拥有的这种渴求的本质，罪使我们渴望某些东西到这样的地步，我们想要它超过了对我们有益的程度。

我们想要它超过了理性，超过了良心。我们无论如何都要这样做。一个疑病症患者，让我给你一个简单的例子，我会向你展示其中一些。

疑病症患者是那些如此想要健康，如此害怕失去它的人，以至于他们失去了它。他们不出门。他们害怕被感染，结果。

保持健康的最好方法是什么？阳光，新鲜空气，但在这些日子里，他如此害怕失去它，以至于他失去了它。当我在高中和大学时，我真的想要擅长吹小号。

我相当擅长吹小号，但我如此拼命地想要擅长，以至于每当我在高中大学参加试奏时，我最终放弃了音乐，部分原因就是这个。每当我要去试奏时，我会绝对吓坏了。我几乎无法把吹嘴放在嘴唇上。

我会颤抖。有时我会在试奏期间哭泣，因为我那么害怕。我如此害怕失去它，以至于我总是失去它。

这些年来，我不知道我辅导了多少次那些如此害怕失去配偶的配偶，以至于他们失去了配偶。他们如此嫉妒，如此依赖。你可以继续说下去。

孩子们呢？我的意思是，看，我从非常严重的到崇高的，但你看，这就是渴求的运作方式。在学校里从来没有朋友的孩子是谁？

记得他们是谁吗？他们是那些如此渴望朋友的孩子。他们会像小狗一样追着你。

如果你对他们表现出一些兴趣，他们会说，哦，好，你想成为我的朋友。离我远点，你会想，你知道吗？最想要朋友的人从来没有朋友。

他们如此害怕。他们如此想要朋友，他们从来没有得到。他们如此害怕失去朋友，他们总是失去朋友。

## 绝望背后隐藏的渴求 / Hidden Cravings Beneath Our Despair

There are things that we crave, and because we crave them, we crave them out of proportion. It hurts us now. One of the things that's a little hard to talk about here is to point out that it's easier when you're kind of craving or addicted to very concrete things.

There's people here, for example, this is New York, so I'm sure there's people here who are addicted to nice concrete things like there's various sorts of sexual addictions, liaisons or pornography or something like that. There's gambling, there's drink, there's eating disorders, and in some ways, you know, hypochondra I mentioned that in some ways, those are a little easier to at least deal with. You know they're there, they're concrete, they're visible, they're physical in many cases.

But what about the rest of us? Will you listen? Most of the time when you're the most depressed, most of the time when you're the most discouraged, most of the time when you're the most in the fit of rage, look at yourself.

And here's what you're going to find. The reason you're so discouraged, the reason you're in such despair, the reason you're so petrified, the reason that you're in such a grip is because there's something in your life, and very often it's not all that physical, not all that tangible. There's something in your life that you want immoderately.

If you could be moderate about it, if you could say, she I'd like to have that, she would be a great thing, but you know, it's not that critical. If you could say that about it, you wouldn't be in despair, you might be disappointed. You wouldn't be in bitterness, you might just be irritated, you know.

You wouldn't be petrified, you'd be worried. But it's because it's not immoderate, because you've got to have, because it's the craving at the bottom of almost all of our discouragements, at the bottom of almost all of our deepest difficulties is this. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, What Is Wrong With The World, Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

This newly released book What Is Wrong With The World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus. This is your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. And see what's hard is, what happens when you're really addicted to a certainty? And that's the reason why you can never make a decision, and that's the reason why your life is stuck.

Because you've got to have certainty, and you won't make a move unless you have it, and therefore you never make a move because you can't ever find it. You're addicted to it, or achievement, some of that's the reason why some of you work yourselves into oblivion, or independence, the reason why many of you are afraid of a commitment, or you know, I'm afraid of dependence, that's the reason why you can never get it, because you so desperately want some by the minute you begin dating them, they can just feel the vacuum cleaner of your heart. These things are, yeah, I know that, you know, that didn't mean it to be funny, you know, sermons moving on is getting near the end, it's a serious, and it's hard to see.

And yet, Agen committed suicide. He knew what the things were, he knew it was going on, he did it anyway, he had to have it so much, he lost everything. And that's because that is what sin does to the heart.

That takes good in this, good desires, and it disorders them to come to cupasins. Now, what are the principles for getting out? First you have to understand the structure, you can take a look and see how Agen fell into it, and then secondly you have to see the basic principles for the healing.

And I must tell you that there's basically the same, even though I don't want anybody to think that in every situation your craving doesn't have particular issues that have to be addressed, as well as the general ones that I'm going to mention now. I don't think that the general ones I'm going to mention would ever be enough to deal with any particular craving, because every craving has both particular and general aspects to it. But I'm going to lay out that which we all have got to deal with if we're going to not be overwhelmed by the temptations that come because of our cravings.

有些东西我们渴求，因为我们渴求它们，我们不成比例地渴求它们。它现在伤害了我们。这里有点难谈论的一件事是指出，当你渴求或上瘾于非常具体的东西时，这更容易一些。

例如，这里有些人，这是纽约，所以我确定这里有些人上瘾于美好的具体事物，比如各种性瘾、私通或色情制品或类似的东西。有赌博，有酒，有饮食失调，在某些方面，你知道，我提到的疑病症，在某些方面，这些至少更容易处理一些。你知道它们在那里，它们是具体的，它们是可见的，在许多情况下它们是物质性的。

但我们其他人呢？你听吗？大多数时候当你最沮丧的时候，大多数时候当你最气馁的时候，大多数时候当你在暴怒中的时候，看看你自己。

这是你会发现的。你如此气馁的原因，你如此绝望的原因，你如此吓坏的原因，你在这样的掌控中的原因是因为你生活中有某些东西，而且通常它不是那么物质化的，不是那么有形的。你生活中有某些东西你想要得过度了。

如果你能对它适度，如果你能说，哎，我想要那个，哎，那会是很棒的事情，但你知道，它不是那么关键。如果你能那样说，你就不会绝望，你可能会失望。你不会苦毒，你可能只是烦躁，你知道。

你不会吓坏，你会担心。但正是因为它不是适度的，因为你必须拥有，因为它是渴求，在我们几乎所有的气馁的底层，在我们几乎所有最深困难的底层就是这个。我们无论看哪里，都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。

我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它是如何变成这样的，能做什么呢？在他本月发行的全新书中，《世界怎么了》，提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。

从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及只有福音如何提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择挣扎，或是在寻找盼望和喜乐，《世界怎么了》将帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛也对我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。

这本新发行的书《世界怎么了》是我们感谢你本月给"生命中的福音"的礼物，帮助分享耶稣的好消息。今天在gospelandlife.com/give获取你的副本，那就是gospelandlife.com/give。现在是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。

你看什么困难的是，当你真的上瘾于确定性时会发生什么？那就是为什么你永远无法做决定，那就是为什么你的生活停滞不前。

因为你必须有确定性，你不会采取行动除非你有它，因此你从不采取行动因为你永远找不到它。你上瘾于它，或成就，那是为什么你们中的一些人把自己工作到遗忘的原因，或独立，那是为什么你们中的许多人害怕承诺的原因，或者你知道，我害怕依赖，那是为什么你永远得不到它的原因，因为你如此拼命地想要某人，你一开始约会他们，他们就能感受到你心中的真空吸尘器。这些东西是，是的，我知道，你知道，这不是有意好笑的，你知道，讲道继续，接近尾声了，这很严肃，而且很难看到。

然而，亚干自杀了。他知道这些东西是什么，他知道发生了什么，他无论如何都做了，他必须如此拥有它，他失去了一切。那是因为罪就是这样对心做的。

它拿走了好东西，好欲望，它使它们紊乱成为情欲。现在，摆脱它的原则是什么？首先你必须理解结构，你可以看看亚干是如何陷入其中的，然后其次你必须看到医治的基本原则。

我必须告诉你，基本上是相同的，尽管我不希望任何人认为在每种情况下你的渴求没有特定的问题需要解决，以及我现在要提到的一般问题。我不认为我要提到的一般问题足以处理任何特定的渴求，因为每一种渴求都有特定和一般两个方面。但我要列出我们所有人都必须处理的，如果我们不想被因我们的渴求而来的试探所压倒。

## 试探的四个步骤 / The Four Steps of Temptation

First of all, look at the structure, there are four steps. Agen does not immediately get in the grip of this thing, there's four steps. You see what he does?

He says, you know, he says, I have sinned, and he says, I saw in the plunder a beautiful road from Babylonia, 200 checkles of silver and a wedge of gold weighing 50 checkles. I coveted them and took them. Now look, first he says, I saw.

This is how temptation works. The word saw is not a Hebrew word that would mean notice. It's the word that's usually translated, behold.

You know, whenever in the Old Testament you have the word behold, what does it mean to behold something? It doesn't mean just to notice something. It means look, look, look.

Behold means to hold it, put it in the center of your attention, consider it, gaze at it. And you notice the first step in temptation is not coveting. In fact, I'm going to show you that's the third step.

The first step of temptation is to move beyond noticing to gazing. The first step in temptation is when you put yourself open to a forbidden thing, not even planning to get it, not even wanting it yet, but just opening yourself to stay there, to be in a place where it can happen. You can't help but notice things because all the good things, you know, that become confupacence for you, are good things.

You can't help but notice them, but the gaze, that's the first step, just being open, just being able to look at a forbidden thing to you without recoiling is the first step. You already entered in. Then the second step, I saw it and said, I'd be held, but then the second step, I weighed.

Now, he said, where does it say that? Well, that's a paraphrase, that's a summary, but look what he says. What did he see?

A beautiful robe from Babylonia, 200 shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold. How did he know how many shekels were in that bag? Well, I noticed there were 200 shekels.

How do you notice there's 200 shekels? You know, it's one thing to notice five. You can notice five, but you can't notice 200.

You've got a gaze, and you've got a count, and you've got to weigh it. How does he know how much the gold weighs? Now, here's what he's doing, the theological term for what he's doing is he was giving them glory.

In Hebrew, the word glory had both a physical and a spiritual connotation. In Hebrew, the word glory means literally and physically weight, but spiritually it meant importance. And the reason those two things have the same, the word can be used in those two ways, the same thing as the word matter.

The English word matter can mean something that's weighty, but it can also mean something of importance. I remember I went to school to college in Central Pennsylvania, and the summer after I graduated from college, the Susquehanna River overflowed its banks during Hurricane Agnes, and just wiped out all kinds of little towns. I went back to the town I went to school, and I noticed that a lot of things were swept away, but the things that weren't swept away were the things that were anchored, the things that were rooted, the things that were weighty, the monuments, the stone houses, but an awful lot of other houses were swept away.

Now, here is the second stage of temptation, the thing that waits something in your life, so that it is not swept away, so it becomes central, so it sticks, so it has impact is your imagination. It's your imagination. Sin is always an inflammation of the imagination.

Your imagination is that which gives glory to something, it's your imagination which looks at the beauty of it and thinks about it, and it fondles it on the palette of your soul. The imagination is the tongue of your soul, the palette. He knew about the honor of God, he knew about the honor of his people, and he also knew how wonderful these things were, but what he did was he set his imagination not on God and not on his people, but he set his imagination on these things, these beautiful things.

In other words, one of the ways some of you may be heard me say it, he knew about the honor of God and the honor of his people, but he put that on audio, but he put these material possessions on video. He let his senses be captivated by them. He gave them glory, and whatever you give glory to you serve, whatever you ascribe the most glory to, and this is a discipline of the mind, and he did it, and as a result, the third step is, I coveted them, well okay, I gazed at them, I weighed them, of course by now I coveted them, what is coveting?

Is to worship something, coveting is to adore something, because whatever you glorify, you will worship, you'll feel drawn to it. His heart was inflamed now, and there's really virtually no stopping it because in the fourth step is, I took them. In other words, what craving does to you, we might think that I can't stop it, but you see this is slow motion, this is great, this is what's great about this verse, it shows us in slow motion, that what craving does, craving knows that there is a glory-fying apparatus in the center of your being, and it takes it over, and therefore drives your life.

首先，看结构，有四个步骤。亚干不是立即陷入这件事的掌控，有四个步骤。你看他做了什么？

他说，你知道，他说，我犯了罪，他说，我在所夺的财物中看见一件美好的巴比伦衣服、二百舍客勒银子、一条金子重五十舍客勒。我贪爱这些物件，便拿去了。现在看，首先他说，我看见。

这就是试探的运作方式。"看见"这个词不是一个希伯来词，意思是注意到。它是通常被翻译为"看哪"的词。

你知道，每当在旧约中你有"看哪"这个词，看哪某事是什么意思？它不仅仅意味着注意到某事。它意味着看，看，看。

看哪意味着抓住它，把它放在你注意力的中心，思考它，凝视它。你会注意到试探的第一步不是贪恋。事实上，我要向你展示那是第三步。

试探的第一步是从注意到转向凝视。试探的第一步是当你向一件禁止的事物敞开自己，甚至还没有计划得到它，甚至还没有想要它，但只是敞开自己留在那里，在一个它可能发生的地方。你无法避免注意到事物，因为所有好的东西，你知道，对你来说成为情欲的，都是好东西。

你无法避免注意到它们，但凝视，那是第一步，只是敞开，只是能够看一件对你来说禁止的事物而不退缩就是第一步。你已经进入了。然后第二步，我看见它并且说，我看哪了，但然后第二步，我称重了。

现在，他说，哪里说的？嗯，那是转述，那是总结，但看他说了什么。他看见了什么？

一件美好的巴比伦衣服，二百舍客勒银子，一条金子。他怎么知道那袋子里有多少舍客勒？嗯，我注意到有二百舍客勒。

你怎么注意到有二百舍客勒？你知道，注意到五个是一回事。你可以注意到五个，但你不能注意到二百个。

你必须凝视，你必须数，你必须称重。他怎么知道金子有多重？现在，这是他在做的，他所做的神学术语是他在给它们荣耀。

在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词既有物质意义也有属灵意义。在希伯来语中，荣耀这个词字面上和物质上意味着重量，但属灵上它意味着重要性。这两件事有相同的原因，这个词可以用在这两种方式上，与英语词matter相同。

英语词matter可以指有分量的东西，但它也可以指重要的东西。我记得我在宾夕法尼亚州中部上大学，在我大学毕业后的那个夏天，萨斯奎汉纳河在阿格尼丝飓风期间溢出了堤岸，摧毁了各种小镇。我回到我上学的城镇，我注意到很多东西被冲走了，但没有被冲走的东西是那些被锚定的东西，那些有根基的东西，那些有分量的东西，纪念碑，石头房子，但很多其他房子被冲走了。

现在，这是试探的第二个阶段，在你生活中称重某物的东西，使它不会被冲走，使它成为中心，使它停留，使它有影响的是你的想象力。是你的想象力。罪总是想象力的炎症。

你的想象力是给某物荣耀的，是你的想象力看它的美丽并思考它，在你灵魂的味觉上爱抚它。想象力是你灵魂的舌头，味觉。他知道神的荣耀，他知道他子民的荣耀，他也知道这些东西有多美好，但他所做的是他把想象力不是放在神身上，不是放在他的子民身上，而是放在这些东西上，这些美丽的东西。

换句话说，你们有些人可能听过我说的一种方式，他知道神的荣耀和他子民的荣耀，但他把那个放在音频上，但他把这些物质财产放在视频上。他让他的感官被它们俘获。他给了它们荣耀，无论你给什么荣耀你就服事什么，无论你把最多的荣耀归给什么，这是一种心智的训练，他做了，结果，第三步是，我贪恋它们，好吧，我凝视它们，我称重它们，当然到现在我贪恋它们，什么是贪恋？

是敬拜某物，贪恋是崇拜某物，因为无论你荣耀什么，你都会敬拜，你会感到被它吸引。他的心现在被点燃了，真的几乎无法阻止它，因为在第四步是，我拿走了它们。换句话说，渴求对你做的，我们可能认为我无法阻止它，但你看这是慢动作，这很棒，这就是这节经文的伟大之处，它以慢动作向我们展示，渴求知道在你存在的中心有一个荣耀化装置，它接管了它，因此驱使你的生活。

## 医治：打破渴求的链条 / The Healing: Breaking the Chain of Craving

Now how do we heal ourselves from it, that's the question then, okay, if that's how it works, if that's how the craving works, in fact you can see there's even stages there, how are we healed from it. For some of you, this is very, very practical, some of you right now have a real problem with self-control in certain areas, sometimes it's very, very physical, is it not a particular sexual problem, a particular physical problem, a particular substance abuse. For others of us it's, you know, this desire, this desperate desire just to be loved, and as a result our lives are being run by it, we want it so much that you see our lives are being run by it, how do we get healed?

I said in a sense there's three steps before you take it, I gazed, I wade, I coveted, and I took, at any one of those three places you can break the chain, you can, you know, you can get off the road, you can get, there's always, there's an exit ramp just before every one of these toll booths, and here's the way, here's the way they work, and after the service, if there's anybody who wants to go in a more detail on them, I have a question answer time downstairs, but I'll just outline them now. The first one is number one, be aware of what you're gazing at, so just notice these things don't gaze at them, and you know, people who, be aware what you're gazing at, nip it in the bud, don't let your mind, don't be in a situation where these things can happen. Now that's maybe too easy, so I'll move right along, people in 12 step programs have already gotten on to that, right?

They get together, and they hold each other accountable, don't go to those places, don't think about those things, don't pay through those books, you know, cut up your credit cards, whatever they do, depending on your craving, but you know, those of us who don't have that kind of nice physical concupissance, we've also got to say, realize what you're looking at during the day, realize where your gaze is, Archbishop William Temple said, use the solitude test, he says, your religion is what you do with your solitude, whatever, when you don't have to think of anything else, do you think about it? What is it that you comfort yourself with, where do your thoughts go to most effortlessly, he says, that's your God, that's worship, proportion, craving? I have another test, I called the unanswered prayer test, what would you say to God about, what would you say to God, Lord, if you do this to me, or if you refuse to give this to me, we're through?

And if you've got anything like that, and most of us do, whatever that is is more important in God, and that is a worship sized thing, that is craving. So realize that you are gazing at things, notice them, but don't gaze at them, don't be in a place where it can happen, okay, but then the second, the only, see, the first is negative, stay away, stop it, turn your mind away, don't think about it, have accountability, call your friend, call your buddy up, but the negative will not be enough. In Hebrews chapter 12, it doesn't just say, let us run the race before us, casting off every sin and every weight that entangles, it doesn't just stop there, it says, and as fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfect of our faith.

Thomas Chalmers in the early 19th century was a Scotsman, he was a pastor, and he was also a Thaithman, and he lived in Edinburgh, and he was very upset with the poverty that he saw in certain parts of the city, and he worked with these people, and he found many of them had these life-dominating habits, and as a result of that work, he wrote a fascinating chapter, which was originally a sermon, and he called it the expulsive power of a new affection, and he said there, this, he said, the only way you can ever release the soul from the power of a beautiful object is to give it a more beautiful object. He says, there's no way you can simply say, turn your mind away from the beautiful object on which you're fixed. The only way to break the power of a beautiful object on your heart is to give it a more beautiful object, and that's the reason why John Dunn put it this way.

He spoke to the Lord, and he says, take me to you, imprison me, for I accept you and you throw me, never shall be free, nor ever chased, except you ravish me. What a risqué thing to say. I, he says, and throw me, take me to you, and prison me, because if you don't imprison me, I'll be imprisoned by something else, and if you don't ravish me, I'll be ravished by something else.

现在我们如何医治自己，那么这就是问题，好的，如果那是它的运作方式，如果那是渴求的运作方式，事实上你可以看到那里甚至有阶段，我们如何被医治。对你们中的一些人来说，这非常、非常实际，你们中的一些人现在在某些领域真的有自制问题，有时它非常、非常物质化，不是一个特定的性问题，一个特定的物质问题，一个特定的药物滥用。对我们其他人来说，这是，你知道，这个欲望，这个拼命想要被爱的欲望，结果我们的生活被它控制，我们如此想要它以至于你看我们的生活被它控制，我们如何得医治？

我说从某种意义上在你拿走它之前有三个步骤，我凝视，我称重，我贪恋，我拿走，在这三个地方中的任何一个你都可以打破链条，你可以，你知道，你可以离开道路，你可以得到，总是有，在每一个这些收费站之前都有一个出口匝道，这是方法，这是它们运作的方式，在礼拜后，如果有任何人想要更详细地了解它们，我在楼下有一个问答时间，但我现在只概述它们。第一个是第一，注意你在凝视什么，所以只是注意这些东西不要凝视它们，你知道，人们，注意你在凝视什么，把它扼杀在萌芽状态，不要让你的心，不要在一个这些事情可能发生的情况下。现在那可能太容易了，所以我马上继续，在12步计划中的人已经知道了那个，对吗？

他们聚在一起，他们彼此问责，不要去那些地方，不要想那些事情，不要翻那些书，你知道，剪掉你的信用卡，无论他们做什么，取决于你的渴求，但你知道，我们那些没有那种美好的物质性情欲的人，我们也必须说，意识到你白天在看什么，意识到你的凝视在哪里，坎特伯雷大主教威廉·坦普尔说，使用孤独测试，他说，你的宗教是你在孤独中做的，无论什么，当你不必想任何其他事情时，你想什么？你用什么安慰自己，你的思想最不费力地去哪里，他说，那就是你的神，那就是敬拜，比例，渴求？我有另一个测试，我称之为未蒙应允的祷告测试，你会对神说什么，你会对神说什么，主啊，如果你这样对我，或如果你拒绝给我这个，我们就完了？

如果你有任何那样的东西，我们大多数人都有，无论那是什么都比神更重要，那是一个敬拜大小的东西，那就是渴求。所以意识到你在凝视事物，注意它们，但不要凝视它们，不要在一个它可能发生的地方，好的，但然后第二个，唯一的，看，第一个是消极的，远离，停止它，转移你的心，不要想它，有问责，打电话给你的朋友，打电话给你的伙伴，但消极的是不够的。在希伯来书第十二章，它不只是说，让我们奔那摆在我们前面的路程，除去各样的罪和容易缠累我们的重担，它不只是停在那里，它说，仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣。

托马斯·查尔默斯在19世纪初是一个苏格兰人，他是一个牧师，他也是一个神学家，他住在爱丁堡，他对他在城市某些地区看到的贫困非常不安，他与这些人一起工作，他发现他们中的许多人有这些主导生活的习惯，由于那项工作，他写了一个迷人的章节，原本是一篇讲道，他称之为新情感的驱逐力量，他在那里说，这个，他说，你能让灵魂从一个美丽物体的力量中释放的唯一方法是给它一个更美丽的物体。他说，你不能简单地说，把你的心从你所专注的美丽物体上转移开。打破一个美丽物体对你心的力量的唯一方法是给它一个更美丽的物体，那就是为什么约翰·多恩这样说。

他对主说，他说，带我到你那里，囚禁我，因为我接受你，你抛掷我，我永远不得自由，也永远不得贞洁，除非你掳掠我。多么大胆的话。我，他说，抛掷我，带我到你那里，囚禁我，因为如果你不囚禁我，我会被别的东西囚禁，如果你不掳掠我,我会被别的东西掳掠。

## 新情感的驱逐力量 / The Expulsive Power of a New Affection

What is it? The heart. Look it, look it, look it.

It's the beautiful thing that you've got to learn in the disciplines of worship and the disciplines of your soul, in the disciplines of your heart, not just to believe in in some general way, but to be ravished by. He is the beautiful thing. He is the new affection which has an expulsive power.

Are you addicted to certainty? Well, the only certainty you really have is that Jesus loves you if you belong to him, and it's the only one you need, and all other certainties won't have that power over you. Are you addicted to achievement?

Well, the only verdict and honor you really have, if you're a Christian, is that Jesus says, you are my beloved child in whom I'm well pleased, and it's the only one you need. If you think about it, and you know, most of the counselors will tell you, addictions are ways for people to numb themselves and anesthetize themselves who don't think they matter. You don't think you matter.

Here's the ultimate cure for that. Why would Jesus Christ die for you? Do you remember some years ago, an airplane crashed into the water in winter time at Washington, D.

C., and one man kept diving back into safe people, remember that? And he dove into safe people, and finally, last time he dove into safe one more person and he didn't make it. And finally, they found his body, and I remember on the TV watching as they hoisted it up and lifted it out of the water.

And as he was lifted up, the people whose lives had been saved, just looked at him. What did they think? One lady on camera said, why did he do that for me?

Jesus Christ says, when I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself. And John 12, and John says, he adds in parenthesis, thereby he showed what kind of death he would die. When he was lifted up, why would he do that for you?

Why would he do that for you? The answer is, you matter. And don't you see the irony of the Christian gospel?

The gospel is, you come to Jesus and you say, Lord Jesus, I give you all the glory. I can't possibly be good enough for the Father to accept me, but because you died for me, because you live for me, I ascribe all glory to you, and I ask that God would save me for your sake. I receive you as my Savior.

When you say that, and you give him all the glory, paradoxically, you get more glory than you can bear, because you come to see that you matter enough that he died for you, and that you matter to the only one in the universe whose opinion matters. And so Lewis himself says, to please God, to be a real ingredient in his joy, to be loved by God, not just pitied, but delighted in as an artist delights in a work, or as a parent in a child, as a weight of glory, our thoughts can hardly sustain, but so it is. Now, there's a third thing you have to do.

If you actually get to the coveting stage and you actually take it, you repent. And if your life is falling apart because it's gone too far, God says, I can make the valley of Acorn, Acore, the door of hope. You may have already been stoned and burned, because you may have gone on to the place where your craving has destroyed your life, you think, no, says God, no.

I tell you, if you repent and come back, and learn to be ravaged with my son, and learn to watch where you gaze, I tell you, I can rebuild you from the ground up. I can make the valley of Acore, a door of hope. Listen.

God calls us glutton to a real feast, the married supper of the lamb, and let me tell you something, when you know there's an incredible dessert coming, you don't eat too much, do you? You eat moderately. What do you say?

You say, no, thank you. I don't want anymore. That was really good.

I don't want anymore. I'm saving some room for dessert, come and see what that is, let's pray. Our Father, we ask that you would make us moderate, that you would show us how important it is to have this kind of stability, but the only way we can possibly break the power of beautiful things on our hearts is to see a more beautiful thing.

Your son is the fairest among 10,000, but especially as he dies on the cross and he's lifted up and he draws us by his beauty, even though he's so broken. It's a beautiful brokenness because it's for us. Let us be so ravished by the thoughts of those things, let us be so good at repentance, let us be so good at watching how we look at things that we find ourselves no longer in the grip of these cravings, but rather waiting for the marriage of the Lamb, eating moderately and enjoying all good things here, for we ask it in Jesus' name.

Amen. Today's sermon was recorded in 1995. The sermons and talks you hear on the Gospel Unliked Podcast were recorded between 1989 and 2017, while Dr.

是什么？心。看，看，看。

这是美丽的事物，你必须在敬拜的训练和你灵魂的训练中学习，在你心的训练中，不只是在某种一般意义上相信，而是被掳掠。他是那美丽的事物。他是具有驱逐力量的新情感。

你上瘾于确定性吗？嗯，如果你属于他，你真正拥有的唯一确定性是耶稣爱你，这是你需要的唯一一个，所有其他确定性不会对你有那种力量。你上瘾于成就吗？

嗯，如果你是基督徒，你真正拥有的唯一判决和荣耀是耶稣说，你是我的爱子，我喜悦你，这是你需要的唯一一个。如果你想想，你知道，大多数辅导员会告诉你，成瘾是人们麻木自己和麻醉自己的方式，他们认为自己不重要。你认为你不重要。

这是对此的终极治疗。为什么耶稣基督会为你死？你记得几年前，一架飞机在冬天坠入华盛顿特区的水中吗？

一个男人不断潜回去救人，记得吗？他潜水救人，最后，最后一次他潜水再救一个人，他没能成功。最后，他们找到了他的身体，我记得在电视上看着他们把它吊起来，从水中抬出来。

当他被抬起来时，那些生命被救的人，只是看着他。他们想什么？一位女士在镜头前说，他为什么为我这样做？

耶稣基督说，我若从地上被举起来，就要吸引万人来归我。在约翰福音12章，约翰加了一句括号说，他这样说是指明自己将要怎样死。当他被举起来时，他为什么为你这样做？

他为什么为你这样做？答案是，你很重要。你没有看到基督教福音的讽刺吗？

福音是，你来到耶稣面前，你说，主耶稣，我把所有荣耀归给你。我不可能足够好让父接纳我，但因为你为我死，因为你为我活，我把所有荣耀归给你，我求神为了你的缘故拯救我。我接受你作我的救主。

当你那样说，你把所有荣耀归给他，矛盾的是，你得到了超过你能承受的荣耀，因为你开始看到你重要到他为你死，你对宇宙中唯一意见重要的那一位来说很重要。所以路易斯自己说，取悦神，成为他喜乐中的一个真正成分，被神所爱，不只是被怜悯，而是被喜悦，如同艺术家喜悦于作品，或父母喜悦于孩子，作为荣耀的分量，我们的思想几乎无法承受，但事实就是如此。现在，你必须做第三件事。

如果你真的到了贪恋阶段并且你真的拿走了它，你悔改。如果你的生活正在崩溃因为它走得太远了，神说，我可以使亚割谷成为指望的门。你可能已经被石头打死并焚烧了，因为你可能已经到了你的渴求摧毁你生活的地步，你想，不，神说，不。

我告诉你，如果你悔改并回来，学习被我的儿子掳掠，学习注意你在凝视哪里，我告诉你，我可以从头开始重建你。我可以使亚割谷成为指望的门。听着。

神呼召我们这些贪食者来到真正的筵席，羔羊的婚筵，让我告诉你一些事，当你知道有一个令人难以置信的甜点要来时，你不会吃太多，对吗？你会适度地吃。你会说什么？

你会说，不，谢谢。我不想要更多了。那真的很好。

我不想要更多了。我要留点空间吃甜点，来看看那是什么，让我们祷告。我们的父，我们祈求你使我们适度，你向我们显明拥有这种稳定性有多重要，但我们能打破美丽事物对我们心的力量的唯一方法是看到一个更美丽的事物。

你的儿子是万人中的佳偶，但特别是当他死在十字架上，他被举起来，他以他的美丽吸引我们，即使他是如此破碎。这是美丽的破碎，因为那是为我们。让我们被那些事情的思想如此掳掠，让我们如此擅长悔改，让我们如此擅长注意我们如何看事物，以至于我们发现自己不再在这些渴求的掌控中，而是等候羔羊的婚筵，适度地吃，享受这里所有的好东西，因为我们奉耶稣的名求。
