# Integrity / Integrity

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in life. The Bible tells us there's a difference between outward self-control and the deep lasting change only the Holy Spirit can bring. In Galatians 5 Paul calls these inner transformations the fruit of the Spirit.

Love, joy, peace, patience, and more. Join us today as Tim Keller explores one of the fruit of the Spirit. The reading for today is taken from the Book of Ephesians chapter 4 verses 14 and 15, 20 through 25 and verse 29.

Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the head that is Christ. You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.

Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him according with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitudes of your minds, and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.

Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who will listen. This is the word of the Lord. Galatians 5, verses 22 to 23, lists what's called the fruit of the Spirit.

These are characteristics, descriptors of a supernaturally changed heart, love, joy, peace, patience, and we're looking at one each week so that perhaps we can have more of the supernatural change in our own lives. Today we come to faithfulness. The word faithfulness is honesty, integrity, truthfulness, and this is a great text that we're going to be looking at so we can take a deeper look at what that means.

There couldn't be a more relevant topic. Because of the economic crisis, the recession, and the revelations that have come out, since then, our trust, Americans trust of their institutions, business, government, church, is that an all-time low, all the studies show that, because there is a sense that there's been a failure of integrity in our society at all levels. And what does the Bible have to say about this, therefore, very relevant and all-important subject?

This particular text is going to show us that there are two problems with regard to truth. There's a problem of practicing truthfulness, but then there's also a problem of abusing people with the truth. So there's a problem of practicing truth, and then there's a problem of abusing people with the truth, and then we're going to see what the solution is, how we solve both problems.

Okay? First, first there's the problem of practicing truth. It's a very demanding thing, according to the Bible, and what's great about this passage is there's three very important aspects to being truthful people that are all mentioned.

What does it mean to be truthful? First, it means to refuse to deceive people, to not deceive people. Notice verse 14 and 15, verse 15 says, instead speak the truth, instead of what?

And in verse 14 it says, cunning, craftiness, and deceit. Now, this is extremely important, because if you and I tend to think of lying strictly as conveying inaccurate statements. But the Bible long ago understood what today is called speech act theory.

You know what speech act theory is? Speech act theory is the insight that every word is actually also a deed. We tend to say word deed or two different things, but every word is really a deed.

That is, every word is not only designed to convey information, it's also designed to get something done. It's got an intention, it's got a purpose. And in order to evaluate a word, or a phrase, you need to not only evaluate whether it's conveying fruit, accurate information, but also evaluate what its purpose is.

So for example, there's been a theft at the office, your office. And you know, Mr. A did it, but you want to protect and cover for Mr.

A. So the investigators come. And you don't want to lie to them, see?

And they say, who did it? What did you see? And you say, I saw Mr.

B there that very night. Is that a lie? Technically, you're telling the per- you're saying what actually happened.

It's factually true. Mr. B was there that night.

You did see Mr. B there that night. But what's the purpose of this statement?

It's misdirection. It's to hide. It's to deceive.

You're trying to get them to run down. You know, you're throwing them a red herring. And therefore, what is, according to the Bible, an untruthful word?

An untruthful word is any word that deliberately tries to hide reality from the listener. Every listener that asks you a question, if you lie to them, that means you are deliberately withholding reality as you know it to be from them. And therefore, if you're deceiving, whether or not what you said is technically true or not, that's a lie.

And it's wrong. And as a result, by the way, what that does mean is once you realize what the Bible is saying here, it does expand your understanding. Does it not?

A untruthful speech? So somebody once made this little list, polite lies, euphemisms, exaggerations, word inflation, and so-called benevolent lies. But they're all lies.

So here's a polite lie. I would love to go, but I'll be out of town. But you won't be out of town.

Here's a euphemism. I think your writing is too sophisticated for our readers. When you mean it's too terrible for our readers.

But you don't want to say it's terrible. You upset them. It's a euphemism.

It's a lie, see? Exaggeration. This works inside marriage.

You always, you never went out, of course, that's not true because the person you are berating sometimes does or sometimes does, but when you say you always, you never, what you're actually what speech act theory here, you know, even if it's pretty much true, you're bludgeoning the person besides that you're exaggerating. So the person's going to find the part of what you're saying that's wrong and just going to inflame things. You're going to be up very late tonight.

Or word inflation. And here's something. Now think about this, everybody.

This is something that Christians do particularly, but it can be done everywhere. Whenever public discourse in a church is, it was, it's such a blessing. The Lord was there.

It was just incredible. Now what happens is sometimes the Lord is there and sometimes it is a blessing and sometimes it's incredible. When it's always a blessing, it's always incredible.

You're just creating cynicism, especially amongst your kids. Just creating cynicism. It's word inflation.

So what you're actually doing is it's not, it's deceptive. It's just a way of always, it's hype. Hype is deceptive.

Hype isn't reality. And then you've got a whole pile of the little, what you call benevolent lies. There's enabling lives like when you continually lie for an incompetent friend, when you actually ought to be confronting him or her about how they're living.

Or then you have watergate lies. You know what watergate lies are? Watergate lies are, well the little people wouldn't understand.

It's just too complicated for them. So this is what I'm going to say. This is all deception.

To live a life of truthfulness means to refuse to deceive. Number one, number two. Secondly, to live a life of truthfulness according to the Bible is to make and keep promises.

That actually comes out, though you might not see it immediately, in verse 25. We should, if you're a Christian, you should tell the truth everybody, of course. But in verse 25, it actually says, speak truthfully to your neighbor.

Now that might sound in that case like anybody, but then it says, for we are members of one body. And here he's talking about Christian to Christian. And that members of one body is a covenant image.

A covenant is an agreement. A covenant is a commitment. A covenant is a public commitment you enter into by signing a contract or making a promise.

And here we're told the Christians are people who are not afraid of. They make and they keep promises. We live in a culture in which there is so much emphasis on personal freedom, personal freedom, keeping your options open, that people no longer make promises at places that they used to.

And if they do make them, they feel very, very free to break them as soon as it entails any self-denial at all. Let me just give you two examples and I'll immediately backpile. Two examples of places where people used to make promises, but now they don't make promises.

One is living together without being married. Secondly, being very involved in the church without joining. In both cases, you're not making the promise that you used it.

Now right away, somebody is going to say, are you equating those two things? I am not equating them. I'm not saying they're equally wrong or bad.

What I'm saying is 40 years ago, neither of them happened very much. And the reason they didn't happen very much was because the idea of making a promise and nailing it down and committing yourself in a sense, committing yourself and shutting down your options wasn't considered the horrible thing that it is today, but it is. And so it permeates us all.

And one of the problems is that we actually think, one of the reasons is we're so big on our freedom that we feel like if I make promises and I make commitments and I stick with them, that somehow I lose my freedom and that is not true at all. Lewis Meads, in his great book, Mayor Morality, which is an exhibition of the Ten Commandments, talks about this at one place. He's talking about making promises and keeping commitments and taking vows.

And he's thinking, you can hear when he talks about it, he's thinking somewhat about the marriage vow, but he's actually what he's saying in this quote, is true of all promises and all commitments. He says this, when we make a promise, we take it on ourselves to create a future with someone else, no matter what fate or destiny may have in store. This is almost ultimate freedom.

When I make a promise, I bear witness that my future with you is not determined by the hand I was dealt out of my family's genetic deck. When I make a promise, I testify that I was not routed along some unalterable itinerary by the psychic conditioning visited on me by my slightly wacky parents. I am not faded, I am not determined, I am not a lump of human dough whipped into shape by the contingent reinforcement and averse of conditioning in my past.

Now I know as well as the next person that much of what I am and what I do is a gift or a curse from my past, but when I make a promise to anyone, I rise above all the conditioning that limits me, no German shepherd ever promised to be there with me, no computer ever promised to be loyal for life, only a person can make a promise and when he does, he is most free. You see, when you say, but if I make that promise, if I make that commitment, if I promise to be there, then I won't have my freedom, and what he's saying is the opposite, don't you realize that if you don't make a promise, then you are a slave to circumstances, you're a slave to feelings, you're a slave to fears, you're a slave to impulses, make a promise. And that's your way of saying, this is the way I'm going to be and I don't care about whatever else happens, and that makes you more free.

And to be people of integrity, we should be people who are not afraid of making promises and keeping promises. So refusing to deceive, making keeping promises and the third aspect of what it means to practice the truth and be truthful is integrity of selves, plural, integrity of selves. Look at verse 25, where it says, therefore each of you must put off falsehood.

But you know what it says in the original Greek is, you must put off the pseudo. That's the Greek word, the pseudo. And this is what he is talking about.

Think of the word integrity. In English, it's the same as the word integer. What is an integer?

It's a whole number, not a fraction, something that can't be divided. It's a whole number. What is integrity?

A person of integrity has the same self in every place. You don't have a pseudo self in a real self. So for example, a person who lacks integrity is one way in private and another way in public.

This is the reason why politicians should be really careful about those live microphones. You're one way in private and another way in public. Without integrity, you are one way with this group and a total another way with this group.

You talk a completely different line than this, what you say, what you say you believe, it's totally different. A person of integrity, however, is the same in private as in public. The same with this group as with that group.

The same in what you think with what you say and the same with what you say with what you do. You don't have multiple selves, a real self and a bunch of pseudo selves. You've got one self, one real self.

And boys is lacking. If I had time, I would talk about all the cultural reasons why we're actually encouraged by the culture to create totally different selves. What do you think?

What do you think all those internet names are? You create totally different selves. We're encouraged by it.

But let me just give you one example of how devastating it is in just one area, which I mentioned at the top, which is business. A man who was some years ago just writing a book on how to have integrity as a business leader just wrote these things. Now, I just pulled them off because they're routine, but they also are very revealing.

He says, don't say publicly where for quality, but privately you have unreasonable deadlines and all your employees know it. Don't take friends to company box seats when everybody knows you should only be bringing clients there. Don't say publicly everything is fine when all your employees know everything is not fine.

Don't give huge perks to management and not to others. Don't put in a big number of orders right before the end of the quarter because even though you know they will all be cancelled, it will look so good in the figures for the quarter. When you hear that kind of thing, you suddenly realize, oh my word, we just swim in that.

I'm back to the illustration. Don't ask a fish to tell you about water because then the fish will say, well, what's water? Because the fish is so in the water, the fish doesn't even see the earth's water.

And maybe we're getting to the place where we can't even say to people in business, in government, in the church, in real life, just life, be people of integrity because they don't even know what that is because they're so used to the kind of behavior that this man said, don't do, don't do, but we just swim in it. It's just everywhere. All through this passage, the reason why we should be truthful comes back to God.

Does it not? We should be righteous and truthful and holy because God is truthful and righteous and holy. And the implication of that, if you're a Christian believer, is astonishing.

There's a place in the Sermon on the Mount. When you read through the Sermon on the Mount, a lot of this stuff makes sense. When you get to this place, it doesn't seem to make sense.

It's about oaths. And there's a place where Jesus says, don't swear by the city of Jerusalem and don't swear by your head, but let your yes be yes, and let your no be no. And you say, what?

And here's what he meant by that. In those days, it was understood or believed that if you swore by God, the name of God, then you couldn't ever break your oath. That probably goes to their understanding of the 10 commandments, which says, you must not take the name of the Lord that God invades, which means you must never take the name of God on and then not follow through.

If you invoke God's name, then you better follow through. But they said, if you swear on something else, if you swear on your father's grave, or if you swear on the city of Jerusalem, or if you swear on your own head, that's different. If you make a promise like that, it's not so bad if you break it.

And you know what Jesus is saying, don't you dare believe that. He says, don't you understand? Jerusalem is God's city.

Your head is God's, God made your head. Your father's grave is God's. He says, don't you realize that every yes and every no, everything you say every day, every idle word is under oath, as much under oath as if you were because you are standing before the throne of the great king.

Absolutely, there's no levels of truthfulness. Absolutely, everything you say is actually under oath. If I told you that tomorrow somebody's going to follow you around and it's going to video, every single thing you do and every single thing you say, would you speak with more integrity?

Would you be more careful? How you spoke to your spouse or to your friends or to the person that you're pitching a deal to, a prospective client, would you be at all more careful? If you knew it was being recorded and then tomorrow it was going to be put up on the internet, would you be more careful?

I would and you would. And if we're Christians, we're fools. Because it's true that we would be more careful.

And yet Jesus Christ says, don't you realize you're you're under way more scrutiny than that. Every single one of your words is being held a far greater accountability than a few thousand people watching it on the internet. God, the God of truth, the God of righteousness, the God of holiness, you're standing right before Him.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the Songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight.

If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus with more people.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. So you see the problem and the difficulty of practicing the truth, but that's not the only problem that Paul brings out here. It's not the only problem with regard to the truth.

There's a second problem and it's fascinating to me. He hints at it in verse 15. When he doesn't just say, instead speak the truth in love.

He doesn't just say speak the truth. He says speak the truth in love. Doesn't just say speak the truth.

He says in love. Okay, well that's nice. When you look at that, you kind of think, okay, so be truthful but add love.

So truth is one thing and love is another thing. But when you get down to verse 29, the last verse, then you see how remarkable what a remarkable point Paul is making because he says, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth. That word unwholesome literally means rotten.

It's a word that means putrefying. It's a word that means leading to decay and disintegration. Okay.

And then so what is an unwholesome word? An unwholesome word is anything that is not supposed, is not designed to build up, not designed to benefit. And you say, what does that mean?

The true words that are not designed to build up and benefit the person. Even true words are rotten. And the answer is yes, that's what Paul is saying.

Rotten. So what are unwholesome words? What does this mean?

Well on the one hand, you know, I still always am, I'm always amazed by the one place in Henry V in the play, the Shakespeare play Henry V when he's just hung a man for, you know, he's, they're invading France and the English are invading France and he hangs a man for pillaging, I think. And at one point, he turns around and he actually says to all of his soldiers, he says, I will not have the French upgraded nor abused in disdainful language. Okay.

Yeah, we're here to conquer them but we're not. We're not going to speak disdainfully. We're not going to abrade them.

Now that clearly is what it means, but I believe Paul is not just talking about abusive, you know, angry harsh tones, though he certainly is saying that. If you say the truth, in abusive, harsh, angry ways, that's rotten, that stinks, that's wrong, that's sinful. What I'm telling the truth, it doesn't matter and here's the reason why.

When you tell the truth in abusive ways, when you beat people up with the truth, are you really caring about the truth? Are you really valiant for the truth? No, you're valiant for yourself.

But Paul's not only talking about, I think, overtly abusive words. He is saying anything that's not actually designed to benefit and build up. That's amazing.

When you tell the truth to somebody, is your goal? Here we are back to speech act theory. Okay, maybe what you're saying is true, technically true, doctrinally true, you know, accurate, but are you trying to marginalize the person in the eyes of others?

Are you trying to beat the person up? Are you trying to punish them? Are you trying to put them in their place?

Are you trying to get applause from other people because you're being so hard on them? Paul says none of those are right. Anyone who uses the truth basically to beat the person up in order to get more power and status for yourself is abusing the truth.

And you're not valiant for the truth, you're valiant for yourself. You're using the truth for your own power and status. And at this point, by the way, you realize that we're coming to a place where we're coming to one of the main objections that the world out there today, especially in our culture, has about the church.

Foucault, Nietzsche, those kinds of people, have said now for years that when Christians claim to have the truth, they're really basically just using the truth to get on top. So Foucault is a famous place where the French philosopher Foucault says truth is a thing of this world. It is produced by virtue of multiple forms of constraint and it induces regular effects of power.

Each society has its regime of truth. He says basically truth claims our power plays. Now what should Christians do when they hear that?

I'll tell you what they should do according to the Bible. The first thing they should do is not get their backup and say, wait a minute, there really is absolute truth. They should repent.

And here's why. Long before Foucault, long before Nietzsche, long before Marx, Jesus said this, he says, woe to you Pharisees because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you because you load people down with burdens they can hardly bear but do not lift a finger to help them.

What's he talking about? He's talking about people who use the law of God, the truth, the Bible to get the place, the right places in society, the high status, and to keep people down. That's exactly what Foucault and exactly with Nietzsche.

Yes. See Jesus Christ years ago used the gospel to dismantle what Paul is talking about and what so many people in the world who don't like Christianity complain about. If you get your sense of worth and value out of the free grace of God, if the reason why you know you're worth anything is just the free love and grace of God.

Then the truth of God just becomes a way of delighting him. It's something you love. So if you get your sense of value from the grace of God, you love the truth.

But if you get your sense of value from being right, if you get your sense of value and worth from having the truth and being accurate and being value for the truth instead of God, you say you're looking to the truth to give you what only God can give you. A sense that you must be a valuable important person because you know the truth so well and so forth. See Jesus years ago called that moralism, Phariseism, and dismantled it.

And therefore Christians are in some ways standing on a very narrow piece of ground. In fact, to most of the roads invisible because over here you have people who basically say who's to say what truth is? What is truth?

You know everybody has to decide what truth is for him or herself. They either deny the fact that there is truth or they play fast and loose with the truth. And on the other side you've got people who say yes there is truth and here's absolute truth and they beat people up with it and Jesus says Paul says both of those are rotten.

And if you're a person of integrity you don't do either. And a person who uses the truth to beat people up is not really valid for the truth, you're valid for yourself. And you know the non-Christian thinkers out there see it and know it.

So there are the two problems. You know the one hand we're afraid we're afraid to be truthful. You know what's you know what's hard about about telling truth all the time.

You know what's hard about keeping promises and making promises. You know what's hard about integrity. It's scary.

You know it's scary. I mean if I tell the truth all the time if I just let everybody up but then you know we're afraid and that's why we lie. That's why I have always lied.

When I lie I lie because I'm afraid. But on another hand you have pride. You know smart Luther said that the Christians are like a drunk man who having fallen off of the horse on the one side promptly gets up on the horse and falls off on the other.

And so we are now stuck between I would cook I would have to say two cultures. Listen to me. On the one hand we really do have a problem.

We have a culture that is relativistic. It really is. They do say who's to say what is truth.

Nobody can say what is right wrong. All truth and morality is culturally relative. Now one of the bad problems we have there and it's almost a joke is then we get real upset.

We tell kids there is no right or wrong. You have to decide yourself. There is no such thing as truth and then we get all upset when they get out into society and they lie and they cheat.

C. S. Lewis in his abolition of man puts it like this.

We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor. You know we laugh at the idea of honor and truth.

We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate and bid the gildings be fruitful. And he's what he's saying there.

He says we tell kids all truth and morality is culturally relative. Who's to say what is truth and then it says we clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. Look at all this corruption.

Look at all these people cheating. Look at all these people not being honest. Truth is relative but why aren't you honest?

We clamor for the very qualities we are rendering impossible. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traders in our midst. We castrate them and then we build the gildings be fruitful and develop virtue and honesty and integrity and they can't.

And so on the one hand we are living in a society like that but therefore the danger is to react and become people who use unwholesome words. People who use the truth not to build up and not to benefit. You know we attack not the problem but the person when we use the truth.

So we have the truth party. We have the truth and nobody else. And we have the love party.

Ah this just accept everybody but here's the problem. Truth without love is not really truth. It is a power grab and love without truth is not really love.

It's cowardice or intellectual laziness. Truth and love have to be together or they're not themselves. Got that?

That's what Paul is saying here. Love without truth isn't truth and truth without love. Truth that love isn't truth and love without truth isn't love.

Unless they're together they're not themselves. So what are we going to do? Here's what we're going to do.

In John chapter 18 I just noticed this this week there's really two trials. Jesus first is dragged before the high priest before they you know before his crucifixion he's dragged before the high priest and they religious leaders and then the same chapters drag before pilot. Now when he's dragged before the high priest you know what he says?

High testified to the truth and they smack him. But then when he gets in front of pilot he uses almost exactly the same words I testified to the truth. And you know what pilot says?

What is truth? And then they kill him. I want you to behold the wonder of this.

First of all I want you to behold the wonder of the integrity of Jesus. Jesus Christ, what a man of integrity. Why?

He's the same both places. There's no pseudo about Jesus. He's the same in one place as another.

Here's the moralists, right? The people that he has the religious leaders that he has been denouncing as moralists. Here's the moralists.

He says the same thing. Here's the relativists. What is truth says pilot and he's exactly the same.

He's not two different kinds of people and notice this. He's not only the same in both places but they both hate him. They both smack him.

They both kill him. Why? Because here's what's so weird.

The relativists and the moralists both are about power. The reason the relativists says who's to say what truth is is to get power. The reason why the moralist says I have the truth is about power.

But Jesus Christ is the exact opposite. He is standing on his integrity, absolute integrity. I testify the truth.

He says the same and it gets him killed. Why? Because he's using the truth to serve us.

They're using the truth to get power over us. His integrity took him to the cross. But why did he want to go to the cross?

And here is the solution. May I ask you a question? Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth?

Was that why he went? To show that God's law cannot be broken. To show that God's holiness and his righteousness has to be satisfied.

Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of the truth? Or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for the sake of love so that we could be pardoned so we could be forgiven in spite of our sins? So we could be embraced so we could be accepted.

Okay everybody. Did Jesus Christ go to the cross for truth or did Jesus Christ go to the cross for love? And the answer is yes.

The minute he died, the truth of God was infinitely satisfied because he fulfilled all the requirements of the love God. But the minute Jesus died, the love of God was infinitely satisfied because now he can embrace us and pardon us and forgive us and receive us in spite of our sins. The cross brought truth and love together.

I know in the world and sometimes in our lives it seems like they're at loggerheads. But if I tell the truth, I don't know if that's loving or if I really, in other words they seem at loggerheads but on the cross they were not at loggerheads and when the cross comes into the center of your life they won't be either. You know why?

It keeps you from the fear that makes you a person who plays fast and loses the truth because Jesus Christ loved you so much that he died for you, but it also keeps you from the pride that makes you a person who might abuse with the truth because Jesus Christ had to die for you. You're that sinful. So the pride that leads you to abuse people with the truth is taken away by the cross.

The fear that leads us to duck and dive and play with the truth is taken away. Our hearts are so filled with love that here's what we can do. Verse 29, I know that the translation says you should only do what will benefit those who listen but literally the Greek says you should only say that which will give grace to those who listen.

When you get the grace from the cross of Jesus Christ then you can speak the truth graciously and only then or you could put it one other way. Yeah, as Mr. Incredible once said, I got time.

We can do one, let me tell you one more thing. In the beginning, don't think about that too much. In the beginning of history, it was a disaster.

Adam and Eve, you know, Garden of Eden, what happens? Sin, serpent, you know the story. Everything's horrible, death, destruction, evil, everything's horrible except there's a glimmer of hope.

You know what it is? It's a promise. Genesis 3, 15, God says, I promise that one descendant of Eve is someday going to bruise the head of the serpent, destroy evil.

I promise. Scroll forward centuries later. God starts talking to Abram says, I'm going to say the world through your descendants and one night Abram says, but how can I be sure?

And in Genesis 15, God shocks Abraham and he shocks anybody who understands what he's doing in Genesis 15 when he appears and he passes between the pieces of a dead animal and he says, I will save the world through one of your descendants even if it means I have to die. A second promise. And then years later, Jesus Christ comes into the world and he's a man of complete integrity, complete integrity.

He always means what he says, always says what he means, absolute integrity, but at the very end in the ultimate act of integrity, he sets his face like a flint to go to Jerusalem and he goes to the cross, why? He's fulfilling his promise. He's fulfilling the promise of God.

And everything's before him. Everything comes down. Everything opposes him.

Hell itself comes down and he says, no, I've made a promise and he goes to the cross and he dies for us. You've been saved by the integrity of Jesus. You've been saved by the promise keeping of Jesus Christ.

That should humble us away from ever using truth against people, but on the other hand, it convinces us there is a truth where we can't be at all. And it destroys our fear of telling the truth and therefore, oh, friends, look at the integrity of Jesus, look at what he did for you on the cross and become people of integrity. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, for giving us this vision of Jesus Christ who kept all his promises. He was a man of integrity. He used the truth to save us, not to exploit us.

Our Father, when we deny the truth or fail to speak the truth, to save our next, or when we abuse people with the truth, to get the power and status we want, we are just turning our eyes away from your Son. Who was the way the truth and the life, but who on the cross gave us forever a vision of how truth and love are joined together. They're one flesh, never to be parted, and we pray that the vision of what Jesus did on the cross would enable the truth and love to grow in our own lives, go hand in hand.

We pray you make us a community of integrity. We pray that you'd help us to know how to speak the truth in our culture right now that doesn't want to hear it. We pray, Lord, that you would help us to know what it needs to be, people of integrity.

We ask this in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it, and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and to share it with others.

欢迎来到生命中的福音。圣经告诉我们，外表的自制与圣灵带来的深刻持久改变之间是有区别的。在《加拉太书》5章中，保罗称这些内心的转变是圣灵的果子。爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐，还有更多。

今天，让我们和提摩太·凯勒一起探讨圣灵的果子之一。今天的经文选自《以弗所书》4章14至15节，20至25节以及第29节。那时我们不再做婴孩，任凭自己被风吹浮，东摇西晃；而是要按着真理彼此说诚实话，在爱中成长。因为我们是基督的身体各部分。

你们岂不知，你们的身子就是圣灵的殿吗？你们错了！你们曾听闻并学习了祂，并在祂里面按照耶稣的真理行事为人。你们从前照旧的生活方式已经过去，要脱去旧人，这人因私欲而败坏；要更新心思意念，在基督里成为新人。

这新人是按着神的形象造的，有真实的公义和圣洁。因此，你们各人都要弃绝谎言，只说诚实、正直的话，因为你们都是基督的身体的一部分。不要让不纯的话语从你们口中出来，而是要说有益于建造彼此话语，根据需要来帮助听的人得益处。这是主的话。

《加拉太书》5章22至23节列出了圣灵的果子。这些是被神超自然改变的心所具备的特点：爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐，我们每周探讨一个，希望这样能让我们在生活中经历更多的这种超自然的改变。今天我们要讨论的是忠诚。这个词指的是诚实、正直和真实，这是一段很好的经文，可以帮助我们更深入地理解其含义。

这个话题再合适不过了。由于经济危机、衰退以及随之而来的种种揭露，美国民众对机构、商业、政府和教会的信任达到了前所未有的低点，所有研究都显示了这一点，因为人们感到社会各个层面的诚信出现了失败。那么，《圣经》对此有什么看法呢？因此，这是一个非常相关且重要的主题。

这段经文将向我们展示两个关于真理的问题：一个是实践诚实的问题，另一个是滥用真相的问题。所以，我们将看到这两个问题及其解决方案是什么。首先，让我们来看看实践诚实的问题。根据《圣经》，这是一项极其艰难的任务。

这段经文特别重要，因为它提到了成为诚实人的三个非常关键的方面。什么是诚实？首先，它意味着拒绝欺骗他人，不欺骗他人。请注意第14节和15节，第15节说要讲真话，而不是什么？

在第14节中提到的是诡诈、狡猾和欺诈。这非常重要，因为如果我们认为撒谎只是传达错误的信息，但《圣经》很久以前就理解了今天所谓的言语行为理论。你知道什么是言语行为理论吗？言语行为理论是指每一个词实际上也是一种行动。

我们通常会把“言”和“行”视为两回事，但实际上每个词都是一个行动。也就是说，每个词不仅设计用来传达信息，还设计用来完成某件事。它有目的，有意图。因此，在评估一个词或短语时，不仅要评估它是否传达了准确的信息，还要评估它的目的是什么。

例如，办公室里发生了盗窃案，你知道是A先生干的，但你想要保护并包庇他。A. 所以调查人员来了。你不想对他们撒谎，对吧？他们问：“是谁干的？

你看到了什么？”你说：“那天晚上我看到B先生在那里。”这算撒谎吗？从技术上讲，你在说事实，那天晚上B先生确实在那里。

你确实看到了B先生那天晚上在那里。但这句话的目的何在？这是转移注意力，是隐瞒，是欺骗。你想让他们追查错的人。

你知道的，你在给他们扔一个烟幕弹。因此，根据圣经，什么是不真实的言语？不真实的言语是指故意试图从听者那里隐藏事实的任何话语。每一个向你提问的听者，如果你对他们撒谎，就意味着你故意隐瞒了你知道的事实真相。

因此，即使你说的话在技术上是正确的，但如果是欺骗性的，那就是谎言。这是错误的行为。顺便说一句，这意味着一旦你明白圣经在这里所说的，它确实会扩展你的理解，不是吗？不真实的言语？

有人曾经列了一个小清单：礼貌的谎言、委婉语、夸大其词、言辞膨胀以及所谓的善意谎言，但这些都是谎言。这里有一个礼貌的谎言：“我很想去，但我得出差。”但实际上你不会出差。这里是一个委婉语：“我认为你的文章对我们的读者来说太复杂了。

”实际上你想说的是“你们的读者无法理解”。你不想让他们感到沮丧。这是一种委婉语。这是一种谎言，明白吗？

夸大其词。这在婚姻中很常见。你说：“你从不外出。”当然，这不是真的，因为被指责的人有时确实会出去，但当你用“从不”这个词时，你实际上是在通过言语行为理论打击对方，并且在夸大事实。

所以对方会发现你话中的错误部分，从而加剧争端。今晚你会很晚才睡。或者言辞膨胀。这里有一个例子。

请大家想想这个： 这段是基督徒特别做的事情，但也可以在任何地方做到。每当教会中有公开讨论时，那真是极大的祝福。主就在那里。这真是太不可思议了。

现在的情况是，有时候主在那里，有时候是祝福，有时候是不可思议的事情。当它总是成为祝福的时候，那就是永远的不可思议。你只是在制造怀疑论，尤其是对你的孩子来说。你在制造怀疑论。

这是词汇膨胀。所以实际上你所做的就是欺骗性的。这只是不断夸大其词。夸大其词是欺骗性的。

夸大其词不是现实。然后你还有一大堆所谓的善意谎言。比如，当你不断地为一个无能的朋友说谎，而实际上你应该去面对他或她的生活方式时，这就是在纵容他的生活。或者还有水门事件式的谎言。

你知道什么是水门事件式的谎言吗？水门事件式的谎言是，小人物不懂这些。这太复杂了，他们不明白。所以我说的就是这个，这些都是欺骗。

过一种诚实的生活意味着拒绝欺骗。第一点，第二点。其次，根据圣经过一种诚实的生活就是遵守诺言和履行承诺。虽然你可能不会立刻看到这一点，但其实出现在第25节中。

作为基督徒，你应该对每一个人说真话，当然了。但在第25节中，它实际上说的是要对你邻舍说实话。现在这听起来像是对任何人，但它接着说，“因为我们是一个身体的成员。”这里他指的是基督徒之间的关系。

而“一个身体的成员”是一个盟约的形象。盟约是一种协议，一种承诺。盟约是通过签署合同或做出承诺而进入的一种公开承诺。在这里我们被告知，基督徒是那些不怕做承诺并遵守承诺的人。

我们现在生活在一个强调个人自由、保持选择开放的文化中，以至于人们不再像过去那样轻易地做出承诺了。如果他们确实做出了承诺，那么只要涉及自我克制，他们就感觉非常自由地违背这些承诺。让我举两个例子，然后马上解释。一个是未婚同居，另一个是积极参与教会活动但不加入其中。

在两种情况下，你们都没有做出过去所作的承诺。立刻有人会问：你把这两者等同起来了吗？我没有等同它们。我不是说它们同样错误或糟糕。

我只是说，在40年前，这两种情况几乎不存在。它们之所以不存在，是因为当时人们认为许诺、坚守和自我约束——即关闭自己的选择——并不是今天所认为的可怕行为，但如今确实如此。这种观念已经渗透到我们每个人身上。其中一个问题是，我们认为自己过于强调自由。

如果我们做出承诺并坚持下去，反而会失去自由，这是不对的。莱斯利·米德在他的著作《市长美德》中谈到了这一点，这本书是对十诫的展览。他在书中讨论了许诺、遵守承诺和誓言的问题。当谈到许诺时，你可以听到他思考着婚姻誓约，但他实际上所说的适用于所有类型的承诺。

他说过：“当我们做出承诺时，我们承担起与他人共同创造未来的责任，无论命运或宿命如何安排。” 这几乎就是终极的自由。当我许下诺言时，我见证了我的未来与你们无关乎家庭遗传的那张牌。当我许下诺言时，我在作证：我不是被父母那些微不足道的行为模式所决定的命运之车上的乘客。

我不只是褪色的存在，不被束缚，不是由过去条件反射和反向强化塑造的一团人类面团。我也知道，我现在的许多言行确实受过去的恩赐或诅咒影响，但当我对任何人许下诺言时，我会超越所有限制我的条件。没有哪只德国牧羊犬曾承诺会一直陪在我身边，也没有任何一台电脑能保证终身忠诚，只有人才能许下诺言，并且当一个人这样做时，他才是最自由的。你看，当你认为如果我许下了那个诺言、做出了那个承诺、答应了要陪伴你，那我就失去了自由，而实际上他说的是相反的意思：如果你不做出承诺，那你就会成为环境的奴隶、情绪的奴隶、恐惧的奴隶、冲动的奴隶。

做出承诺吧，**这是你的选择——以这种方式做自己，并不在乎其他发生的一切，这会让你更加自由。因此，作为有诚信的人，我们应该勇于许诺并履行诺言。拒绝欺骗，坚持兑现承诺是实践真理**和诚实的第三个方面——即个人自我完整性的体现。看第25节：“所以你们要弃绝谎言。

” 但你知道，在原始希腊文中，它说的是“抛弃伪善”。这就是他所指的内容。想想这个词“诚信”。“诚信”在英文中与整数(integer)同义。

什么是整数？整数是一个完整的数字，不是分数，不能被分割的完整数字。那么，“诚信”是什么呢？一个有品格的人在任何地方都是一样的。

你没有真实的自我和虚假的自我。比如，一个缺乏品格的人，在私下里是这样表现的，在公开场合又是另外一种样子。这就是为什么政治家要特别小心那些现场直播的话筒。你在私下里是这样，在公开场合又是那样。

没有品格，你就对这个团体说一套，对那个团体又是一套。你说的话和你相信的东西完全不同。然而，一个有品格的人在私下里和公开场合是一样的。与这个团体时也一样，与那个团体也是同样的。

你的思想、所说的话和所做的事都是一致的。你只有一个真实的自我，而不是多个自我，包括一些虚假的自我。缺乏这一点真是太糟糕了。如果我有时间，我会谈谈文化上为什么鼓励我们创造完全不同的自我。

你们觉得呢？你觉得那些网络名字是什么意思？你在创建完全不同的自我。这在文化中是被鼓励的。

但让我给你举一个例子，在一个领域里造成的影响是多么严重，正如我在开头提到的，那就是商业。几年前，一位正在写一本关于如何作为商界领导者保持品格的人写下了这些内容。我只是随手拿来的，但它们也非常揭示问题。他说：“不要在公开场合谈论质量标准，但在私下你有不合理的时间限制，所有员工都知道这一点。

不要带朋友去公司包厢座位，因为大家都知道你应该只带客户。不要在公开场合说一切都很顺利，而所有员工都知道实际上并不顺利。不要给管理层提供巨大的福利而不给其他人。不要在季度末前大量下订单，即使你知道这些订单最终都会被取消，但在季度的财务报表上看起来会很好。

” 当你听到这些内容时，你突然意识到，天啊，我们就在这种环境中游泳。我又回到这个比喻。别让鱼来告诉你什么是水，因为鱼根本不会知道什么是水。因为它就在水中，以至于它看不见水的存在。

也许我们已经到了一个地步，连对商界、政界、教会，乃至生活中的人，都无法简单地说要成为有诚信的人，因为他们甚至不知道什么是诚信，因为他们早已习惯了这种行为——不要做这个，不要做那个，但我们却只是在其中游弋。它无处不在，贯穿整段经文，我们应当诚实、正直和圣洁的原因都归结于神。不是吗？我们应该像神一样诚实、正直和圣洁，因为神就是这样的。

这一点对基督徒来说意味着惊人的启示。在登山宝训中有一个地方提到誓言。当你读到登山宝训时，你会发现很多内容都很有道理。但到了某个地方，你可能会觉得不太明白。

这关乎誓言的问题。耶稣说：“你们的话，是就说是，不是就说不是；若再多说，就是出于那恶者。”你会想：这是什么意思？这里的意思是，在那个时代，人们普遍认为如果以神的名起誓，那就不能违背誓言。

这可能与他们对十诫的理解有关，即不可妄称耶和华你神的名字（出埃及记20章7节），意味着一旦用神的名字起誓，就必须遵守。如果你以神的名字起誓，那你必须履行诺言。但人们认为，如果以其他东西起誓——比如父亲的坟墓、耶路撒冷城或自己的头，则情况不同。在这种情况下，即使违背誓言也不算什么。

你知道耶稣的意思吗？他不是让你相信这种说法。他说：“你们为什么不明白？”耶路撒冷是神的城市。

您的头是上帝的，因为上帝创造了您的头。您父亲的坟墓也是上帝的。祂说：难道你们没有意识到，你们每天所说的每一个‘是’和每一个‘不是’，每一句闲话都像是在发誓一样，在上帝面前立下了誓言。绝对地，一切都是真实的。

绝对地，你所说的一切都是在发誓。如果我告诉你明天有人会跟着你并录像，记录下你所做的每一件事和你说的每一句话，你会更加诚实地说话吗？你会更加小心吗？你会更注意对配偶、朋友或潜在客户说的话吗？

如果你知道这一切都被录下来并在网上公开，你会更加谨慎吗？我会这样做，你们也会这样做。然而，如果我们是基督徒，我们就是傻瓜。因为确实如此，我们会更加谨慎。

然而，耶稣基督说：难道你们没有意识到，你们受到的审查比这还要严格得多。你们每一个字都承受着远远超过几千人在网上观看的压力。站在上帝面前的是真理之神、公义之神和圣洁之神。诗篇可以深刻地影响你与上帝的关系。

即使在面对死亡这样的情况时，耶稣也依靠诗篇来应对。在提摩太和凯西·基勒的《365天灵修读经》中，《耶稣的歌》这本书里，你可以每天阅读诗篇，并获得新的圣经洞见。如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。而如果你已经花时间在研读和祷告上，那么通过诗篇来阅读和祈祷可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前，从而发现与祂更深的亲密关系。

作为您赠予福音与生命的感谢，我们将寄送一本提摩太和凯西·基勒的灵修读经。现在就访问 gospelandlife.com/slash-give 获取您的副本吧。这是 gospelandlife.com/slash-give。接下来是戴维博士。

凯勒和其他今天的教导。你看出来实践真理的问题和难度，但这并不是保罗在这里唯一提到的问题。关于真理，它不只是一个问题。还有一个第二个问题，这让我感到非常有趣。

他在第15节中暗示了这一点。他没有直接说“要说真话”，而是说“要用爱心说真话”。他不仅说要讲真话，还特别强调要在爱中讲真话。好吧，这听起来不错。

当你看到这一点时，你可能会想：好的，所以要诚实但也要加上传爱。因此，真话是一个方面，而爱是另一个方面。但是到了第29节最后一句，你会发现保罗所阐述的要点是多么惊人，因为他这样说：“不要让任何败坏的话从你们口中说出来。”这个“败坏”这个词实际上是指腐烂。

这是一个表示腐烂、导致腐化和瓦解的词。好吧。那么什么是败坏的话语呢？败坏的话语就是那些不是为了建造、没有设计来益处的话语。

你说，那是什么意思？是那些真实的但不是为了建造和益处的话。即使是真话也是腐烂的。答案是肯定的，这就是保罗的意思。

腐烂。那么什么是败坏的话语？这又意味着什么呢？一方面，你知道，在莎士比亚戏剧《亨利五世》中的一幕里，他刚刚处决了一个因抢劫而被指控的人，当时英军正在入侵法国。

在某个时刻，他对所有的士兵说：“我不会让法国人受到轻蔑或侮辱的语言。”是的，我们来这里是为了征服他们，但我们不会用轻蔑的语言对待他们。我们不会伤害他们的感情。现在这显然就是它的意思，但我相信保罗不仅仅是说那些粗暴、愤怒的语气。

当然，他确实是在说这一点：如果你以粗暴、尖酸刻薄的方式说出真理，那简直是错误的，是罪恶的。我说的是真理，但这并不重要，原因在于： 当你用粗暴的方式讲真话，用真相去“打倒”别人时，你真的在乎真相吗？你真的是为了真理而勇敢吗？不，你是为了自己。

但保罗不仅仅是在谈论那些明显带有攻击性的言语。他认为任何不是真正为了帮助和建造人的言语都不对。这真是令人惊讶。当你向某人讲真话时，你的目的是什么？

我们又回到了言辞行为理论。也许你所说的从技术上说是真的，从教义上是正确的，准确的，但你是否试图在别人眼中贬低这个人？你是否试图用真相去“打倒”他们？你是否试图惩罚他们？

你是否试图让他们处于劣势地位？你是否试图通过严厉批评他们来博取他人的掌声？保罗说这些都不对。任何人如果使用真理只是为了“打倒”他人以获得更多的权力和地位，就是在滥用真理。

你不是为了真理而勇敢，而是为了自己。你用真相来获取自己的权力和地位。到了这一点，我们意识到，我们正接近一个主要的反对意见——当今世界，特别是我们这个文化中的人对教会的一个主要反对意见。福柯、尼采等人多年来一直在说：当基督徒声称拥有真理时，他们实际上只是在利用真理来获得优势。

福柯这位法国哲学家曾说过，真理是这个世界的一部分，它是由多种形式的约束所生产出来的，并且会产生一系列权力效应。每个社会都有其自己的“真理制度”。他说，基本上来说，真理声明就是权力游戏。那么当基督徒听到这些时，他们应该怎么做呢？

根据圣经，他们应该怎么做呢？首先，他们不应该拿备用的说：“等等，确实有绝对真理。”而应该是悔改。为什么这样说呢？

在福柯、尼采和马克思之前很久，耶稣就说过这样的话。他说：“虚伪的法利赛人啊！因为你们喜爱会堂里的高位，又爱人在街上受人们的问安。你们这假冒为善的人哪！

对你们中间那些背着残疾人的，你们有意叫他从狭窄的巷子里过去吗？为什么不先去放下他的担子呢？”（马太福音23:6-7） 他在说什么呢？他在说那些利用上帝的律法、真理和圣经来获取社会中的高位，让别人受苦的人。

这正是福柯和尼采所做的事情。是的，耶稣基督多年前就用福音拆除了保罗所说的，并且拆除了世界上许多不喜欢基督教的人抱怨的东西。如果你的价值感来自上帝的恩典，如果你知道你有价值的原因只是因为上帝的爱与恩典，那么上帝的真理对你来说就是一种喜悦，是你所喜爱的事物。所以，如果你的价值感来自于上帝的恩典，你就爱真理。

但是，如果你的价值感来自于正确，如果你的价值和重要性来自于拥有真理并准确地表述它，而不是来自上帝，你就会认为真理可以给你只有上帝才能给你的那种感觉——因为你对真理了解得非常透彻，因此必须是一个有价值的重要人物。耶稣多年前就称这种行为为伪善、法利赛主义，并拆除了它。所以，基督徒在某种程度上站在一条非常狭窄的地基上。事实上，在这里你看到的是那些基本上说：“谁来定义什么是真理？

什么是真相？”的人。你知道每个人都要自己决定什么是真理。他们要么否认有真理，要么随意篡改真理。

另一方面，有人认为确实有真理，并且宣称**这是绝对的真理**，然后用这种真理去教训别人。耶稣说保罗也说过这两种态度都不好。如果你是一个有诚信的人，你不会采取任何一种方式。那些用真理去教训别人的并不是真正为了真理，而是为了自己。

你知道那些非基督徒的思想家们看得清清楚楚。所以这就是两个问题：一方面我们害怕讲真话，知道一直讲真话有多难；另一方面保持承诺和许诺也很困难，坚持诚信更是如此，这让人感到恐惧。确实很可怕。如果我总是说实话，那别人就不会对我有误解了，但这种恐惧让我们撒谎。

我一直都在撒谎，就是因为害怕。而另一方面是骄傲。聪明的路德说过，基督徒就像一个醉汉从马上摔下来后立刻又跳上另一匹马，结果还是摔倒。我们现在被夹在两种文化之间。

听我说，我们确实有一个问题：我们的文化是相对主义的。他们真的这么说：“谁能说什么是真理呢？”“没有人能说清什么是对错。”所有关于真理和道德的东西都是文化相对的。

现在其中一个糟糕的问题是我们对这种观点感到愤怒，这几乎成了笑话。我们告诉孩子们没有对错之分，你们自己决定吧，然后真理不存在；但当他们进入社会开始撒谎、作弊时，我们就大为光火。C.S.刘易斯在他的《人之废除》中这样写道： 我们在要求那些正是我们正在剥夺的东西。我们嘲笑荣誉，嘲笑真话的概念，嘲笑荣誉却对身边出现的商人感到震惊。

阉割自己，却祈求他们多生几个孩子。他说的就是这个意思。他说我们告诉孩子们全部的真相，而道德是相对的。谁来定义什么是真相呢？

然后它又说我们要追求那些我们正在使之不可能拥有的品质。看看这所有的腐败。看看这些人是如何作弊的。看看这些人是如何不诚实的。

真相是相对的，但你为什么就不诚实？我们追求的正是我们自己正在使之不可能拥有的品质。我们嘲笑荣誉，却对在我们中间的商人感到震惊。我们羞辱他们，然后又为他们的美德镀上金粉，希望他们能结出果实、培养美德和诚实与正直，但他们做不到。

一方面我们在这样的社会中生活，但因此带来的危险是，我们会变成那些使用不健康言语的人——不是用真理来建造，而是用来伤害。我们知道我们攻击的是问题本身，而不是人。所以我们有了“真理派”。我们有真理，没有其他人。

然后我们有了“爱派”。啊，这不过是接受所有人而已。但问题是：没有爱的真理并不是**真正的真理，而只是**权力的攫取；没有真理的爱也不是**真正的爱。这是**懦弱或智力上的懒惰。

真理和爱必须在一起，否则它们就不是自己本身了。明白了吗？这就是保罗在这里所说的。没有爱的真理不是真理，没有真理的爱也不是爱。

除非两者结合在一起，否则它们都不是完整的。那么我们该怎么办呢？这里是我们要做的事情。在约翰福音第18章中，我最近注意到这实际上有两个审判。

耶稣首先被带到大祭司面前，在他受难之前，他被带到大祭司和那些宗教领袖面前；然后在同一章节中，他又被带到彼拉多面前。当他在大祭司面前时，他说了什么？他作证说真理，但他们却打了他。但当他站在彼拉多面前时，几乎用同样的话又说了：“我作证的是真理。

”你知道彼拉多说什么了吗？“什么是真理？”然后他们就杀了他。我希望你们能见证这个奇迹。

首先，我要见证耶稣基督的正直。耶稣基督，多么正直的人啊！为什么？他在这两个地方都是一样的。

耶稣没有虚伪，他在一个地方和另一个地方都是同样的人。这里就是那些自命不凡的人吧？那些他曾谴责的假宗教领袖们。这里就是他们了。

他说的话是一样的。这里就是相对主义者。什么是真理，犹大说。而他在这里也是同样地表达。

耶稣不是两种不同的人。请注意这一点。他不仅在这两个地方都一样，而且他们都恨他。他们都打他。

他们都杀他。为什么？因为这里有个奇怪的地方。相对主义者和自命不凡的人都追求权力。

相对主义者说谁来定义什么是真理是为了获得权力。而自命不凡者说他们拥有真理也是为了获得权力。但耶稣基督恰恰相反，他站在绝对的正直上。我为真理作见证。

他说的话是一样的，却因此被杀。为什么？因为他用真理来为我们服务。他们用真理来控制我们。

他的正直使他上了十字架。但他为什么要上十字架？这里有个答案。我可以问你们一个问题吗？

耶稣基督是为真理而上十字架的吗？他去十字架是为了证明上帝的律法不可违背吗？为了展示上帝的圣洁和公义必须得到满足吗？耶稣基督是为真理而去十字架吗？

还是说，耶稣基督是为爱而去十字架，好让我们因罪得赦免、被饶恕，在我们的罪中被接纳？各位朋友，耶稣基督是为真理去的十字架，还是为爱去的十字架？答案是两者兼有。他一死，上帝的真理就得到了无限的满足，因为他完成了上帝爱的要求。

但当他死的时候，上帝的爱也得到了无限的满足，因为现在他可以拥抱我们、饶恕我们、赦免我们，并接纳我们。十字架将真理和爱结合在了一起。我知道在世界上，有时在生活中，它们似乎是对立的。但说实话，我不确定那是爱的表现，还是说它们在十字架上并没有对立，而当十字架成为你生命中心时，也不会再对立了。

你知道为什么吗？它让你摆脱了那种因恐惧而变得虚伪、失去真相的恐惧——因为耶稣基督如此爱你，以至于为你舍命；同时，它也让你摆脱了那种因骄傲而滥用真相的自满——因为耶稣基督必须为你受死。你本是那么罪恶。所以，那种会滥用真相的骄傲被十字架带走了。

那种让我们逃避、躲避、玩弄真相的恐惧也被带走了。我们的心充满了爱，这里是我们能做的事情：29节，我知道翻译成“只说那些对听者有益的话”很好，但希腊文原意是“只说那些会给听者带来恩典的话”。当你从耶稣基督的十字架中得到恩典时，你才能温柔地讲出真理。或者用另一种方式来说，就像先生 Incredible 说过的一样，“我有时间。

” 让我再告诉你一件事，在历史的开端，不要想太多。在人类历史的开始，那是一个灾难。亚当和夏娃，你知道，在伊甸园里发生了什么？罪、蛇，你了解那个故事。

一切都是那么糟糕——死亡、毁灭、邪恶，一切都糟糕透了，除了有一个希望的光芒。你知道是什么吗？它是一个诺言。创世记3:15，神说：“我会赐福给亚当夏娃的后裔，有一天他的后代会踩踏蛇的头，摧毁邪恶。

” 我承诺。几个世纪后，神开始对亚伯拉罕说话，说他会通过你的后裔拯救世界。一天晚上，亚伯拉罕问：但我怎么能确定呢？在创世记15章，上帝向亚伯拉罕显现，并且通过穿过一只死动物的碎片来震惊他，也震惊了任何理解创世记15的人。

他说：“我会通过你的后裔拯救世界，即使**这意味着我自己必须牺牲。**”这是第二个应许。多年后，耶稣基督来到这个世界，他是完全正直的人，完全正直。他总是说到做到，说到什么就做什么，绝对的正直。

但在最终的最伟大的行为中，为了履行他的承诺，他坚定地走向耶路撒冷，走向十字架。为什么？因为他要履行上帝的诺言。在他面前的一切都倒下了。

一切都在反对他。地狱本身也下来了，但他却说：“不，我已经许下诺言。”然后他走向十字架，为我们的罪而死。你们已经被耶稣基督的正直拯救了。

你们已经被耶稣基督守信的行为拯救了。这应该使我们谦卑，不再用真理来伤害别人，但另一方面，它也让我们确信有一个真理是我们无法改变的。因此，不要害怕讲真话。哦，朋友们，请看看耶稣的正直，看看他在十字架上为你所做的一切，成为有正直的人。

让我们祷告。感谢你，父亲，赐给我们关于耶稣基督的视野，他守住了所有的诺言。他是完全正直的人。他用真理来拯救我们，而不是利用我们。

我们的父啊，当我们否认真理或未能说出真相以拯救他人，或者滥用真理以获得权力和地位时，我们就把目光从你的儿子身上移开了。他就是道路、真理和生命，但在十字架上，他给了我们一个关于真理与爱如何结合在一起的永恒视野——它们是不可分割的一体。求你让我们看到耶稣在十字架上的作为，使真理和爱在我们的生活中手牵手地成长。阿门。

我们祈求你能帮助我们在当前这个不愿意听真话的文化中知道如何讲出真理。主啊，我们祈求你能帮助我们明白**我们需要成为什么样的人——有诚信的人。**我们以上帝耶稣基督的名向你祷告，阿门。感谢您今天聆听我们的教导。
