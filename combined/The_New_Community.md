# The New Community / The New Community

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to the Gospel and Life podcast. Today, Tim Keller is teaching on perhaps the most well-known sermon ever preached, the sermon on the Mount. In it, we'll find Jesus' invitation to a radical new kind of life that is far beyond a guide to morality.

Turn your bulletins to the passage from the sermon on the Mount. We'll look at tonight. Now, the sermon on the Mount is not something that we should be reading as if it's an individual, a guide for an individual, a guide simply for how I, as an individual, should live my life.

The sermon on the Mount is really a description of a new kind of community. That's the reason why John Stott, who's a great Bible commentator, very well-known, when he wrote his commentary on the sermon on the Mount, he called it the Christian counterculture. Because this is really describing a body of people, it's describing a community.

But what's so interesting is that even though that theme, the theme of Christian community, Christian fellowship, of deep Christian relationships, even though that theme is all through the sermon on the Mount, there's no one section where Jesus sort of lays out how a relationship with him radically changes our relationships with other Christians. How it forms a new, deep, radical human community in Christ. He doesn't actually lay it out in any one place.

It's through everything else. So in order for me to do what I want to do tonight, which is to say what Jesus tells us about this new human community that his gospel creates between believers. In order to talk about that, I have to pull these pieces out.

So let's read these pieces and string them along like a string of pearls on a string. This is what we're going to read, Matthew 5, starting at 21. You've heard that it was said to the people long ago.

Do not murder. And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment.

Again, anyone who says to his brother, Raka, is answerable to the Sanhedrin. Anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell. Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar, and they are remembered that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar.

First go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift. He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?

Are not even the tax collectors doing that. And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that.

Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. Do not judge. Or you too will be judged.

For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged. And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the spec of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

How can you say to your brother, let me take the spec out of your eye when all the time there's a plank in your own eye. You hip a crit, first take the plank out of your own eye, then you will see clearly remove the spec from your brother's eye. Do not give dogs what is sacred.

Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces. Let's end our reading right there.

What does Jesus teach us about this radical new community that is formed by his gospel message when it comes into your life? How does it create this new community between those who believe in Jesus? Here's what he teaches us in this passage.

Five things. Five things. It's a liberal arts major.

Five things. First of all, he teaches us the necessity of this new community. You can't be a Christian without entering a new community.

The way he gets this across, this is something that you're over going to overlook unless you bring it out and look at it. What does he call other Christians? What do we call them?

What are they? Over and over and over again, in verse 21 to 23, four times, five times, he says, brother. Do not murder.

But I tell you, anyone who's angry with his brother, anyone who says it was brother. Anyone, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother, then down in chapter 7, those verses. Why do you look at the spec of sawdust in your brother's eye?

Hypocritic, the plank out of your eye, then you'll be able to clearly remove the spec from your brother's eye. Eight, seven, eight times. Now, this is pretty obvious, but let me help you, let us sink in.

The people that you automatically get related to when you're born into a family are not friends. You choose your friends, not lovers. You choose your lovers, relatives.

You don't choose your relatives. And they're not, look at your relatives. These aren't people you would have chosen.

Look at your siblings. Your brothers and sisters, they come automatically. You don't want to be an orphan.

No, no. You'd like to have parents who wouldn't want to have parents. The trouble with getting parents.

You don't want to be an orphan. You get parents. If you get parents, you automatically get family.

You automatically get relatives. You automatically get brothers and sisters. And they're not like friends or lovers.

Those are people you choose. Those are volunteer relationships. Family relationships are with people that you don't particularly like.

And yet you just really know way to get away from them. They're there. And you have obligations.

And you've got to see them. And you've got to deal with them. And you've got to deal with them.

And Jesus has the audacity to use that terminology to describe other Christians to you. Well, let's put it another way. When you enter into a relationship with the Father through Jesus.

The whole point of Christianity is he is not a boss. You're not working for a boss. So as long as you're producing, you have a job.

But if you stop producing, you're fired. He's a father. That means you have an enduring and unconditional and unmerited relationship.

But what that means is, unlike your friends, you enter into a relationship with a friend, because, hey, I think I can get something out of this relationship. I like you. You like me.

Let's do things together. We have common interests. That's friends.

Or you fall in love. Wow. You're attracted to you.

You're attracted to me. And so on. Those are actually conditional relationships.

But family is unconditional. Jesus says, if you want an unconditional relationship with your Father, you're going to get unconditional relationships with brothers and sisters. You're going to have people around you.

Christians who now are family. And you have got to treat them as family. You have an obligation to them.

It's not a voluntary relationship. I know. I'm putting this in the most negative possible way.

Why not? Because it's part of what it means. Basically, you can turn them into friends.

You ought to try. In fact, we're going to spend the rest of the time talking about how you do. You want to turn your brothers and sisters into friends.

In some cases, you would like to marry a brother or sister, hopefully. You would like to turn at least one of them into a lover and into a spouse. But the fact is, they all start out there at least brothers and sisters.

And that means you have got an unconditional relationship with them. They're yours. Whether you like them or not.

And in many, many cases, in fact, in most cases, you won't. You won't like them. Just like you don't like your own relatives so many of them.

And that's what Jesus is saying. In C. S.

Lewis's Narnia Chronicles, there's a place when Aslan the Great Lion, who's the Christ figure, he's been resurrected. Or it's just like Jesus. And then he bends down to his two girls, Susan and Lucy.

And he says, and now, said Aslan, to business, we have a long journey and you must ride on me. And he crashed down and the children climbed onto his warm golden back and Susan sat first holding on tightly to his main and Lucy sat behind holding tightly to Susan. And with a great heavey rose underneath them and shot off faster than any horse can go.

Now, this is very interesting. If you read the story and if you know, and some of you do, not most of you, but some of you do, if you know something about the characters, it's very interesting how the author, C. S.

Lewis, depicted the post-resurrection church and their relationship to the Lord. Because that's what he's showing. Susan, of all the children in the book, Susan is the weak one.

She's the spiritually weak one. She's obtuse. She's cruel to Lucy.

She never gets it. She's kind of stupid, spiritually speaking. But Lucy is the true heart.

Lucy is the dear heart. Lucy is the one with the deepest spiritual sight. Lucy is the one with the best relationship with Aslan.

But C. S. Lewis puts Lucy up on Aslan's back and the only way she can hold on to Aslan is to hold on to Susan.

And this is exactly what the Bible says. If you want to have a relationship with Jesus, if you want to be related to him in mission, Aslan says, we've got places to go. I've got things to do.

You've got to hold on to me. But the only way he will let you hold on to him is if you're willing to hold on to Susan, to brothers and sisters that you don't like. Lucy, when you read the book, if you do read the book, you identify with her.

And you say, if anybody deserves to be able to get on Aslan's back and be an individual practicing mystic, it would be her. She gets up there, she holds on to the main, personal contact. I don't need anybody else.

And you see, typically Americans today say, I want to be spiritual, but I don't want to be religious. And what they usually mean by that is I want to have a personal experience of divine reality, but I don't want to have to deal with other people. I don't want to have to join an institution.

I don't want to have to be part of a body. And the God of the Bible says, I don't work like that. You're going to have to make up another God.

The only way you can hold on to me is if you hold on to Susan, to hold on to brothers, to hold on to sisters, people that you wouldn't really have chosen to be friends. But because they are related to me, now you have to be related to them. You have to hold on to them.

You have to love them. You have to know them. And the question, can I get personal with you?

You've got, there are people around you who are Christians, your brothers and sisters. And you're making, you know, they're not your friends, but they are your brothers and sisters. Are you putting up with them?

Are you dealing with them? Are you trying to turn them into friends? Now, that's the first thing Jesus talks about, the necessity of a new community.

He doesn't work in your life as an individual. He only works in your life corporately. Secondly, he not only talks about the necessity of Christian community, he talks about the intensity.

See, clearly you're supposed to have deep relationships. Okay, somebody says, how deep? How deep do they have to go?

Well, he tells us in verse 23. He tells us how intense. Therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, first go and be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift.

Now, there are two standards in his, in his little verse. Jesus is telling us here just how deeply involved you've got to be with other Christians. You have to be involved to the place of personal accountability and corporate spirituality.

Personal accountability, corporate spirituality. What do we mean? Well, first of all, personal accountability.

Look, therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and you remember your brother has something against you, leave, go, get reconciled. Now, this is really weird. Listen carefully.

It doesn't say if you've got something against your brother. It doesn't even say if you've done something against your brother. See, look carefully.

This person, whoever this is, this brother, has a grievance against you, but you don't have a grievance against him. Now, if that person has a grievance against you, shouldn't he come to you? Yes.

He hasn't. Why not? Now, if this person's got a grievance against you and he hasn't come to you, that means either he's a coward or it means he's over-sensitive and he's really making things up and he's too upset and he's overly resentful.

In other words, this guy is at fault. If this was a voluntary relationship, there'd be no reason for you to go to that. I mean, it's up to him.

If he's got a problem with me, I should come to me, okay. Jesus holds you responsible inside the family of God that whether that person is worthy of it, whether that person's being stupid or smart, whether you've actually done something wrong or not, you are responsible to go. Why?

You're accountable. You're accountable for that person's spiritual growth and that person's accountable for yours. The Bible says that that's the difference.

That's the difference. Friendship is an informal, voluntary kind of mutual relationship but your brothers and sisters, family, you are accountable to each other. In Hebrews chapter 3, verse 13, it says, exhort one another daily, lest you're hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

Now that's very interesting. Hardened. The Bible says, sin is like frigid air and your heart is like a bucket of water.

If you are going camping in the winter, you know that you've got to always be breaking the ice on the top of the bucket of water because it just forms there naturally. And if you don't keep breaking it, next thing you know you'll turn around and you'll be looking for something to drink or to cook with and it will be frozen solid. Now the Bible says that your heart is like that.

That it's automatically getting proud or it's getting either hard through pride or hard through sadness. If things are going well in your life, it's getting hard through proudness. Poorly in your life, it's getting hard through sadness, but it's going hard.

It's always getting hard. Naturally, it's as water on a cold day. And what does the Hebrews 3, 13 say?

Is the only way you're going to avoid freezing. And the answer is you've got to have some people in your life who know you well enough to be able to talk to you about your pride and talk to you about your sadness and talk to you about your problems and talk to you about your character flaws. And not only do you have to have people who know you're that open with, you've also got to have people that you have that much contact with.

This is one of the issues, a big issue. If you're a Christian and you live in this day and age, you're a mobile. You're a mobile and your friends are a mobileist.

Especially if you live in New York. You're always saying goodbye to friends. And you know what that means?

And they're saying goodbye to you and they're moving around. You know what that means? That means you do have people in the world that you're open enough with for them to be breaking the ice over your heart.

But usually you don't have anybody nearby. I mean, it takes tremendous work to be constantly getting open enough with the people who know you, the people who really live near you and the people that you are seeing enough so that they can hold you accountable. But you've got to be deeply involved enough so that there's personal accountability between you and other people.

Who does know about you? Who have you given the green light to blow the whistle on you? Who are you opening up?

Fairly regularly about everything. About your prayer life. About how you use your money.

About your sex life. About your thought life. About your...

Who? If you have nobody... Jesus holds...

Jesus says, I insist you have people that you're that accountable for and that you're that accountable too who are always breaking the ice over your heart. Who are they? Do you have them?

So first of all, he's saying you've got to have relationships that are deep to the place of personal accountability. Superficial fellowship. Saying hi to everybody, hugging and kissing at church is not enough.

Secondly, you also, he's showing us here, you have to also have deep relationships to the point not just of personal accountability but of corporate spirituality, what do I mean? Well, look at the verse again. What's the problem?

You need to go get your brother and bring him to the altar. Your brother's not there. See, the issue is, don't worship alone.

You must not worship alone. Now, this simply doesn't mean... It doesn't mean, well, I want to go to a big church where there's 1500 people there and that's more spiritual than a small church.

That's not what we're talking about. Here's what we're talking about. The Bible says, in this place, that only as a temple, you know, it says in 1 Peter and also in Ephesians 2, it says, as a temple, we are living stones in a temple, inhabited by the Spirit of God.

You know that image? Well, that's not just a beautiful image. It's beautiful.

We are stones were built together, we're cemented in together, and the Lord inhabits us. It's only together that we're inhabited. C.

S. Lewis says in his book, The Four Loves. By the way, I'm using all C.

S. Lewis illustrations tonight. Anybody notice?

C. S. Lewis says that when he was a circle, he was a member of a circle of three people, three friends.

Jack, Ronald, he's Jack. Jack, Ronald, and Charles. And when Charles died, he thought he'd have more of Ronald.

But what he said, and I'll read it. To his shock, he found he had less of Ronald. That's what he says.

He says in each of my friends, there's something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity. By myself, I am not large enough to call the whole person into activity.

Now that Charles is dead, I'll never see Ronald's reaction to his humor. Far from having more of Ronald, now that Charles is gone, I have less. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city-catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds.

This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you.

The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin D. Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city-catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city-catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world.

So, request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now, here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now, why did Louis bring that up? If that's true of a human being, if it's true that you really can't know somebody. Now, you know this, by the way, when you're married to somebody, you think you know them.

One-on-one. And in a way, you do. You know them better than anybody else.

But you still all, one-on-one. One of the things that is kind of interesting is very often you think you know your spouse pretty well. And a new person comes into your life.

A new friend, a new somebody. And that new person brings something out in your spouse that you've never seen before. Even if you've been with her for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, amazing.

Why? Here's the principle. As an individual, you are insufficient to draw the entire person into activity.

You cannot bring it all out. It's only in a group that you can know an individual well. And if that's true of human beings, what about God Himself?

It means that if you know two or three Christians, really, in a middle, you're not going to know God very well. If you know more Christians, the more Christians know in a middle, the more of God you're going to know because they see a part of God that only they see. They bring out something in God that only they can bring out.

And as a result, unless you're praying with people, unless you're worshiping with people, unless you've got people that you can talk to about your Christianity, talk to about your feelings about God, talk to about what your struggles and wrestling with God. If you don't have people you're wrestling and praying and praising God with, you don't really know Him very well. Jesus says, go get your brother.

I don't want you to be at the altar by yourself. Go get your sister. I don't want you at the altar by yourself.

That's the necessity of this new community and that's the intensity. This new community. Thirdly, we're told about the symmetry of this new community.

Now, here's what I think. Symmetry, you say, yeah. How do you get these relationships this deep?

How do you get them down that deep? And Jesus says the key is treating people with a balance. And it's a balance of truth and love, basically.

But look at the way He puts it. It's down here at the bottom, chapter 7. Do not judge or you too will be judged.

For in the same way you judge others, you'll be judged. Okay, now that's interesting. Don't be judgmental, right?

Don't condemn. That sounds great. But then look down to verse 6.

Do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet and turn interior pieces.

Well, verse 1. In verse 1, He's saying, don't condemn people. Don't be judgmental.

In verse 6, He's calling people pigs and dogs. And now, you know what? If you think that's a contradiction, you don't understand the balance.

And almost nobody does. I mean, I don't. And really nobody but Jesus had this.

Over and over and over again over the Bible says, love without truth. If you just say, oh, I don't want to tell anybody with the truth. I don't want to tell anybody that they're wrong.

I don't want to confront. I don't want to challenge. Who am I to say they're wrong?

If you have relationships like that, we're always saying, who am I to say they're wrong? That's love without truth and that's not really love. You say, I don't want to be judgmental.

But you never are willing to say this person's being a pig. This person's being a dog. This person's being stupid.

This person's being spiritually obtuse. If you never are willing to challenge, if you love without truth, it's not really love. It's idolatry.

It's self-indulgence. It's cowardice. Because you're not giving them what they need.

If you love them without truth, you're not really loving them. You're not really loving them. You're loving yourself.

You coward. You're loving yourself. You don't want that person to ever go away.

You're too dependent on them. And therefore, if you're too dependent on them, you're not really loving them. You're loving yourself through them.

You're using them. But on the other hand, on the other hand, truth without love, condemning people, writing them off, holding them to standards and then saying, you're not living up to standards. Truth without love is not really truth.

You know why? Because it tells people that God's not about grace. Truth without love is actually a falsehood.

Verse 6 has been used over the years, quite people this way. People have read verse 6 and they say, well, clearly the pearls and the holy things, the sacred things, are the things of God, the truth, the gospel, the things of the kingdom. And clearly what this is saying is, don't give people that which they can't appreciate.

Don't give to people who don't believe the gospel. Don't tell them about it. Don't give to people who can't appreciate it and who are unworthy of it.

Don't take the truth to them. They'll just trample it under feet. Have you ever heard it preached that way?

Have you ever heard it discussed that way? Actually, I have to admit that in the long ago, I found a sermon that I preached on this in 1977, hopefully that I can, which I said that. I said, this verse means that you must not take the truth to people who can't appreciate it.

There's a small problem with that. I was reading a book by Dallas Willard called the Divine Conspiracy, which is a new book and it's a meditation on the sermon on the mount. And he says, if this means that you shouldn't give truth to people who can't appreciate it, then why in the world did Jesus ever come?

I mean, you know, Jesus, if you say, this is, don't give the truth to people who can't appreciate it and aren't worthy of it. Well, Jesus could have saved himself a trip then. I mean, there's nobody down here who appreciates it.

There's nobody down here who's worthy of it. And by the way, it almost, if that's the way you understand verse six, then Jesus didn't take his own advice because he came down. He told people about the truth who didn't appreciate it and they didn't turn upon him and they tore him to pieces.

However, that's not what it's saying. Dallas Willard does a very good job in which he says, it's not saying pigs and dogs are not people who can't appreciate the truth. They're people who can't digest the truth.

When it says, throw, what do you throw to pigs? You throw them food. And what he's saying is, he says, and I think he's absolutely right, he says, when you give people the truth in such a way, here's a pig, very, very hungry, and you're throwing pearls.

And the pig bites down and it hurts. And it swallows and chokes. Eventually he says, Dallas Willard says, the pigs are going to turn on you.

Why? Because at least you're edible. And what he means is this is saying, love without truth is not love, but truth without love.

Truth where you take the truth and you push it on people, you force it on people or you demand that they get it or understand it or journey through it or process it the way you did. In the one of C. S.

Lewis's non-eachronicals called the horse and his boy, there's two characters, one is named Shasta and one is named Aravus. Shasta's a boy Aravus is the girl. One point they're traveling along and a lion appears and with his huge claws he scratches Aravus across the back and it hurts and it draws blood but then he disappears.

Later in the book, Shasta meets Aslan, the lion, and Aslan is the Christ figure. And Shasta says, are you the lion that's scratched and wounded Aravus? And Aslan says, yes I am.

Just Shasta says, why in the world did you do that? You're this great king, you're this good person, you know, you're this great and glorious savior. Why did you do that?

And this is what he says. He turns to him and says, child, he says, I'm telling you your story, not hers. I tell no one any story but his own.

Now C. S. Lewis got that right out of the Bible, right out of the end of the book of John, where St.

Peter asked about John the Apostle, says, Lord, what's going to happen to him? And Jesus says, I don't tell anybody their other story. I only tell you your story.

Now what does that mean? This is the reason why Christians don't keep this balance. I'm afraid.

Christian, you've got to speak the truth. You've got to confront people but you must be very, very careful. You only know your own story.

You don't completely know anybody else's story. You don't know what they deserve. You don't know what God's doing in their life completely.

You cannot see their whole journey. You must not prescribe your experiences if it has to be their experience. You must not push otherwise you're turning them into pigs.

I mean, the idea behind the verse is really that you deserve to be eaten and they will turn on you and they will bite you because you're saying it's got to be done this way and it's got to be done in this order and you've got to accept this. No, no, no, no, no. Love without truth is not really love but truth of that love is not really truth.

There needs to be humility before the greatness of the soul in front of you, humility before the greatness of Christ being formed in that person. Unless you've got that, if you don't see the greatness of what God's doing in the life of another Christian, if you don't realize it's there, you're either going to love and not tell the truth. But Jesus says, no, if that person is something's wrong, verse 23, go to him, reconcile with him, figure it out.

Go, go, don't you dare be silent. Don't you dare, can't be a coward. But on the other hand, don't you dare think you know exactly what that person has to do and how that person has to jump through the hoops.

Oh no, there has to be a symmetry, a balance in your life between truth and love. Now somebody's, I know what somebody's saying. Somebody's saying, well, how do I know if I'm unbalanced in my attitude toward other people in my other Christian?

How do I know if my relationships are unbalanced? Oh, assume it. Assume that you're on, you are.

In our temperament, our natural temperament without the Holy Spirit, you're either going to be a truth type or a love type. You're either going to be a nice person, diplomatic and sweet, but basically a coward, or you're going to be a challenge, fourth right, direct person, but basically cruel, basically unfeeling. We're going to be one of the other.

And the only way to get that symmetry so that your relationships get down into the depths unto personal accountability and corporate spirituality is if you read about Jesus and how he treated people, read it over and over and over and over and over again. Now, lastly, that's the necessity, that's the intensity, that's the symmetry, but what's the causality? What is it that actually causes these kinds of relationships?

Now, it's really pretty subtle, but let me just suggest when Jesus says judge not, don't be judgmental or you'll be judged. You know what the word judge is here? It's the word condemn.

It's not the word evaluate. He's not saying evaluate not. You have to evaluate.

Otherwise, you can't tell the truth. Otherwise, you can't know what somebody needs. He says, don't condemn, but the word condemn is the same word as in Romans 8 verse 1.

Now, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. If you know that Jesus Christ was judged, if you know Jesus Christ took the condemnation, all of it, that creates an energy in you so that the judgmentalism is just drained right out of you. And that brings these symmetry.

And only that brings the symmetry. Let me close this way. Let me be real practical.

Let me say something to three kinds of people. If you're not sure you're a Christian, you're not sure what you believe, if you're kind of in spiritual process, get a friend, a good friend who is a Christian that you respect, you'll never, ever, probably, it's very rare, I should say, not ever, ever. It is very unlikely you're going to process the gospel and the information about Jesus Christ on your own.

God doesn't work that way. He works through people. Isn't that good?

You know, don't say, oh my word, that's good. Isn't that the big problem in the world? Go, if you read the gospel narrative, you'll see John the Baptist tells Andrew about Jesus.

And he meets Jesus. Andrew tells Philip about Jesus. And he meets Jesus.

Philip goes and tells Nathaniel about Jesus. And he meets Jesus. None of these people get there on their own.

If you're trying to figure out where you are spiritually and what you believe, and you're trying to do it all by yourself reading books coming to Redeemer, I don't care if you're inspired by the music or the sermons. I don't care. You're going to get bored or you're going to get confused unless you got a friend to process it with.

Secondly, Christian friends, how do you get personal accountability and corporate spirituality by coming to a worship service? By coming to worship service every single week? By volunteering or something?

Even? No, only in a small group. Either a small group you put together or a small group that you go to that's already made.

Unless you have a small group of Christians who are praying together and holding each other accountable, you cannot obey what Jesus Christ calls you to. Lastly, one more CSList reference. There's six tonight.

Lewis wrote a book called Mayor Christianity some years ago. Actually, it was a series of radio talks. It's basically about, he says, I'm not going to talk about Greek orthodoxy or Roman Catholicism or Presbyterianism or Baptist.

I'm going to talk about general mayor Christianity. A lot of people love that because isn't that what we want? Instead of getting into denominations and differences, don't we just want to be Christians?

Of course we do. And yet, he wrote a major warning at the beginning of his book. And he said this, he says, I hope no reader will think Mayor Christianity has put forth here as an alternative to existing churches.

As if you could adopt Christianity in preference to congregationalism or Presbyterianism or Anglicanism or Greek orthodoxy. What I'm writing is more like a hall out of which doors open into several rooms. If I can bring anyone into the hallway, I shall have done what I attempted, but it is in the rooms not in the hall where there are fires and chairs and meals.

Now hear this, because I know this is true of a lot of people. We want to be Mayor Christians. We hate the scandal of particularity.

What Lewis is saying is we all want to just be Christians in general. But if you're actually, he says, Christianity itself, this idea of Christianity is an abstraction. If you really want meals, if you really want fires, if you really want chairs, if you really want rest, if you really want growth, you've got to get into a real church, you've got to get into a church where people are accountable to each other.

You've got to get into a church where there's covenants, where there's accountability. And that means it's going to be a particular kind of church. It's going to be a Baptist church or it's going to be a Presbyterian church.

Even it's going to be an Anglican church or agree with the words of our church. Now I know you've got church to say, we're not denominational. Well, that's congregationalism.

I mean, that's the denomination of churches that insist they're not a denomination. There's always been there. You're never going to be able to actually grow in grace unless you get into a real church and that church is going to have positions you don't like.

I don't like the way they baptize. I don't like this or that about the way they do this. The scandal of particularity, you're never going to find a church that's just right.

But a lot of you are still in the hallway. You stay in the hallway. You flip around.

You go from church to church or you go to no church. You're a mere Christian, but see as Lewis says, it's only in the rooms. It's only in the real particular churches with all their warts and all their specifics and all their particularities that there's meals and fire and chairs.

That's the reason why you're not growing. You've got to get involved in something. You've got to put your feet down in a particular church.

See, Jesus Christ says, you're in a family admitted. That's pray. We thank you, Father, for granting to us a family.

Oh, we want family until we actually get it. We want brothers and sisters. It sounds so wonderful until we actually see them.

Brothers and sisters are not ones that we've chosen. They're not friends. They're not lovers.

They're brothers and sisters. And, Lord, there's a lot of people in our lives around us that we're not taking seriously as brothers and sisters. We pray that you would help us to admit and accept our brothers and sisters and turn them more and more into friends and fellow worshipers.

People that we know and love and hold tight to because we know the more we hold tight to them, the more we'll hold tight to your son. It's in his name that we pray. Amen.

欢迎来到《福音与生活》播客。今天，蒂姆·凯勒将为我们讲解有史以来最著名的讲道之一——登山宝训。在这段讲道中，我们将找到耶稣对一种超越道德指导的全新生活方式的邀请。听完今天的教诲后，请访问 gospelandlife.com 并订阅邮件更新。

当你订阅时，你将收到我们的季度期刊和其他宝贵的福音中心资源。你可以今天就去 gospelandlife.com 订阅。请翻到讲道宝训中的经文。今晚我们将讨论这一段。

但需要注意的是，《登山宝训》并不是用来作为个人指南或单独指导我如何生活的。《登山宝训》实际上描述了一种新的社区形态。这就是为什么约翰·斯托得，这位伟大的圣经注释家，在他的《登山宝训》注释中将其称为“基督教反文化”的原因。但有趣的是，尽管这一主题——基督教社群、基督徒团契以及深厚的基督徒关系——贯穿整个《登山宝训》，却没有一个部分明确阐述耶稣与我们之间的关系如何彻底改变与其他信徒的关系。

他并没有在一个地方详细说明这一点。而是通过其他一切内容来体现。因此，为了今晚我想做的，即解释耶稣关于信徒之间新的人类社群的教导，我必须把这些碎片串联起来。让我们阅读这些段落，并像珍珠串在绳子上一样将它们连接起来。

我们将读马太福音5章21节开始的内容：“你们听见有话说：‘人若休妻，就当为她写休书。’” 再次，对弟兄说“拉加”的人要受会堂的审问；称呼人作「愚昧」的人，就要下地狱火中。所以你奉礼物到祭坛去献时，若想起有得罪你的弟兄，就把礼物留在祭坛前。先去和弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。

祂使恶人和善人一同降雨，赐福给义人和不义的人。如果你爱那些爱你的人，有什么报答呢？连税吏也这样做啊！并且你只向你的弟兄问安，那又怎样？

难道外邦人不做吗？所以你们要完全，像你们的天父是完全的。不要论断别人。否则你也必被论断。

因为你们怎么论断人，也要怎样受人的论断；用什么量器量给人，也要用什么量器量给你们。你为什么看见你弟兄眼中的木屑，却看不见自己眼中的大梁呢？你怎么能对你的弟兄说：让我把你眼中的木屑取出来，而你自己眼中还有大梁呢？先把自己眼中的大梁去掉，然后才能清楚地把弟兄眼中的木屑取出来。

不要给狗圣物。也不要将珍珠丢在猪前，恐怕它践踏了珍珠，转过来咬你。我们读到这里就停下来吧。当耶稣的信息进入你的生活时，形成了一个怎样的新社区？

这个新社区是如何在那些相信耶稣的人之间建立起来的？这里耶稣教给我们五件事： 五件事情。五件事情。就像一个文科生。

第一，他教导我们必须有这样一个新的社区。没有进入这个新社区，就不能成为基督徒。他强调这一点的方式是如此强烈，你如果不特别注意，就会忽略它。耶稣称其他信徒为“弟兄”。

他们是谁？一遍又一遍，在第21至23节中，他提到了四次、五次：弟兄。不要杀人。但我要告诉你们，无论是对兄弟有怒气的，或是称呼人是“兄弟”的。

因此，如果你在祭坛上献礼物时，想起你的兄弟，就下来，先解决好与兄弟之间的矛盾，参见七章那些经文。假冒为善的人啊！你先把眼中的梁木去掉，然后才能清楚地除去你弟兄眼中的刺。八、七、八次。

现在这道理很明白，让我帮助你们深入理解一下。当你出生在一个家庭时，和你自动建立的关系并不是朋友。你是选择你的朋友，不是恋人；你是选择你的恋人，而不是亲戚。你不能选择你的亲戚。

看看你的亲戚吧！这些人是你不会主动选择的。看看你的兄弟姐妹。他们是自然而然地出现在你生命中的。

你不希望成为孤儿。不，不，你更愿意有父母而不希望没有父母。这就是拥有父母带来的麻烦。你不希望成为孤儿。

你有了父母，也就有了家庭。你就自动有了亲戚、兄弟和姐妹。这些人不是朋友或恋人。那些是你选择的关系，是自愿建立的联系。

而家庭关系则是与那些你并不特别喜欢的人之间的关系。然而，你却无法轻易摆脱他们。他们是存在的，并且你有责任去见他们，处理与他们的关系。耶稣竟然用这样的术语来形容其他基督徒给你们听。

让我们换个说法吧。当你通过耶稣与天父建立关系时， 基督教的核心就是他不是你的老板。你不是在为老板工作。只要你继续产出成果，你就还有这份工作。

但如果你停止生产，就会被解雇。他是父亲，**这意味着你有一个持久、无条件且不依赖于任何功绩的关系。**但**这意味着，与朋友之间的关系不同，当你进入一个友谊时，是因为我认为我能从这段关系中得到一些东西。**我喜欢你，你也喜欢我。

让我们一起行动。我们有共同的兴趣，那就是朋友。或者你坠入了爱河。哇。

你是被吸引的自己。你是被我吸引的。等等。这些都是有条件的联系。

但是家庭是无条件的。耶稣说，如果你想与你的父亲建立一种无条件的关系，你就会获得与其他兄弟姐妹之间的无条件关系。你会有身边的人。基督徒现在就是家人。

你们必须像对待家人一样对待他们。你们对他们负有责任。这不是自愿的关系。我知道。

我这样说是出于最负面的角度。为什么呢？因为这就是它的意义所在。基本上，你可以把他们变成朋友。

你应该尝试这样做。事实上，我们接下来要花时间讨论如何做到这一点。你想要把兄弟姐妹变成朋友。在某些情况下，你甚至会想娶一个兄弟或姐妹，希望如此。

你会想至少让其中一人成为恋人和配偶。但事实是，他们都开始是兄弟姐妹。**这意味着你们之间有一种无条件的关系。**他们是你的。

无论你喜欢与否。在很多情况下，实际上，在大多数情况下，你不会喜欢他们。就像你不喜欢自己的亲戚一样多。这就是耶稣所说的。

在C.S.刘易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》中，有一个地方，当伟大的狮子阿斯兰复活了。或者就像耶稣一样。然后他低下头对他的两个女孩苏珊和露西说：“现在，”阿斯兰说道，“我们有很长的旅程要走，你们必须骑在我身上。”于是他俯身下去，孩子们爬上了他温暖金色的背部，苏珊首先紧紧抱住他的前腿，露西则紧抱着苏珊。

然后他们感觉到脚下有一种巨大的力量升起，飞得比任何马匹都要快。这非常有趣。如果你读过这个故事，并且你知道一些关于这些角色的情况，你会发现作者C.S. 莱斯利描绘了复活后的教会及其与主的关系。因为这就是他要表达的。

苏珊，在书中所有的孩子中，她是那个软弱的孩子。她在灵性上是软弱的。她迟钝，对露西很残忍。她永远不明白。

从灵性的角度来看，她有点愚蠢。但露西才是那颗**真正的心。露西是**最亲爱的心。露西拥有最深的灵眼。

露西与阿斯兰的关系也最好。但C.S. 莱斯利却让露西骑在阿斯兰背上，并且唯一能抓住阿斯兰的方式就是抓着苏珊。这正是圣经所说的。如果你想与耶稣建立关系，如果你想在他使命中与他相关，阿斯兰说：“我们有很多地方要去，很多事情要做。

” 你必须抓住我。但你只能通过愿意抓住苏珊——那些你不喜欢的兄弟姐妹们——来抓住我。当你读这本书时，如果你真的读了这本书，你会认同露西。你会想：如果有人配得上骑在阿斯兰背上并独自实践神秘主义，那就是她。

她抓住了主要的个人联系。我不需要任何人。你就会发现，通常今天的美国人会说：“我想变得灵性化，但我不想宗教化。”他们实际上的意思是：“我想要一种与神直接的个人经历，但不想处理其他人。

我不想加入一个机构。我不想成为某个团体的一部分。” 而圣经中的上帝却说：“我不是这样运作的。如果你要抓住我，你必须通过抓着苏珊来实现——即通过那些你不情愿成为朋友的人来实现。

”因为你现在与他们有关联了。你必须爱他们，了解他们。问题来了：我能与你个人化吗？你们当中，有基督徒在你们周围，是你们的兄弟姐妹。

但你们知道，他们不是朋友，而是你们的兄弟姐妹。你们愿意接纳他们吗？你们愿意与他们相处吗？你们试图把他们变成朋友吗？

耶稣首先谈到的就是建立新的基督教社区的重要性。祂并不是单独作用于你个人的生命中，而是集体地作用在你的生命中。其次，祂不仅谈到了建立基督教社区的必要性，还谈到了这种关系的深度。你看，你应该有深厚的关系。

有人可能会问：有多深呢？到底要达到什么程度？耶稣在第23节里告诉我们，祂告诉了我们这种深度和强度。所以，如果你正在祭坛前献上礼物，而你想起你的兄弟对你怀恨在心，那就先把礼物留在那里，先去与你的兄弟和解，然后再来献上你的礼物。

这里有两个标准。耶稣在这里告诉我们，你们必须与基督徒有多深的联系——这种联系要达到个人问责制和集体灵性层面。什么是个人问责制？首先，当你正在祭坛前献上礼物时，如果你想起你的兄弟对你怀恨在心，那就先把礼物留在那里，先去与你的兄弟和解。

这听起来很奇怪，仔细听好。这里并没有说你对你的兄弟有怨恨，甚至也没有说你做了什么对不起他的事。你看清楚了：这个人，无论他是谁，对你有怨恨，但你对他却没有怨恨。如果这个人对你怀恨在心，他应该来找你吗？

是的。但他没有来。为什么不来呢？要么是因为他胆小，要么是因为他太敏感，自己捏造了一些事情，情绪过于激动，过度怨恨。

换句话说，就是这个人有错。如果是自愿的关系，你大可不必去管那么多。我说的是他的责任。如果他对你有意见，就应该来找我，明白吗？

耶稣在神的家里要求你负责，无论那个人是否值得，无论那个人是愚蠢还是聪明，无论你是否有过错，你都有责任去面对。为什么？你要负责任。你要为那个人的精神成长负责，而那个人也要为你负责。

圣经说这就是区别。这就是区别。友谊是一种非正式、自愿的相互关系，但你的兄弟姐妹、家人之间，你们彼此都要承担责任。希伯来书第三章第十三节说：“要彼此劝戒，免得你们中间有硬心的人。

” 这非常有趣，“硬心”。圣经说，罪就像寒冷的空气，你的心就像一桶水。如果你冬天去野营，你知道必须不断打破桶顶结的冰，因为水会自然结成冰。如果不经常打破，转眼间你就找不到可以喝或煮东西的水了。

圣经说，你的心也是如此。它总是变得骄傲或者因骄傲而变硬，或者因悲伤而变硬。如果你的生活顺利，它会因为骄傲而变硬；如果生活不顺，它会因悲伤而变硬，但无论如何，它都在变硬。它总是自然地变硬，就像寒冷天气里的水。

希伯来书第三章第十三节说了什么呢？唯一的办法就是避免冻结。答案是，你必须有足够了解你的人能和你说你的骄傲、悲伤、问题以及性格缺陷，并且你还得有足够的接触，让你能够坦诚相待。这是一个大问题。

如果你是基督徒，生活在这个时代，你就是一个“移动者”。你的朋友也是“移动者”。尤其是在纽约。你们总是和朋友们告别，并且他们也在和你告别，四处奔波。

**这意味着什么？这意味着你对世界上的人敞开心扉，让他们能够触及你的心灵。**但通常情况下，你身边没有人。要知道，不断地与认识你、住在你附近并且你能频繁见到的人建立深入的关系，需要付出巨大的努力。

你需要足够深入地参与其中，以便在你们之间形成个人的责任感。谁真正了解你？谁给你开了绿灯，可以监督你？你向谁敞开心扉？

相当频繁地关于一切事情：你的祷告生活、你如何使用金钱、 你的性生活、你的思想…… 如果没有这样的人……耶稣说…… 耶稣说，你需要有能够对你负责并且你也对对方负责的人，并且他们要不断地触及你的心灵。他们是哪些人？你有吗？首先，他强调你需要建立深入到个人责任感的关系。

仅仅表面上的交往——在教堂里和每个人都打招呼、拥抱亲吻是不够的。其次，他也在这里向我们展示，你还必须建立深入到不仅个人责任感，还有集体灵性层面的关系。什么意思呢？让我们再看一遍经文。

问题是什么？你需要去找到你的兄弟，并把他带到祭坛前。而你的兄弟不在那里。这里的关键在于，不要独自敬拜。

你不能独自敬拜。这并不意味着…… 这并不是说，我想去一个有1500人的大教堂，那比一个小教堂更灵性。那不是我们要谈论的内容。这里才是我们要谈论的内容。

圣经说，在这个位置上，只有作为神殿，你知道，彼得前书和以弗所书2章也这样说，我们是被圣灵居住的活石。你了解那个图像吗？那不仅仅是一个美丽的图像。它是美丽的。

我们是石头，彼此建造在一起，彼此黏合在一起，主住在我们里面。只有当我们一起时，我们才能被居住。C.S.刘易斯在他的书《四种爱》中这样说。顺便说一句，今晚我用的所有都是C.S.刘易斯的插图。

有没有人注意到？C.S.刘易斯说，在他还是一个圆的时候，他是三个朋友中的一个。杰克、罗纳德，杰克是杰克。杰克、罗纳德和查尔斯。

当查尔斯去世后，他认为他会拥有更多的罗纳德。但他说的话是，令他惊讶的是，他发现他拥有的罗纳德更少了。这就是他说的。他说，在我的每一个朋友身上，有一些只有其他某个朋友才能完全激发出来的特质。

独自一人时，我无法充分激活整个个人。独自一人时，我无法充分激活整个个人。现在查尔斯去世了，我将永远看不到罗纳德对他的幽默反应。远非拥有更多的罗纳德，现在查尔斯走了，我拥有的更少了。

这个夏天你是否在寻找增长信仰的方法？或者你希望帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心？对于很多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的时间来深化我们的信仰和我们对跟随基督意义的理解。今年夏天开始使用的一个很好的资源是新的城市 catechism 日课，《神的心智与真理》。

这个日课将基督教教会的古老 catechisms 带入生活，每周提供一个问题供你思考。在引言中，提摩西·凯勒阐述了 catechesis 的案例，这是一种丰富的、群体性的学习和记忆问题及答案的过程，这些问题是构成基督教信仰基础信念的关键。每个星期包括一段圣经经文、一个祷告和一篇简短的冥想，将挑战并激励你。包括的注释由当代牧者如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒和凯文·D·杨，以及历史人物如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德撰写。

本月除了新的城市 catechism  devotionals 外，我们还将提供一个新的儿童版城市 catechism，作为您对传播福音和生命的礼物的感谢，帮助基督之爱与世界各地的人们分享希望。所以，请访问 gospelonlife.com/give 获取您的副本。现在，提摩太·凯勒将为大家继续今天的教导。那么，路易为什么提到这一点呢？

如果一个人真的无法完全了解另一个人，这是事实。你结婚后会发现这一点，你以为自己已经很了解对方了。一对一地相处时，确实如此。你比任何人都更了解他们。

但即使如此，仍然会有新的朋友或新人进入你的生活，这个人会让你的配偶展现出你从未见过的一面。即便你们已经在一起10年、15年甚至20年，依然如此令人惊讶。为什么呢？这里有一个原则：作为个体，你无法完全吸引一个人的所有特质和行为。

你不能把所有东西都展现出来。只有在群体中，你才能更好地了解一个个体。如果对人类来说这是真的，那么对于上帝本身又如何？**这意味着如果你只认识两三个基督徒，你可能不会很好地了解上帝。**

如果你认识更多的基督徒，他们共同了解的越多，你就越能了解上帝，因为他们看到了上帝的一部分特质，这种特质只有他们能看到，并且他们也会展现出其他基督徒看不到的方面。因此，除非你和别人一起祷告，除非你和别人一同敬拜，除非你有可以和他们谈论你的基督教信仰、关于上帝的感受、以及与上帝的挣扎的人。如果没有这样的人与你一起祷告、赞美上帝，你就不太了解祂。耶稣说：“去招聚你的兄弟。

” 我不想让你独自站在祭坛前。去招聚你的姐妹。我不想让你独自一人。这就是这个新社区的必要性，也是它的强度所在。

第三点，我们被教导关于这个新社区的对称性。现在，我想说的是，对称性，你说得对。你怎么能让这些关系变得如此深入？你如何让它们达到这样的深度？

耶稣说关键在于以平衡的态度对待他人。这种平衡体现在真理和爱之间。但看看他是怎么说的。在第7章的最后一节：“不要论断人，免得你们被论断。

” “因为你们怎样论断别人，也会怎样被论断。”很好，这很有意思。不要评判他人，对吧？不要定罪。

听起来不错。但往下看第六节。“拿不去给狗的东西，也不要把珍珠丢给猪。”如果你这样做，它们可能会践踏这些珍珠，并且把里面的珠子踩碎。

在第一节中，他说：“不要论断人。” 到了第六节，他却称人们为猪和狗。现在，你认为这是矛盾的吗？你不懂这种平衡。

几乎没有人真正理解这一点。我也不懂。事实上，除了耶稣，没有人能做到这一点。圣经一再告诉我们，在爱中包含真理的重要性。

如果你只是说：“我不想告诉任何人真相。”“我不想指出他们错了。” “我不愿意挑战或纠正。”我是谁来评判他们呢？

如果你们的关系总是这样，我们总是在说：“我是谁来评判他们呢？”这就是没有真理的爱，并不是**真正的爱。你说：“我不想评判别人。” 但你从不情愿地说这个人是**猪，那个人是狗，或者这个人很愚蠢。

这个人灵性迟钝。如果你从不勇于挑战，如果只是无原则地爱，那根本就不是爱。那叫偶像崇拜。那是自我放纵。

那是懦弱。因为你没有给他们真正需要的。你所谓的爱如果没有真理，那根本就不是**真正的爱。你是**在爱自己。

你是懦夫。你在爱自己。你不希望那个人离开。你太依赖他们了。

因此，如果你太依赖他们，那也不是真爱。你只是通过他们来爱自己。你是在利用他们。但另一方面，没有爱的真理，就是谴责人、放弃人、对人提出高标准然后说他们达不到标准。

没有爱的真理根本就不是**真正的真理。你知道为什么吗？因为这告诉人们上帝并不是**恩典。没有爱的真理实际上是一种谬误。

第六节的话多年来被许多人这样解读。有人读到这一节就说，显然珍珠和圣洁的事物是神的事物、真理、福音、天国的事物。显然这里的意思就是不要给那些不能欣赏的人那些东西。不要给不相信福音的人传道。

不要告诉他们这些。不要给那些不配的人这些东西。不要把真理带给他们，他们会践踏它。你听过这样讲吗？

讨论过吗？其实我不得不承认，在很久以前，我在1977年的一次布道中说过类似的话：这一节的意思是不要把真理带给那些不能欣赏的人。这里有一个小问题。我在读达拉斯·威拉德的《神圣密谋》这本书时发现，如果这意思是说你不应该给那些不能欣赏的人传道，那么耶稣为什么还要来呢？

我意思是，耶稣啊，如果你说，不要把真理告诉那些不能欣赏它、不配拥有它的人。那耶稣根本就不用跑这一趟了。这里头没有人值得拥有它，能欣赏它。而且顺便提一句，如果真是这样理解第六节的话，那么耶稣就没有听自己的建议，因为他下来了，他告诉那些不欣赏真理的人，他们也没有转而攻击他，反而把他撕成了碎片。

然而这并不是说的这个意思。达拉斯·威拉德在这方面做得非常好，他说这不是在说猪和狗不能欣赏真理，而是说他们不能消化真理。当说到“抛”时，你要对猪抛什么？你给猪的食物。

他说的意思是，当你以这种方式给人真理时，就像把珍珠扔给一个非常饿的猪，它咬下去会很痛，吞下后也会被卡住。最终他指出，达拉斯·威拉德说，这些猪最终会反过来攻击你。为什么呢？因为至少你是可以吃的。

这里的意思是，爱没有真理不是**真正的爱，但真理没有爱也不是****真正的真理。当你把真理强加给别人，强迫他们接受它，或者要求他们理解或处理它就像你自己那样时，这种做法就是**如此。在C.S.刘易斯的非线性小说《马与男孩》中，有两个角色，一个叫沙斯塔，另一个叫阿拉武斯。沙斯塔是个男孩，阿拉武斯是个女孩。

有一天他们在旅行时，一只狮子出现了，用它巨大的爪子抓伤了阿拉武斯的背部，很疼，流了很多血，然后狮子消失了。后来在书里，沙斯塔遇到了阿斯兰，也就是那只狮子，他是基督的象征。沙斯塔问：“你就是曾经伤害过阿拉武斯的那只狮子吗？”阿斯兰回答说：“是的。

”沙斯塔又问：“为什么你要这么做？你是伟大的国王，是个好人，一个伟大的救世主。为什么要这样做呢？” 他这样说。

他对他说：“孩子，”他说，“我告诉你你的故事，不是她的。”“我没有告诉任何人任何人的故事，只有他的。” 现在，C.S.刘易斯从圣经中得到了这一点，具体来说是从约翰福音的结尾部分得到的。彼得问及约翰使徒时说：“主啊，这以外，那将如何呢？

”耶稣回答说：“我并没有告诉任何人他们的其他故事，我只是告诉你你的故事。” 那么这话是什么意思？这就是为什么基督徒无法保持这种平衡的原因。基督徒，你必须讲真理，你必须面对别人，但你必须非常、非常小心。

你只知道自己的故事。你完全不了解别人的全部故事。你不知道他们应得什么，也不知道上帝在他们生命中做了些什么。你看不到他们的整个旅程。

你不应该为他们规定你的经历，否则你会把他们变成猪。这句话背后的含义是，你应该配得上被吃掉，他们会转向你咬你，因为你坚持这种方式和顺序必须如此，并且要求接受这一点。不，不，不，不，不。没有爱的真理不是**真正的爱，但没有爱的真理也不是**真正的真理。

你需要在面前的伟大灵魂面前保持谦卑，需要在基督正在那个人身上形成之前保持谦卑。除非你有这种认识，如果你看不到另一个基督徒生命中上帝所做的伟大工作，如果你不明白这一点，要么你会爱而不讲真理。但是耶稣说：“不，”如果有人出了问题，约翰福音23节说，“去到他那里，与他和好，弄清楚。” 去吧，去吧，你绝对不能沉默。

你绝不能胆怯。但另一方面，你也不能认为你知道那个人必须做什么，或者那个人必须跳过什么障碍。不，生活中必须在真理和爱之间保持对称、平衡。现在我知道有人会说。

“有人可能会问，我如何知道我对其他人的态度是否不平衡？” --- This translation maintains the original structure, tone, and meaning while ensuring it reads naturally in Simplified Chinese. 如何知道自己的关系是否不平衡？哦，假设它就是如此。假设你就是那个需要被平衡的人。

在没有圣灵的情况下，我们天生的气质要么是真理型，要么是爱的类型。要么你是一个友善、圆滑和温柔的人，但本质上是个懦夫；要么你是一个直接、挑战性的人，但本质上却无情无感。我们会偏向其中一种。而要让关系达到个人问责和集体灵性的深度平衡，唯一的办法就是研读耶稣如何对待人的故事，并一遍遍地阅读。

最后，这就是必要性、强度和平衡，那么因果是什么呢？是什么导致了这种类型的关系？其实这很微妙，但让我简单说明一下：当耶稣说“不要论断”时，他并不是让你不评判或评价他人，而是要你不要定罪。他不是说不要评估，你需要评估。

否则你怎么能说出真相？否则你怎么知道别人需要什么？他说：“不要定罪。”而这里的“定罪”这个词在罗马书8章1节中也出现过。

如今，在基督耶稣里的就没有定罪的了。如果你知道耶稣基督被审判，如果知道耶稣基督承担了所有的定罪，这会在你内心创造一种能量，使你的评判性思维完全消失。这就是平衡。只有这样，才能带来这种平衡。

让我以实际的方式结束这段话。我来说说三种人：如果你不确定自己是否是基督徒，或者对信仰有些迷茫，处于灵性探索过程中，请找一个你尊敬的基督徒朋友，你会很难独自理解福音和耶稣的信息。上帝不会那样工作，他会通过人来工作。这不是很棒吗？

你知道，不要说：“哇，真好。”这不是世界上的大问题吗？去读一读福音书吧，在那里你会看到约翰·施洗者告诉安德烈关于耶稣的事。然后他遇见了耶稣。

安德烈又把耶稣介绍给腓力。于是他也遇见了耶稣。斐勒比又把耶稣介绍给拿但业，拿但业也遇见了耶稣。这些人没有一个是自己找到的。

如果你在灵性上迷茫，不知道相信什么，并且试图独自阅读书籍来到赎罪堂寻求答案，无论你是否被音乐或讲道所激励，除非有朋友一起讨论，否则你会感到无聊或者困惑。其次，基督徒朋友们，你们如何通过参加礼拜获得个人责任和集体灵性？是每周都来参加礼拜吗？还是通过做志愿者或其他方式？

不是的。只有在小组中才能做到。可以是你自己组织的小组，也可以是一个已经存在的小组。除非有基督徒们一起祷告并互相监督，否则你无法遵行耶稣基督对你的呼召。

最后，还有一个CS Lewis 的参考。今晚有六次讨论。几年前Lewis 写了一本书叫《大信仰》。实际上那是一系列的广播讲座。

他基本上说：我不会谈论希腊正统教或罗马天主教或长老会或浸信会。我只是要谈论一般的大信仰。很多人都喜欢这个观点，不是吗？我们不希望陷入宗派和分歧中，我们只想做基督徒。

当然我们都想这样。然而他在书的开头写了一个重要的警告。他说：我希望没有读者认为《大信仰》在这里提供的是现有教会的一种替代品。正如你能选择基督教而排斥长老会、公理会或圣公会或东正教一样。

我所写的更像是一个走廊，从这个走廊可以通向不同的房间。如果我能把任何人带进这个走廊，我就已经完成了我的目标，但真正重要的不是在走廊里，而是那些房间里才有火炉、椅子和食物。现在听我说，因为我深知这一点是许多人的实际情况。我们希望成为“通用”的基督徒。

我们厌恶特定性的丑闻。正如刘易斯所说，我们都想仅仅做个泛泛的基督徒。但他指出，如果你真的想要火炉、椅子、食物、休息或成长，你必须进入一个真实的教会，进入一个人们彼此负责的教会。你需要进入一个有契约、有问责制的教会。

**这意味着它必须是一种特定类型的教会，可能是浸信会、公理会，甚至可能是圣公会，或者至少认同我们教会的教义。**我知道你们中有人会说：“我们不是宗派。”那是因为你们是独立教会。也就是说，这是那些坚持自己不是宗派的教会。

你永远不可能真正地在恩典中成长，除非进入一个真实的教会，并且这个教会会有你不赞同的观点。我不喜欢他们施洗的方式，不喜欢他们在某些事情上的做法。特定性的丑闻，你永远不会找到一个完美的教会。但许多你们仍然停留在走廊里。

你们徘徊不定，在不同的教会之间跳来跳去，或者干脆不参加任何教会。你们只是泛泛的基督徒，但正如刘易斯所说，只有在那些房间里才有火炉、椅子和食物。只有在那些有所有缺点和具体细节的真实特定教会里，你才能找到这些。这就是你没有成长的原因。

你需要参与一些事情，需要在某个特定的教会站稳脚跟。你看，耶稣基督说，你们已经加入了家庭。那就是祷告。我们感谢你，天父，赐给我们这个家。

哦，我们渴望有家庭，直到真正拥有它为止。我们想要兄弟姐妹。听起来如此美妙，直到亲眼见到他们。兄弟姐妹不是我们选择的。

他们不是朋友，也不是恋人。他们是真正的兄弟姐妹。主啊，我们生活中有很多人没有被当作兄弟姐妹认真对待。求你帮助我们承认并接纳我们的兄弟姐妹，并使他们逐渐成为朋友和同工。

因为我们要紧紧抓住的人越多，就越会紧紧抓住你的儿子。奉他的名祷告。阿们。感谢大家今天听讲道。

愿你们从其中得到鼓励，并将其应用到生活中去。更多来自提姆·凯勒的有帮助资源，请访问gospelandlife.com。在那里，你可以订阅《福音与生命》季度期刊。订阅后，你还将获得免费的文章、讲道、灵修材料和其他优秀的以福音为中心的资源。
