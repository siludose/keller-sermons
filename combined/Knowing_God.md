## 认识真实的神

Welcome to Gospel and Life. How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King.

This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. The reading today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21.

For I am not ashamed of the Gospel because it is a power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith, from first to last, just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.

For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God, nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord.

So we are again in a fourth week of a series we're doing called public faith, sharing the hope that's within, and each week in the small groups we're talking about what we are talking about here on a Sunday morning, and we don't live in a society that encourages people to be public about their religious faith and their religious beliefs, which is really ironic, because we are encouraged in our society to be public about everything else. We have to tell people who we are, but think about it. There's nothing more fundamental to your identity and who you are than your religious beliefs.

And therefore, if we're going to have a truly open and pluralistic society, we all have to learn how to be public about who we are, about our deepest faith beliefs, and yet to do so in a way that's respectful to others and promotes peace. And that's what we're exploring in these morning messages in the small groups each week. Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God and about God's existence?

You're not going to be able to talk public about faith, you can't talk about God in this existence, but you go about that without getting into a shouting match and it goes like this. God does exist. No, God doesn't exist.

That's the internet right there, you know? And sometimes actually out on this street, I think one of the ways to make people more reflective is to not ask the question, does God exist, but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists?

How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not, how do you know that? See, as soon as you start to ask the question, how do you know whether there's a God, or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God?

It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more. And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question. How can you know whether there's a God or not, than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1, written by St.

Paul. I don't think there's any more brilliant and ingenious answer to the question. How can we know whether there's a God or not than here?

Because Paul actually gives you four answers, pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all. Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God.

We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God.

We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way, and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here.

Let's take a look. First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God. So for example, the famous verses, they're all famous, 19 and 20.

What may be known about God is plain, for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made. Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world.

There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence. He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence from what you see in nature. Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs.

And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world, you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook, they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature and the created order are proofs, they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them, then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument, and there's the teleological argument.

Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in. A proof is something that no rational person can deny.

No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it. And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties, of our hearts and minds were in better condition, we would acknowledge those clues more readily.

But they're there. What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much.

He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute, just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

The cosmological argument works like this. How could something come from nothing? That's it.

So for example, you know, the big bang theory, the universe started with a bang. How could nothing have exploded? You know, nothing can't explode.

So how could the explosion come from nothing? Well, somebody says, well, it wasn't that there was nothing. There was something.

Okay, but where'd that something come from? And as soon as you keep asking that question, where did that something come from? It came from that, where did that something come from?

And if you go all the way back to say, well, there was something that had no cause, that it didn't come from nothing, it was always there since we know nothing in this world like that. Everything we know has a beginning. Everything we know is an effect with a cause.

As soon as you start talking about an uncaused cause, as soon as you start talking about something that has no, there was always there, you're talking about something supernatural. Say, something that we don't know here in nature, something beyond nature, something divine. And see, that's how the cosmological argument goes.

And says, how could all this come from nothing? And if it didn't come from nothing, then what brought it about? The teleological argument is actually kind of fun, too.

And again, I'm looking at my watch. They're just fun. If they're not enough to make people believe in God, they haven't.

But they are there, the clues are there. The teleological argument comes from the word telos, which means design. And it talks about the fact that the world is so perfectly designed, how could it have come about by accident?

Now the physicist will tell you this, and I have to look at my notes just to say it right, that the fundamental regularities and constants of physics, things like speed of light, gravitational constant, the strength of weak and strong nuclear forces, all of these things have to be perfectly calibrated. It's almost like there are a hundred dials, and every single dial has to be exactly at the right spot, not a single one can be off a hair. They all have to be so perfectly calibrated in such a way for matter to coalesce, unless all those things were exactly the way they are, we wouldn't have matter, we wouldn't have a world, we wouldn't have human life.

And so what many people have said is, so many things had to happen exactly the way they are, whether it even be human life, even to be life, even to be matter, that couldn't happen by accident. So God did it. That's the teleological argument.

Now people like Richard Dawkins or Stephen Hawking, who are atheists, spend a lot of time refuting that argument, and you know what that means? It means it must have force or they wouldn't spend the time. But you know what they all say?

What Dawkins says, you know what Stephen Hawking says? What they say is that at the big bang, there could have been an infinite number of possible universes formed, and we just happen to be in the universe where matter coalesces, where all the various fundamental regularities and constants of physics are exactly the way they ought to be for life to happen. So there we are.

There's an resilience and resilience of those universes and we just happen to be in the one where it happens. And of course there's a lot of philosophers have a lot of fun with that. I'm going to just give you one.

John Leslie is a philosopher that tells you this story. John Leslie tells you this story. He says, imagine there's a man about to be executed.

And so this sergeant gets 50 crack marksmen and lines them up six feet from the prisoner. And so 50 crack marksmen with their rifles, six feet from the prisoner, ready, aim, fire. And they all miss.

The sergeant says, what happened? Every single man says, gosh, serge, I just had a twitch my nose, you know, something in my eye, you know, I'm sorry, all 50 at once. And the sergeant says it can't hold me with 50 at once.

And then one guy who took a philosophy course says, but sergeant at the big bang, there could have been a zillions of possible universes formed. And we just happened to be in the universe where all 50 crack marksmen happened to, you know, have a twitch in their nose at the very same moment. Now, you know, first of all, the sergeant, if he also took a philosophy course, he would have to say, you're right, I can't prove that this was a conspiracy.

Because we just happened to maybe be in the one universe, right? I can't prove it, but I know it was a conspiracy. I would never, in a million years, it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that we just happened to be in the one universe where all that can happen.

I want you to assume it's a conspiracy. That it was as somebody did it. That it was contrived, that there was some personal action, there was some personal design involved, right?

He wouldn't assume the one in a zillion chance happened. He would assume it was a personal design. And for you to say, there's a one in a zillion chance that maybe there is no God.

Does that make sense to base your entire life on that? So these are the cosmological and teleological arguments. And these are basically forms of the kinds of clues that people have seen over the years.

And Paul says they're there. They're really our clues. But Paul says something much more radical than that.

A lot more radical. Because he doesn't just say it's possible to know God by looking at nature. He actually goes a little beyond that, way beyond that, and says every human being actually does know God.

See where he says that? He says God is mad. And why is he mad?

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people. This is everybody, humanity, who suppress the truth. What truth?

What is known, may be known about God. And then down in verse 21, he says, for although they knew God, they wouldn't glorify Him as God. What he is saying is people, all people are suppressing the truth about God's existence.

Now you can't suppress something unless you've got it. And what he's saying is at some very deep level, every human being knows that God is there. Now this, by the way, is a very offensive statement to people.

In fact, just in the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times yesterday, there was a letter to the editor. The letter to the editor had to do with some op-ed piece that I happen to miss. But some op-ed person had said this term in one of the op-ed pieces earlier this week that there are no atheists and foxholes.

You've heard that. That when the shooting begins and even the atheist show that they actually believe in God, well, one atheist wrote in and he was very offended and is what he said. And this is fair.

He says, quote, he says, the implication that atheists are all really theists at heart and that our convictions are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned in the face of adversity is simply untrue. He says to say, he's an atheist. He says to say that I'm really a theist at heart and my atheism, my beliefs, our convictions, are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned.

He just isn't true. Well, see Paul is not saying anything like that. Here's what Paul is saying.

Yes, Paul is saying that it's some level everybody knows there's a God. But as we're going to see in a minute, he's also saying at a profound level, everybody, we all believe in God yet we don't believe in God. And what's interesting, the translators can never get this right because it's a very awkward construction.

But Paul deliberately, when he says, what may be known about God, is plain to them. For since the creation of the world's invisible qualities, eternal power, have been clearly seen, being understood, the verbs there are present passive participles in Greek. And what it means is, and this is what the commentators say, what it means is that the reality of God bears down on us constantly.

That is that there's part of our heart that doesn't believe God's there and yet there's another part of our heart that's sensitive to his reality and that reality bears down on us. So what Paul is describing is a deeply conflicted dialogue between the part of our hearts that denies the existence of God and the part of our hearts that's sensitive to his reality. There's nothing casual or shallow about that.

And yet Paul is saying that at some level, in some part of our heart, we know God's there. Now you say, what's the evidence for that? See, we're not talking here, you can look at the arguments for God and infer his existence.

We're saying, Paul is saying that all people already know about his existence. At some level, they know he's there. Well, what's the evidence for that?

I have, after many, many years of finding it interesting to read the biographies of atheists who have become Christians. I see what Paul is talking about. There's a whole slew of prominent, some more famous than others, British intellectuals who are atheists and who became Christians.

I mean, some of them are more famous like T. S. Eliot, W.

H. Auden, I see a slew. Some are a little less famous like C.

E. M. Joan, A.

N. Wilson. People like they all have initials, lots of initials there.

But a lot of these were British intellectuals, brilliant men, and they were biographers in literary critics and thinkers and that sort of thing in poets. And even though they had rejected Christianity growing up and they became part of the intellectual elites, all of whom laughed at religion and Christianity, they shocked their contemporaries and their peers by embracing Christianity in one form or another. When I look at them and I study them, I see that very seldom, if ever, do they look at the evidence like the cosmologic argument and the teleological argument and they come to conclude, I guess there's a God.

Rather, when they talk about how they found faith, they come to say, they come to see that they believed God all along, they were living as if there was a God. They weren't admitting that they were living as if there was a God and they finally admitted he's got to be there. Very interesting.

Let me just give you two. One is not as interesting and not as well known as the other. A.

N. Wilson, he's more recent. A.

N. Wilson was a... Kathy, I know him because he really turned on Christianity and he wrote a terrible biography of C.

S. Lewis, basically attacking him for his beliefs. He wrote biographies of Jesus of Paul, he was very skeptical of Christianity, rejected it, very brilliant man, but on Easter 2009 he put an article in the paper said, I have embraced Christianity, just shocked everybody and gave an Easter testimony.

And in it, this is what he said, he says most public voices he's talking about in Britain. Most public voices have accepted the idea that only stupid people actually believe in Christianity. As a matter of fact, it's materialist atheism that is not merely an arid creed but is totally irrational.

For materialist atheism says, we are just a collection of chemicals. It has no answer whatsoever to the question of how we should be capable of love or heroism or poetry if we are simply animated pieces of meat. And he goes on and tries to say, he says, people who believe there is no God and that we are just...

what he called us, we're just bags of chemicals and animated pieces of meat that have evolved. Then we say we need to be noble and we need to believe in justice and we need to love each other and he says there's no basis for that. Now you say where does that come from?

Let me give you a second case study because it's a little clearer and more fascinating. W. H.

Auden, a poet, was considered one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. What's interesting to me is that his conversion happened right here in the Upper East Side years ago. He was British but he was living in America during World War II and he had embraced atheism just like everybody in his intellectual class.

But it started evidently when he was... you know that just the northern part of the Upper East Side, sort of the north eastern part of the Upper East Side, Yorkville was back in World War II and in the 30s and 40s a very, very German place. Lots and lots of German people lived here.

And there were a lot of... in fact, when we got here to start the church, there were still lots and lots of German-speaking churches and restaurants and places like that still in the late 80s up in the Upper East Side largely vanished. But during the 40s W.

H. Auden went to... he was working on his German actually and there were a number of German cinemas, places that show German films.

And he went into a film house somewhere in the late 30s and saw a film that obviously had been influenced by Nazism and he saw... he saw American Jew... German people, American...

German American people, these Germans living in America, yelling at the screen slurs against the Jews that appeared in this story. And it shook him. And eventually this is what he wrote.

He came back to Christianity, shocked everybody and this is what he wrote. Let me set this up for you because it's very important. Auden thought that all educated and lightened people would believe in freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity.

Basically believe that all educated people, all cultured people, you know, all reasonable people, people who believed in the importance of human reason and who are cultured, that they would believe in the values of freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. What happened was that Germany had embraced Nazism and Germany was second to none as a sophisticated, educated society, tremendous science, tremendous music, tremendous art, scholarship. You know Germany was second to none and yet they had embraced the idea that you should...

well, that loving your neighbor and justice and human rights was a fiction. We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at gospel in life, August is Goen's share month.

Throughout August we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to gospel in life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world.

It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to gospelinlife.com slash give.

Again, that's gospelinlife.com slash give. Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

So this is what Odin wrote. It created a crisis for him and here's what he wrote. If I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs?

The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated in Hitler have no heaven to cry to. The whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine faith in the absolute. It is tried to make reason the judge.

But either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitler monster will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. And here's what he means. He says he believed in human rights liberty and freedom.

Why? Why should you believe in human rights and freedom? Why?

Especially, let's use your reason, huh? And let's look at nature. But what you see, when you look at nature, reason looks at nature.

It's science and empirical. What do you see? You see the strong eating the weak.

That's nature. That's how you got here. The strong eating the weak.

So now on what basis do you see a strong country eating a weak country or a strong race eating a weaker race, you know, destroying a pressing mark, on what basis do you say that's wrong? What reason? See, you're just using your reason, not morality, not heaven, not moral absence, just your reason.

How do you decide that human freedom and dignity and human rights and justice for all? Why believe that when that's not how nature works? He says Hitler was using reason.

And reason is, hey, we're products of evolution. And so here's basically what he says. Yeah.

Of course, without God, you can have moral feelings. Oh, listen carefully, everybody. Without God, you can have moral feelings.

Sure. You can feel it's wrong to oppress people. You can feel human rights are right, okay?

But without God, there can be no moral obligation. That is you have no right to say that your moral feelings should determine them, their behavior. See, you have moral feelings, your English, they have moral feelings, they're Nazis and they're Germans.

How dare you say that your moral feelings are right and there's a wrong? When there's no standard. And therefore, here's what he decided, if you believe that human rights and justice are not imaginary values, but are real.

And if there is no God, they would be imaginary, but they're not imaginary. Therefore, there must be a God. Without God, there can be moral feelings, but there can't be moral obligation.

You can't say you are obliged to follow my moral feelings. But if you believe, well, they genocide is wrong. Oppression is wrong.

Human rights are right. They're not just my feelings. They're right.

There must be a God. And Auden realized he was believing God all along. He just wasn't being honest with himself.

We know there's a God. Deep down. We suppress it.

But that's the third point. See, the other thing that is so brilliant about Paul's analysis is, is the human condition. We can know God.

And we do know there's a God. And yet, we don't know there's a God. See, when he says, in the very moment he says, we do know God.

He also says, we suppress it. We repress it. So we don't know it.

And yet we do know it. And yet we don't know it. And both are fundamentally the same.

I mean, they're equally strong. Now, what kind of stuff do we modern people know? We tend to suppress or repress.

Why do you suppress something? Why do you repress something? If it's traumatic.

Now, sometimes memories can be traumatic. One of my favorite Agatha Christie novels is Sleeping Murder. And it's about a young woman who buys a house.

And in the house she starts to have flashbacks of a murder she saw. And it turns out that as a little girl, she was in the house and she'd repress the memories of a murder. And that's how the murder works.

Now, the fact is that psychologists will tell you that there's really probably not that many truly repressed memories that are traumatic. I mean, there's a lot of fiction about it and there are a lot of people talk about it in the media. But the reality is it's probably not true that some memories are so traumatic.

We simply repress them. It's pretty rare. But I'll tell you what you do repress.

If you're really angry, you can repress that. No, I'm not that angry. If you're really feeling guilty about something you've done, you can repress that.

No, I don't really feel guilty. Anything about your heart that doesn't fit in with your identity, your way that you'd like to think about who you are. So you have a chosen identity.

I like to think of myself as this or as this or this. And when data comes in, things that you've done or feelings you've got that doesn't fit that data, you screen it out, you suppress it, you repress it. And Paul says that's exactly what we're doing with God.

Why? Because the knowledge of God is incredibly traumatic. So it tells you right here, verse 21, key verse.

For although they knew God, they didn't glorify God. And what's glorify me? They didn't treat God as as big and as glorious as He truly is, as multi-dimensional, as great, as magnificent as He is.

Why? Because they didn't want to thank Him. Now you might say, what?

That's the big sin. That's the whole problem. We don't want to thank God.

Yeah. By the way, even at the legal level, there's this thing called plagiarism. What's plagiarism?

For refusing to thank somebody, for the intellectual property you're ripping off, refusing to thank somebody saying, and I want to acknowledge that I got all these ideas from so we don't say that. Why? Because then we are showing our dependence and showing our obligation and showing we may actually not have complete control over what we're saying.

But you see, if there's a God, then we are utterly dependent on Him. And we are totally obliged to Him. See, if there's a God who made us and keeps us alive every second, then that's traumatic because it means we need to thank Him for everything, which means there's not a single spot in your life that you don't owe Him allegiance.

And we hate that. Because our image of who we are is that we can call the shots. We are our own masters.

We decide what is right or wrong, especially our Western culture tells us that. And so along comes the God of the Bible in particular. And there is no God that's more traumatic than the God of the Bible.

Why? Well, see, what if you say, well, I believe in a God of love, just a God that's a spirit of love everywhere. See, that does not get in the first way.

You don't have to thank that person, do you? That's not a person. You're still in control.

You can still live with the illusion that you're in charge of your life. Or if you believe there's other kinds of God, I just believe that God is the force of life and everything. There's all sorts of ways of believing in God that are traumatic and that we embrace, but the God of the Bible or put it like this.

Imagine you had this really great scam going. There was a neighborhood in New York City that you go to and you dress up as a police officer. You impersonate a police officer.

And the waters park when you go there and they, you know, people give you free sandwiches and they. Top of the morning to you officer and you know, everything goes really nicely. Now, while you're, while you're impersonating the police officer, you'll probably be a little nervous.

You'll be a little afraid that maybe you'll say something that might make, you know, somebody say, what, why would a police officer say this? You're a little nervous, of course, because you're impersonating an officer. But what if in the distance coming walking towards you, you see a real police officer.

You're not just nervous now. You're scared. Why?

Because there's no chance that the real police officer is going to expose you as an impersonator. It will happen. Therefore, all human beings, according to Paul, we want to call the shots.

We want to be our own bosses. We want to be in control of our lives. We want to take credit.

So that's cosmic plagiarism. We want to take credit for who we are and what we've done. We want to pat ourselves on the back in all those ways.

What are we doing? We're impersonating a god. We're impersonating a creator.

You know, we're self-made people and we're worshiping our creator. But what happens? See, when somebody comes along, says, I believe in a god who kind of made the world and now he's off in the, he's a remote or somebody says, I believe in a nature, a god who is nature, I believe in this, I believe.

There's a whole lot of gods that actually don't threaten you. But when you get to the biblical god who creates you and sustains you who is a glorious god and who you to whom you owe everything, that is a god who's going to freak you out. You're going to melt down.

That's like when you're impersonating a police officer and you see a real police officer coming, you're impersonating a god. And when you see the real god coming, the biblical god coming, you go nuts. And Paul says, that's the reason why even though we know there's a god and we actually, in some ways, live as if there's a god.

We were honest with ourselves. We can't not know that there's a god. It presses his reality presses on us all the time.

At the same time, we desperately do not want to believe in God. Everybody in this room, including the guy behind the microphone right now, it says, suppresses the truth to some degree. None of us can bear the full reality of who God is.

It's too threatening. It's too traumatic. We all try to whittle God down somehow, flatten him.

But the biblical god, very traumatic. And so though we can know God and we do know God, we don't know God. Well, what do we do about it?

What can we do about it? Well, there actually is clues here as to what we can do about it and how we can truly know the god who's really there, how we can heal ourselves of our fears so that we can know him truly. And what is that?

Well, let me put it like this. This in some ways gets into the rest of the book of Romans and we're not looking at the whole book of Romans. But let me show you, let's go back to verse 1920 for a minute and say, if you look at nature, he says, if you look at creation, if you look at the things that have been made, what can you learn about God?

He's invisible. He's eternal. He's powerful.

He's divine. Okay. What's missing from the list?

Is there anything there that it says you can't know about God just by looking at nature, just by using your reason, just by using all your rational powers, by trying to be objective? No matter how hard you try, looking at the things that are made, there's one thing you're not going to know anything about. What is it?

Does anything about his love or his grace? And probably that's true. Let's look at nature class.

Let's look at a geologically. Oh, look at the volcanoes. Look at the earthquakes.

Do you just look at that and just say, I just see that God is a God of love. No. Let's look at the nature meteorologically.

Hurricanes, see, you know, tsunamis. Do you just look at nature and say, you just, I just know God is a God of love. Let's look at it astronomically.

You know, we're in a galaxy. Our galaxy is just, you know, zillions and zillions of miles wide. We, and there are 100 billion galaxies we even know of, and we only probably know of a tiny amount of how many there really are.

And do you look at that and the idea that there's a God who made all that, you just look at that and say, oh, I just really want to know a God like that. No, you're scared to death. If there is a God that made all that, what am I?

Let's look at it biologically. You know, Annie Dillard wrote a great book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and went out to live, you know, in the mountains of Virginia years ago. She won a Pulitzer Prize for the book, and she said, I wanted to observe nature.

So she watched at the creek. She watched nature. She thought it would make her close to nature, and she saw how violent nature was.

She saw a giant water bug sting and paralyze a frog, and then put its thing down into its brain and suck its brains out until it sort of collapsed like a piece of clothing with nobody in it. And she said, oh, nature. Do you look at nature, read and tooth and claw, and say, oh, I just know God is a God of love.

No, you will not find that God is a God of love. In fact, now this is a little more controversial. I'm going to take 20 seconds on it.

I promise I can back it up, but I'll just tell you, do you look at other religions? And say, well, other religions all say God is a God of love. No, you go to Buddhism.

They talk about being compassionate if you're a Buddhist. Of course, but it's because this world is unreal, and you shouldn't grab hold of anything. And the idea is that God is an impersonal soul, and we're going to become impersonal souls.

No, they don't believe God is a God of love. In fact, if you talk to Islam, you say, do you believe your God is a God of love? They'll talk about being merciful, but I know with many, many Muslims I've talked to is God a God of love.

They said, no, we wouldn't say that. So where do you get this idea that God is a God of love? It's so pervasive in the world.

I'll tell you where you get the idea. It comes from the Bible. That's the only source in human thought.

But if you really don't just pull what you want out of the Bible and really find the biblical God, here's what you see. Verse 18, wrath. A wrathful God, a God who gets angry at sin, a God who gets incredibly angry at sin.

And a little later on in Romans 3, it'll say, in the wages of sin is death. Wrath, demanding death because we disobey him. And then yet, look, verse 16, 17, but I am not ashamed of the gospel.

For it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. See, first the Jew, the good person, then the Gentile, the pagan person, it doesn't matter. For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed.

A righteousness is not earned, not something that you develop, but is given as a gift. It's by faith, from first to last. And you will live by it.

Now here's the point. When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control.

You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great.

It's great. Why? Because the other person loses control, too.

You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God. A God of love.

Yeah, you know what? You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control.

And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are. That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating.

But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control.

Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit.

He's nailed. He loses complete control. Why?

He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death.

In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control. So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us. Now, what is that?

That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that.

No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to. The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself.

There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God. Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid.

And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you.

It's just too great. Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you. It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross.

And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says. That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers.

What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes.

Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes. My humiliation?

Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot. I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death.

That's wrong. It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die.

For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ. The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was.

But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father.

The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself? Why not leave death to the mortals?

Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love?

That was Father Martin's answer. Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God.

In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord.

Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are. We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray.

注意：这里的翻译尽量保持了原文的语气和逻辑结构，并且保留了引用材料的 > 符号。同时，根据上下文进行了适当的调整以确保自然流畅。如果你真的生气，你可以压抑这种情绪。不，我并不是特别生气。

如果你真的为自己的某些行为感到内疚，你也可以压抑这种感觉。不，我并没有真正感到内疚。关于你内心的东西，如果它与你的身份不符——也就是你希望以怎样的方式看待自己。所以你就选择了一个被选中的身份。

我喜欢认为自己是这样的人或者那样的人。当新的数据进来时，比如你做过的事情或产生的某些感觉，如果这些都不符合这种数据，你会屏蔽它们、压抑它们、甚至压抑它们。保罗说，我们就是这样对待上帝的。为什么？

因为对上帝的认识极其创伤性。所以这里关键的一节经文是第21节： 虽然他们知道上帝，却没有荣耀上帝。荣耀是什么意思呢？他们没有把上帝当作祂真正的伟大和辉煌，没有当作多维度、伟大的、壮丽的存在来敬拜。

为什么？因为他们不想感谢祂。你可能会问：为什么？这就是最大的罪行。

这就是整个问题的核心。我们不想感谢上帝。是的。顺便说一句，在法律层面还有一种叫做剽窃的东西。

什么是剽窃？因为拒绝向某人表示感谢，而实际上从他们那里获取了思想财产，却拒绝承认这一点。为什么？因为我们不想显示我们的依赖和义务，也不愿表明我们可能并没有完全掌控自己所说的一切。

但你看，如果有一个上帝，那么我们就完全依赖于祂。我们必须彻底地对祂负责。也就是说，如果有创造并维持我们生命的上帝，**这意味着**我们需要为一切感谢祂，这就意味着你生命中的每一个角落都欠祂忠诚。****我们讨厌这一点。

因为我们对自己的形象是这样认为的：我们可以掌控局面，我们自己就是自己的主宰。我们决定什么是正确或错误的事情，尤其是西方文化告诉我们如此。而当圣经中的上帝出现时，没有比这更创伤性的存在了。为什么呢？

好吧，如果你说你相信一个充满爱的神，只是一个无处不在的爱的精神。这并不能带你进入第一条道路。你不必感谢那个人，对吧？那不是一个人。

你仍然可以认为自己掌控着自己的生活。或者如果你相信其他类型的神，我只相信神是生命的力量。有各种各样的方式去信仰神，这些方式可能是创伤性的，但我们却欣然接受，但圣经中的神或可以说就是这样的神。想象一下，有一个非常成功的骗局。

在纽约市的一个社区里，你装扮成一名警察。你冒充警察。然后你去了一个水上公园，人们给你免费的三明治，他们对你喊道：“早安，警官。”一切都很顺利。

然而，在你冒充警察的时候，你会有点紧张。你会害怕自己可能会说出一些让别人质疑的话：“为什么一个**真正的警察会这么说？”当然，因为你是**在冒充一名警察，所以你会感到紧张。但假如在远处走来了一名真正的警察呢？

你现在不仅紧张，而是害怕了。为什么呢？因为真正的警察不会把你揭穿为冒牌货。这迟早会发生。

因此，根据保罗的说法，所有的人类都想要掌控局面。我们想做自己的老板。我们想控制自己的生活。我们想为自己所做的事情赢得赞誉。

这就是宇宙级别的剽窃。我们希望为自己是谁以及自己做过的事情赢得赞誉。我们希望以各种方式自我表扬。我们在做什么呢？

我们在冒充神。我们在冒充创造者。你知道，我们是自力更生的人，却在崇拜我们的创造者。但会发生什么呢？

假如有人出现，说他相信一个创造了世界然后就离开的神，或者有人说他相信自然就是神，我相信…… 有很多神其实并不威胁你。但当你面对圣经中的那位创造你、维持你生命的神，祂是一位荣耀的神，你欠祂一切时，那才是会吓到你的神。你会崩溃。这就像你在扮演警察，然后真的警察来了；你在扮演神，而真正的神——圣经中的神来了，你就乱了套。

保罗说，这就是为什么尽管我们知道有神，并且在某种程度上我们像对待神一样生活着， 但我们对自己诚实。我们无法否认有神的存在。祂的现实一直在压迫着我们。同时，我们都极力不想相信上帝。

这间房子里的每个人，包括现在正在麦克风后面的人，都在不同程度上压制真相。没有人能承受全然认识上帝的现实。那太令人恐惧了，太创伤性了。我们每个人都试图以某种方式缩小神、压平祂。

但圣经中的神是极其创伤性的。所以尽管我们知道有神并且确实知道祂，但我们并没有真正地认识祂。那么，我们应该怎么办呢？我们可以怎么办？

实际上这里有一些线索可以帮助我们真正认识那位真的存在、如何治愈我们的恐惧，以便真正认识祂。那是什么呢？让我这样来说。这在某种程度上涉及罗马书的其余部分，我们现在不看整本罗马书。

但让我给你展示一下，让我们暂时回到第1920节，他说：如果你观察自然，如果你看看创造物，你能从中了解到关于神的什么？祂是看不见的、永恒的、强大的。祂是神圣的。那么，清单上缺少了什么呢？

有没有在这些描述中说你无法通过观察创造物、使用理性、运用所有理智的力量、尝试客观地去了解神的一件事？无论你怎么努力，通过观察被造之物，有一件事是你永远不知道的。那是什么？他的爱和恩典中有什么？

这大概是真的。让我们看看自然课。地质学上，看看火山。看看地震。

你只是看着这些，就只能说，我看到一个充满爱的神。不，让我们从气象学的角度来看看自然。飓风、海啸。你只是看自然，就说，我知道这是一个充满爱的神。

让我们从天文学的角度来看一看。你知道我们处在一个星系中。我们的星系有数以亿计甚至数以兆计英里的宽度。而我们知道的星系就有上百亿个，而且我们可能只认识其中极少数。

你看到这些，想到有一个创造了这一切的神，你就说，哦，我真的很想认识这样的神。不，你会害怕得要死。如果有一个创造了这一切的神，那我是谁？让我们从生物学的角度来看一看。

你知道安妮·迪拉德写了一本很棒的书《廷克溪朝圣者》，多年前她住在弗吉尼亚州的山区里观察自然，并因此获得了普利策奖。她说她想接近自然。于是她在溪边观察，观察自然。她以为这会让她更亲近自然，但她发现自然非常暴力。

她看到一只大水虫把青蛙刺倒并麻痹它，然后将它的东西插入青蛙的大脑中吸出大脑直到青蛙像一件没有人的衣服一样瘫软下来。她说：“哦，自然是这样。”你看着这种牙和爪的景象，就说，哦，我知道这是一个充满爱的神。不，你不会找到一个充满爱的神。

事实上，这有点更具有争议性。我保证我会解释一下，但简单地说： 你看看其他宗教，说其他宗教都说神是一个充满爱的神。不，你去看看佛教。他们说如果你是佛教徒，要慈悲。

当然，但这是因为这个世界是虚幻的，不应该执着于任何东西。他们的观点是神是无个性的灵魂，我们会成为无个性的灵魂。不，他们不相信神是爱的神。事实上，如果你问穆斯林，你会说：“你们相信你们的神是爱的神吗？

”他们会谈论仁慈，但我可以告诉你，在我与许多穆斯林交谈中，他们是否认为神是爱的神？他们说不会。那么你从哪里得到神是爱的神这个想法呢？这种观念在世界上如此普遍。

我可以告诉你，这个想法来自圣经。这是人类思想中的唯一来源。但如果你真的不只是随意从圣经中抽取一些内容，而是真正地去寻找圣经中的神，你会发现什么？罗马书18节说：“神的忿怒。

”一个愤怒的神，一个因罪而发怒的神，一个对罪极其愤怒的神。稍后在罗马书3章，它会说：“罪的工价乃是死。”因为违背他，神要求死亡。然而，看，罗马书16、17节又说：“但我以福音为乐。

” 因为这是神的能力，使所有相信的人得救。你看，在福音中，神的义被显明了。这是一种不需要赚取的义，不是你开发出来的，而是作为礼物赐给你的。它是从头到尾依靠信心的。

你会因它而活。现在，关键点来了。当你在爱的关系中把自己交出去，当你进入一段爱情关系时，你会失去控制吗？是的，你会失去控制。

你不能随心所欲地生活。当你进入爱情关系时，你会失去控制，但这很好。这很好，为什么呢？因为对方也会失去控制。

如果这是**真正的爱情关系，你们不会互相利用。如果你只是**抬头看着天空说：“我想相信一个爱神，不审判任何人，接受所有人。”那你就把神弄扁了。一个爱的神。

是的，你知道吗？你害怕失去控制。你和我都害怕失去控制。如果我们只说：“我只相信一个不审判任何人、接受所有人的爱神。

”那是一个没有威胁的平庸之神。它不会揭露你的虚伪。但圣经中的神，福音中的神就是这样。祂是愤怒的神，因为祂对罪怒不可遏；然而，神的儿子耶稣基督来到这个世界，走向十字架，失去了控制。

完全的控制。每个人都可以任意摆布祂。祂被鞭打，祂受苦。祂被钉在十字架上，彻底失去控制。

为什么？祂承担了我们应得的惩罚。祂承受了那愤怒、那死亡。换句话说，神的儿子，道成肉身的神，如此爱我们，以至于愿意失去控制，好为我们承担惩罚，然后宽恕我们并爱我们。

那么，这到底是什么样的爱呢？这是一种不剥削的爱。你看，你可以将自己献给这位神，因为祂为了你而上了十字架。你看，没有任何其他宗教或哲学能提供这样的东西。

福音中的神既是慈爱的神又是圣洁的神——祂如此圣洁，必须惩罚罪；同时又如此慈爱，以至于亲自承担了那惩罚。现在，你面前有一个荣耀的神。一个多维度的神、复杂的神、真实的个人神。你可以认识祂，也可以将自己献给祂而不必害怕。

因此，福音治愈了我心中对神的认识所造成的恐惧。它是独一无二的。事实上，这是我最喜欢《少年Pi的奇幻漂流》中的唯一一段内容，每两三年我就要拿出来读给你们听。这段文字真是太精彩了。

每次我都得重新读给你们听。故事中有个男孩在探索各种宗教，他倾向于印度教，但后来与一位天主教神父交谈后，神父开始向他讲述耶稣和祂的十字架之死。男孩惊呆了，他说：“一个神能忍受逆境我还能理解。印度教中的诸神也遭受过小偷、欺凌者、绑架者和篡位者的困扰，《罗摩衍那》不就是罗摩的一天灾难吗？

逆境？是的。命运的逆转？是的。

背叛？是的。” > 你的羞辱？死亡？

我无法想象克里希纳主会同意被剥光衣服、鞭打、嘲弄，拖着街道，最后还被人钉死在十字架上。我从未听说过印度教的神会死去，但神性不应该被死亡玷污。这不对。让这个基督教之神让他化身受难是错误的。

这等同于让他的部分自我受辱。因为如果太阳要死去，那就不能是假象。如果十字架上的神是在羞辱人类悲剧，那么基督的激情就成了基督的闹剧。太陽的死必须是真的，马丁神父告诉我它确实是真的。

但一旦成了死神，就永远是死神，即使复活了，这太阳口中也必须带着死亡的味道。圣三一也必须被玷污。在上帝之父的右边，必然有一种腐臭的气息。这种恐怖必须是真实的。

为什么上帝要让自己承受这样的痛苦？为什么不把死亡留给凡人？为什么要让美好变得肮脏？为什么要破坏完美？

爱？这就是马丁神父的回答。让我们祈祷。我们的天父，我们永远不会通过观测天空和使用理性与逻辑来了解的，就是上帝的牺牲之爱。

在耶稣基督里，主啊，除了福音，我们无法真正理解这一点，但这正是**我们需要治愈心灵的东西。**因此，我们对你的原始而深刻的内在知识终于可以释放出来。我们害怕你，主。我们害怕失去控制。

你的现实、你的荣耀现实对我们来说太创伤了，但只有通过福音，我们才能被治愈，才能拥抱你，并最终与我们的创造者或制作者、救赎者、我们所建造来崇拜和爱的人重聚。哦，主。教会我们如何公开地分享我们的信仰，那些已经理解福音并经历过你医治的人。让我们在心中使用福音，这样我们就能不断地获得对你现实更美好、更荣耀的视角。

主啊，即使现在，我们中的许多人已经是信徒了，但我们仍然没有完全明白你的伟大是谁。有时我们会扭曲这一点。父亲教导我们要公开地分享我们的信仰，好让别人也能知道通过看见耶稣基督爱子的福音所带来的心灵医治。奉耶稣基督之名祷告。
