## 转向享乐 / The Turn to Pleasure

Welcome to Gospel In Life. Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really last? Is this all there is?

In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ. The book of Ecclesiastes is very, very difficult, and I'm actually teaching it to try to give you overviews. I think if anybody says, oh, this is great, and it's just down to just read it through one time, you're just going to say, what in the world is this doing in the Bible?

And we said last week that one of the reasons for this, one of the reasons for it's difficulty, there are a number of them, and I can't go into all of them every time. I'm not here to give you a survey of Ecclesiastes as much as I'm here to give you to pull out some basic themes that I think are relevant to us today, but Ecclesiastes is the only book of the Bible that's written from the viewpoint of a skeptic, someone who is looking at life without God, someone who's seeking after truth and who's not standing in the place of a person who believes. Now one of the reasons why it's a little difficult is because in the very beginning and at the very end and a couple of places in the middle, it seems like the writer steps away from his doubt and begins to make comments.

And the reason for that, just to show my hand here, is my best understanding of what's going on is that this is a piece of work, it's a brilliant piece of art, and it was also very typical in the Old Testament times, in ancient times, and in that part of the world. For a person to make a point, by essentially taking on a role, in the very beginning and the very end, the author talks about Ecclesiastes, this teacher, this commentator, he talks about him in the third person, and then suddenly in chapter 1 verse 12, he goes in the first person and says, I, the teacher, I did this and I did this and I did this, and then at the very end he comes back out and says, what have we learned? Because what he's doing is he's, this is a man who is a believing person, who believes in God, but he goes into a role and explores what it's like and explores the doubts and the skepticism and difficulties of someone who's searching.

And that's one of the reasons actually why, sometimes it's a little tough to interpret unless you understand that, but on the other hand, it's also one of the reasons why it's so relevant. In December of 97, the New York Times magazine had a whole article, a whole issue on, it was called God Decentralized, the lead article subtitle was, even people without faith are searching for God. And when major newspapers and major magazines who are written and produced by editors and managers and reporters who we know are generally speaking much less religious than the mainstream.

When those places start to devote whole issues on a revival of religious seeking and religious searching, then it just must be true. It must be happening. And I agree with them and agree with that particular issue that there is not yet, I don't think, a revival of religious finding.

There's not a revival of spiritual finding. The churches in the synagogues of the country have not doubled in size, that's a revival. But there is a huge revival of religious searching, maybe not finding what's searching, absolutely.

And this is the only book written from the viewpoint of a searcher. Now, when you go on a spiritual search, there are certain things that people always run into. Last week, we looked at one of them that the Ecclesiastes writer talks about, and that is pain.

What do we do about pain? What do we do about the problem of pain? There's a book called the problem of pain.

In fact, there's lots of books that are essentially on the problem of pain. What do we do about the evil and suffering and injustice of the world? But this week is another problem that you have to deal with of your spiritual searcher, Seeker.

And he brings this up, and he looks at it, and here's what he says. Let's read it. Ecclesiastes 2.1 to 11.

And then a section just a little later, chapter 3, verses 10 to 14, I'll read them together. So I thought in my heart. Well now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good, but that also proved to be meaningless.

After I said his foolish and what does pleasure accomplish, I tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly. My mind still guided me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.

I undertook great projects. I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.

I made reservoirs to water grows of flourishing trees. I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.

I mass silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women's singers and a harem as well, and the delights of the heart of man. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me, and all my wisdom, and all this, my wisdom, stayed with me.

I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired, I refused my heart no pleasure, my heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor. Yet, when I surveyed all that my hands had done, and what I had toil to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, nothing was gained under the sun. I have seen the burden God has laid on men.

He has made everything beautiful in its time. He also has set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and to do good while they live, that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his toil.

This is the gift of God. I know that everything God does will endure forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it.

God does it so that men will revere him. Now what is the other problem? I said there is a problem of pain, but when you go out looking at life, there is another problem out there.

I know we don't tend to think of it as a problem, but it is, it is a spiritual problem, same way. See, when you look at evil and suffering, we look at pain. It is a tremendous puzzle we saw last week, but there is pointers to God in it.

However, this week we are looking at the problem of pleasure. Not the problem of pain. You know, I know.

If I talk to people about God, what do you think about God? I have a problem with God. What is that problem?

Well, pain, evil and suffering. I don't think I have ever really talked to anybody who said, yeah, I have a watch out believing in God. Why?

Pleasure. Why is there pleasure in the world? Why is pleasure the way it is?

My face is tonight and his face is tonight is it should bother you because pleasure is a huge problem. For some of you tonight, there is note, and you know who you are, probably already. It is the biggest problem in your life.

Now, maybe you don't know who you are until we get through it, but some of you know right away. Pleasure is a puzzle. Pleasure is a problem and pleasure has a lot of pointers in it.

Now, what he teaches us is three things here, and I am going to put it this way. He teaches us what pleasure, what it promises, what it how it fails, actually, what it promises, why it fails, and how it points beyond. Okay?

That is basically what he does all the way through in every one of his themes, but what it promises, why it fails, and how it points beyond, first of all, what it promises. Here in verse 1 to 3, it gives us something that is really very, very intriguing. He says, so I thought in my heart, come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.

So I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives. Now, this is important.

Look at the word come now. He doesn't go into his project, which is to live for pleasure until now. Well, what happened before?

See, he's coming out of something that he did in chapter 1, and I didn't print it for you, and we don't have it in front of us, let me read it to you. He's already been through something, and then he turns to pleasure. That's very important to understand what he's saying.

In chapter 1, he says, I devoted myself to study and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. But when I saw all things under the sun, I saw all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind, for with much wisdom comes much sorrow and the more knowledge, the more grief. Now here's what he did.

He did not decide at first to live for pleasure. He said, I am going to use my mind and go look at life, and I'm going to figure out what the meaning of life is and what the purpose of life is and really what life is about and why things happen that they do. Now, remember, and I read it to you, and we mentioned this last week, he said, I looked at life to try to understand life under the sun.

And the word under the sun, which he throws up again and again in the book of Ecclesiastes, he tells us, he's looking at life like a practical secular person. He's looking at life, as John Lennon says, imagine, no heaven, no hell, no eternity, just this life, living for today. And he says, if that's all we have, we don't know what comes before, we don't know the after.

If that's all we have, he went there to try to figure out what the meaning of life was and he, what did he decide, what did he determine, what did he conclude? He concluded, if this life all there is, there are no answers to the big questions. If this life is all there is, there's no answers to the big questions, what, what, what were we here for?

What are we for? What is our purpose? What is right and wrong?

What is the absolute moral standard? What is truth? Where do we go when we die?

There are no answers. And that's when he turns to pleasure. Now this is very important.

When he looks at life as it is and comes and says there are no answers, and then he turns to pleasure, he's recapitulating Western history. First of all, you should know that those of us who live in America, you are living what we are called Western society, increasingly it's broader than American and Europe because of technology. But in Western society, we are the first society whose cultural leaders as a whole have said, there are no answers.

I mean, there's never been a society that wasn't built on some kind of religion or philosophy that said here are the answers. It could have been Buddhist, it could have been shinto, it could be islamic, Christianity, Judaism, something. But we're really the first one, even, and I would just say, what about communism?

No, sorry, communism also believed. They know the answers, they know where history is going, they know what's what you're supposed to be doing, they know it, they understand, right? They give the answers.

Now, they're all maybe different, you know, they're contradict, they can't all be right. But here's the thing, where the only one who actually says, there are none. This life is all there is.

When you die, that's it, we have no idea why we're here. And we're building a civilization on that. Now what happens when you do that?

I'll tell you, let me give you a little vignette, actually we have a little vignette right here, but let me give you another one. In radio days, I think that's the name I got. The Woody Allen movie radio days, early on in the beginning of the movie, a boy goes to class, this will teach you to go to science class now.

He goes to class and he hears something and he's just distraught, he's depressed, he's going crazy. And the mother has to drag him to a counselor and sit them down and the counselor says, what's going on? And the little boy says, you know, he's about eight or nine years old and I guess he's been a week or two now since he discovered this, but he says, do you know that the universe is expanding?

Do you realize that eventually everything's going to burn up? Do you realize everything's going to be over? What's the use of doing anything?

Now what does the counselor say? In any other civilization, the counselor would say, that's just not true. There's plenty of reason.

This is not all there is. There's right, there's wrong, there's God, there's eternity, there's, you know what they would say. But the counselor can't say anything to him because he's right, however he's also crazy.

And if you persist in that, in this society, we'll call him crazy, why? GK Chesterton said, in our society, insanity, insane people are not illogical. In our society, insane people are only logical.

In other words, this little boy was saying, I understand finally from school what life's about. There's no answers. Everything's going to burn up.

Nobody means anything. In the end, it makes no difference what I do. Everything's going to be over.

See, he's being logical and that's why it's on the verge of being put away. Because you see, there's nobody out. There's never been a civilization that had a set of non-answers to the basic questions.

Every other society, though, they may be, maybe they're wrong. I mean, for my viewpoint, as a Christian, some of them definitely are wrong. But at least they were there.

And therefore, there was no, there was no danger of people going insane by simply logically taking out what the culture says about the reality. This little boy is ready to go crazy. So what do they say to him?

What do you say to anybody that starts talking like that? Lighting up. Eat an ice cream cone, play a game of ball.

If he was a little older, they say, you know, go out, kiss a girl, have sex, climb a mountain, look at the view. You know, smell the roses. Come on.

Now what are they saying? Now that just sounds like, yeah, yeah, you know what it is. They're turning to pleasure for what?

Look at verse three, for a sense of being worthwhile. The reason in our society, when you don't have anything bigger than yourself to live for, when you don't know what truth is, when you have no cause worth dying for, you're not dying for your family, you're not dying for the truth, you're not dying for nation, you're not dying for God. You know, there is nothing bigger than you, therefore there are no answers to the questions.

What do we do? Since there's no objective meaning, we try to manufacture subjective meaning. Because our wisdom shows us that things are meaningless, therefore we turn to pleasure.

But we're not pleasure now becomes very complicated. We expect pleasure. We see a promise here that is much, there's more going on here than pleasure.

In our society, by and large, we are not just going after pleasure. I mean, rats go after pleasure. Rats have sex and it's just about sex.

But when we have sex, it's not just the physical experience, also what starts to happen. You start to say, I'm loved, I'm valued, my life is worthwhile. See, that's what verse three is about.

He turned to pleasure, not for pleasure. He turned to pleasure to deal with the fact that he had nothing bigger to live for. And he wasn't looking just for pleasure.

He wasn't looking just for sex. He was looking that he wanted to have that, I know this is on tape. There's a physical orgasm, there's a spiritual orgasm.

The physical is a matter of certain chemicals hitting the hypothalamus. But the spiritual is to say, life is worthwhile, my life, there's love. All right, Bernstein says, when he listens to Beethoven's fifth, he doesn't just tap his feet.

You listen to music, you can't help it. There's a physical thing about music, you listen to music, what is that? What's going on there?

Physical, it's neurological. Neurological system is... You're on the tape, I just made funny, rhythmic, you know, I don't know what the people on the tape are going to figure what you're laughing at, I was just sort of making funny rhythmic movements, okay.

I'm just trying to be thoughtful. Beethoven says, pardon me, Bernstein says, when I hear Beethoven, I feel that something is right in the world, something is right in the universe, something checks out, something that obeys its own laws consistently, something that will never let us down. You know that quote, one of my favorite quotes, but what is he saying?

My life is worthwhile, I was reading, back in July, there was a New York Times magazine article called Lux Populi, not Vox Populi, and it was about the fact that luxury items are being sold, very expensive luxury items, instead of just being sold to people who live in just a few rich people someplace, they're being sold everywhere, people are putting out an incredible amount of money for luxury items, and at one point one of the people who makes these luxury items was being interviewed and said, they asked, you know, look, okay, your sweaters are 20 times more expensive than the next sweater, are your sweaters really 20 times better than the next competitor? And what does he say? He said, we sell dreams, he explained, when you see one of our boutiques and you go in and you buy lipstick or you buy this or that, it has the dream in it, now what is he saying?

What a nice euphemistic way of putting it, but he's right, there's something more than pleasure going on here, there's something more than the feel of probably, you know, his sweaters probably are incredibly comfortable, but there's something much different, just like it's sex is not about sex now, and music is not about music, what he's really saying is you buy that sweater so you know, my life is worthwhile, you're manufacturing subjective meaning, but let us be clear what's going on. In a society that has no objective meaning, there is going to be a kind of freneticness about pleasure, and really, I'm not sure we can ever say that there has ever been a society, I mean society has always had its pleasures, but has there ever been a society that puts the metabolism and entertainment into sexual activity, into material, you know, luxuries that we do, there's never been one, maybe the Greco-Roman world as it was beginning to fall apart, but that's also because just like the Ecclesiastes guy says here, it was because they had lost their ability to believe in any objective meaning, and so they had to turn, and therefore they turned to pleasure, not just for pleasure, but a sense of worth wildness. Now, before I move on, you understand, let me apply this to you personally, what does it mean to live a life of pleasure?

A lot of you don't think you're doing it, because you see, one of the things here is in the very beginning and it says, laughter is foolish, see verse two, and what's this pleasure accomplished. After in pleasure, two Hebrew words, they're not really synonyms. Laughter really means a kind of orgy.

Laughter means to lose your discernment, whereas pleasure, the second word, has more of a sense of refinement aesthetics, and you see, one is a whole heart, full-throated party in orgy, the other is refinement. One is get smashed, the other one is buy art, but let me tell you, he is saying, they are the same, they are the same. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share the hope, enjoy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Watch your copy today at gospelenlife.com slash give that's gospelenlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. When it comes right down to it, I don't know whether you are having a lot of sex or whether you just have a job that you hate because it's not doing anything productive for anybody but it's making enough money so that someday you'll be able to do the things you want to do. That's the same thing as a person who's partying all the time.

You see there's a downtown and the uptown approach to hedonism but you see there's Oprah Winfrey and there's Jerry Springer but it's the same. What is the bottom line in your life? Do you have anything worth dying for?

Do you have anything that you'd go to the mat for? Is there any truth that this is the bottom line? So really is it comfort, affluence?

Is it good feeling? Is it sensory pleasure? If you do that, you're not doing it just for pleasure.

You're looking to get a life. You're looking to get a sense of worth wellness and it's going to fail. That's the second point.

这段是唯一一本从寻找者的视角撰写的书。当你进行灵性探索时，总会遇到一些事情。上一周，我们探讨了《传道书》作者提到的一个问题，那就是痛苦。面对痛苦怎么办？

如何解决痛苦的问题？有一本书专门讨论这个问题——《痛苦的难题》。事实上，有很多书都在讨论世界上的邪恶、苦难和不公。但本周我们要面对的是你作为灵性探索者需要处理的另一个问题，寻找者。

他提到了这一点，并进行了探讨，这是他说的话。我们来读一读。《传道书》2:1-11。稍后的一个章节，第三章10到14节，我会一起读给你们听。

于是我在心里想：现在我要用享乐来测试自己，看看什么是好的，但这也证明是徒劳的。当我问自己这是否愚蠢时，享乐又能做些什么？我尝试用酒来麻醉自己，并拥抱愚昧。我的理智仍然指导着我，我希望找到值得人类在天地上做的事情，在短暂的生命中。

我从事了许多伟大的事业。我建了房子，种了葡萄园。我还建造花园和公园，并种植各种果树。我修建水池灌溉茂盛的树木。

我还买了男奴女奴，也有出生在我家里的奴隶。我也拥有比耶路撒冷以前任何人都多的牛羊群。我积累了大量的银子和黄金，以及国王和省份的财宝。我还拥有了男女歌手和后宫，还有心灵所渴望的一切欢乐。

我在所有方面都超过了耶路撒冷以前的人，我的智慧也一直伴随着我。我没有拒绝自己任何东西，我的眼睛所见，我的心没有拒绝任何快乐，我的心对我的工作感到满意，这就是我辛勤劳动的回报。然而，当我回顾我用手所做的和我努力取得的一切时，一切都变得毫无意义，就像追逐风一样，在太阳底下没有什么收获。我看到了上帝给世人带来的负担。

他把万事都看为美好，各有权时。神也安排人世世代代的心中都有永恒的观念，但人不能明白神从起初直到如今所作的事。我知道，人最好的事就是行善，在一生中欢欢喜喜地度日；吃喝，并在他劳碌所得的一切上享福。这是神的恩赐。

我知道，神所做的事都永存不废，其间没有增添也没有减缺。神这样做是要人敬畏他。那么另一个问题是什么？我说过有一个痛苦的问题，但当你去观察生活时，还有一个问题存在。

我们通常不会把它当作一个问题来看待，但它确实是一个精神上的问题。你看，当面对邪恶和苦难时，我们会看到痛苦。这是一个上周我们讨论过的巨大谜团，但在其中也有指向神的线索。然而，本周我们要探讨的是快乐的问题。

不是痛苦的问题。你们知道，我知道这一点。如果我跟人谈论神，你觉得神是什么样的？我对神有一个问题。

这个问题是什么？是痛苦、邪恶和苦难。我从未真正遇到过一个说，哦，我相信神也没什么问题的人。为什么呢？

快乐。世界上为什么会存在快乐？为什么快乐会是那样的方式？今晚我的脸和你的脸都应该是让你感到不安的，因为快乐是一个巨大的谜团。

对于你们中的一些人来说，这个谜团可能已经很明显了，你们知道谁是你们自己。快乐是一个谜题。快乐是一个问题，并且在其中有很多指向的东西。现在他在这里教给我们三件事：第一，快乐承诺什么；第二，它为什么会失败；第三，它如何指向更远的地方。

好？这基本上是他贯穿始终、在每一个主题中所做的事，但其中有什么承诺？为什么失败了？又是如何指向更远的地方的？

首先，它给了我们什么承诺。在第1节到第3节中，这里的内容真的非常引人入胜。他说：“我心想，现在来测试一下享乐，看看什么是好的。” 于是，我用酒使自己高兴，与荒谬的行为结合，想看看世人可以在地上、在这短暂的生命里做些什么是值得的。

这很重要。注意他用了“现在”这个词。他并没有直接进入他的项目——直到现在为止都追求享乐。那么，在此之前发生了什么？

你看，他在第一章中已经经历了一些事情，我没有打印出来给你们看，我们现在也没有在前面，让我读给你们听。他已经经历过一些事，然后转向了享乐。理解他说的话非常重要。在第一章中，他说：“我专心应用智慧，考察、探究天下所做的一切事。

”但当他看到天底下一切的事时，他发现一切都是虚空的，是追逐风一般的东西；因为智慧越多，痛苦就越多，知识越丰富，悲伤就越深重。现在，看看他做了什么。他一开始并没有决定追求享乐。他说：“我要用我的头脑去观察生活，找出生活的意义和目的，真正弄清楚生命是什么、为什么会有那样的事发生。

”记得吗？我读给你们听，并且我们上周也提到过，他说：“我试图理解在天底下生活。” “天底下”这个词，在《传道书》中他反复使用，他告诉我们，他像一个务实的世俗人那样看待生活。他就像约翰·列侬所说的，想象一下，没有天堂、地狱或永恒，只有今天的生活，为了今天而活。

他说：“如果这就是我们所拥有的，我们不知道之前是什么，也不知道之后会怎样。” 如果这就是全部，他去那里就是为了弄清楚生命的意义。那么，他决定、确定、得出的结论是什么呢？他得出的结论是：如果这 life 就是我们拥有的全部，那么就没有答案可以回答那些大问题。

如果这 life 是我们拥有的全部，那么就没有答案可以回答那些大问题，那我们在这里是为了什么呢？我们为了什么而存在？我们的目的是什么？什么是正确和错误？

绝对的道德标准是什么？什么是真理？当我们去世后会去哪里？没有答案。

而这正是他转向享乐的时候。现在这一点非常重要。当他审视生命并得出结论说没有答案时，然后转向享乐，这实际上反映了西方历史的发展过程。首先，你应该知道我们这些生活在美利坚合众国的人，你们正在经历所谓的西方社会，虽然范围已经超越了美国和欧洲，因为有科技的因素在起作用。

但在西方社会中，我们的文化领袖整体上都已经说出了这句话：没有答案。要知道，从来没有任何一个社会是建立在某种宗教或哲学之上，然后宣称这里就有答案的。可能是佛教、神道教、伊斯兰教、基督教、犹太教等等，但这是我们第一次真正地说出这种话。甚至我可以说，关于共产主义呢？

不，抱歉，共产主义也是有答案的。他们知道历史的方向，知道你应该做什么，他们明白这一点，对吧？他们给出了答案。现在，这些可能都不同，你知道，它们互相矛盾，不可能全都正确。

但这里有一个关键点：只有一个人说，没有答案。这就是我们拥有的全部。当我们去世后，我们不知道为什么在这里。而我们在这种基础上建立文明。

那么当你这样做时会发生什么呢？让我告诉你，我来给你举个例子。实际上我们这里正好有一个小片段，但我再给你讲一个。在电影《无线电时代》中，我想这个名字就是这么来的。

电影一开始，一个男孩去上科学课。他去上课，听到一些东西后就心烦意乱、忧郁不已，简直要疯了。母亲不得不把他带到咨询师那里坐下，咨询师问：“出了什么事？”小男孩大约八九岁，已经一个星期或两周左右发现这件事了，他说：“你知道吗？

宇宙在膨胀。” 你意识到最终一切都会燃烧殆尽吗？你会意识到一切都将结束吗？那做任何事情还有什么意义呢？

那么咨询师怎么说呢？在其他文明中，咨询师会说：“这不对。有很多理由可以解释的。” 这不是全部。

有对与错，有上帝，有永恒。他们会这么说。但是这个咨询师不能对他说什么，因为他说得没错，但他也是疯了。如果他坚持这样想，在现代社会，我们会称他为疯子，为什么呢？

GK切斯特顿说过，在我们的社会里，疯子不是不讲逻辑的人。在我们的社会里，疯子只是讲逻辑而已。换句话说，这个小男孩终于从学校里明白了生活的真谛：没有答案。一切都会燃烧殆尽。

没有人有意义。到最后，无论我做什么都无关紧要。一切都将结束。你看，他很讲逻辑，这就是为什么几乎要被送走的原因。

因为你知道，在我们的社会中，从来就没有一个文明能够给出基本问题的非答案。其他每一个社会可能都是错的。从我的基督教观点来看，其中一些肯定错了。但至少他们有他们的答案。

因此，人们不会仅仅通过逻辑地剔除文化对现实的说法而变得疯狂。这个小男孩已经准备好要疯了。那么对他们说什么呢？你对开始这样说话的人怎么说？

给他买个冰淇淋，玩一场球赛。如果他年纪大一点，他们会说：“去吧，找一个女孩亲吻，发生关系，爬一座山，看看风景。”“闻一闻玫瑰花香。”来吧。

（原文中的英文部分保持不变） 现在他们在说什么？这听起来不就是，嗯，你知道的。他们转向享乐是为了什么？看看第三节，为了找到生活的意义。

在我们的社会里，当你没有什么比自己更重要的东西去追求时，当你不知道什么是真理，没有值得为之牺牲的理由，不是为了家庭，不是为了真理，不是为了国家，也不是为了上帝。你认为没有什么比自己更大的东西，所以也就没有问题的答案。那我们该怎么办？既然没有客观的意义，我们就试图制造主观的意义。

因为我们知道一切都没有意义，所以我们转向享乐。但我们的享乐变得非常复杂。我们期待着享乐。这里有一个承诺，不仅仅是享乐，还有更多。

在我们的社会中，我们不仅仅追求享乐。老鼠追求的是享乐。老鼠交配只是为了性。但我们的人类却不只是为了性。

当我们交配时，不仅仅是身体上的体验，还会发生一些事情。你会开始觉得被爱、有价值，生活是有意义的。这就是第三节的意思。他转向了享乐，不是为了享乐本身。

他转向了享乐来应对自己没有什么更重要的东西可以追求的事实。他不只是在寻找享乐。他不只是在寻找性，而是想要那种感觉——我知道这个录音带里说了。有身体上的高潮，也有精神上的高潮。

身体的高潮是某些化学物质刺激下丘脑的结果。但精神上的高潮则是说，生活是有意义的，我的生命中有爱。伯恩斯坦说，当他听贝多芬第五交响曲时，并不只是跟着打拍子。当你听音乐时，你无法控制自己。

音乐有物理层面的影响，你听音乐时，那是什么？发生了什么？物理上来说，这是神经系统的反应。神经系统是……你在录音带里，我只是做了些有趣的、有节奏的动作，你知道的，我不知道录音带上的人会笑什么，我只是在做有趣而有节奏的动作，好的。

> 我只是想表达一些思考。贝多芬说过，不，是伯恩斯坦说的，当我听到贝多芬的作品时，我感到世界上有些事情是对的，宇宙中有些事情是对的，有些东西符合它自己的规律，并且始终如一，永远不会让我们失望。你知道那句话，这是我最喜欢的名言之一，但他到底在说什么呢？我的生活是有意义的，我在七月读过一篇《纽约时报》杂志的文章，题目是 Lux Populi（不是 Vox Populi），文章提到奢侈品正在被销售，非常昂贵的奢侈品，并不仅仅卖给少数富人，而是遍布各地。

人们愿意花大量的钱购买奢侈品，在某个时刻，一位制作这些奢侈品的人在接受采访时说，他们问，你知道吗，你的毛衣比其他品牌的贵20倍，但你的毛衣真的比竞争对手好20倍吗？他怎么说的呢？他说我们卖的是梦想，他解释道，当你看到我们的精品店并进去购买口红或其他商品时，你买到的就是那个梦想。那么他在说什么呢？

这真是一个委婉的说法，但他说得没错，这里不仅仅是享乐，还有更多。不仅仅是因为他的毛衣可能非常舒适，而是有更深层次的东西。就像性不只是关于性，音乐也不只是关于音乐一样，他真正想说的是，你买这件毛衣是为了知道我的生活是有意义的，你在制造主观的意义，但我们必须清楚地认识到发生了什么。在一个没有客观意义的社会里，享乐会变得异常狂热，我真的不确定我们是否可以说曾经有过这样的社会。

当然，社会总是有它的乐趣，但有没有一个社会像我们现在这样将新陈代谢和娱乐融入性行为、物质享受中？从来没有过，或许在罗马帝国开始衰落时的希腊-罗马世界是如此，但这也是因为他们失去了任何客观意义的能力，所以他们转向了享乐，不仅是寻求享乐，更是为了找到一种价值感。现在，在我继续之前，请允许我把这个应用到你个人身上，生活中的享乐意味着什么？你们中很多人觉得自己并没有这样做，因为这里一开始就说笑是愚蠢的，看第二节经文，这享乐到底带来了什么成就。

在这两节经文中，两个希伯来词并不是同义词。笑实际上是一种狂欢，而第二个词则更多地带有审美和精致的感觉。你看，一个是全心全意、放声大笑的狂欢，另一个是精致。一个是你喝醉了，另一个是你买艺术品，但我要告诉你，他说的是同一个意思，它们本质上是一样的。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是关于那个迷途的弟弟。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是想对那些逃避上帝的人和那些试图通过做好人来赚取祂爱的人说些什么。在《浪子的神》一书中，提摩太·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事如何揭示福音的核心信息——一个既为悖逆的小儿子也为严厉的大儿子带来希望的信息，并且向所有人发出邀请，让他们体验上帝慷慨非凡的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，这本书都能帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。

浪子的神是你们本月赠礼对我们的一项感谢，这份礼物旨在帮助“生命中的福音”分享耶稣仁慈而不懈的爱带给全世界人们的希望和喜乐。今天就访问 gospelenlife.com/give 来领取你的副本吧。现在，请听提摩太·凯勒带来的今日教导的其余部分。归根结底，我不知道你是否在频繁地发生性行为，还是仅仅有一份虽然没有多大意义但却能让你赚到足够钱以实现梦想的工作。

这和一个整日狂欢的人是一样的道理。你看，享乐主义有两种模式——市中心派和郊区派；有奥普拉·温弗瑞也有杰里·斯普林格，但它们本质上是相同的。你生命中的底线是什么？你有没有值得为之赴死的东西？

你有没有为了它而拼尽全力的信念？**真正的问题是**：舒适、富裕、感觉良好还是感官上的愉悦吗？如果你这样做，那不是单纯为了享受。你是在寻求一种生活，一种价值感和健康感，而这注定会失败。

这是第二个要点。

## 享乐为何失败 / Why Pleasure Fails

The first point is what it promises, the second point he gives us and shows us is it fails and it explains why. Now, one of the things it's important to understand and boy, this is very powerful. This is not a regular guy.

No, it isn't. First 10, I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. Now what's that?

I denied myself nothing, my eyes desired. Now there's only 99.99% of people cannot say that. All of us deny ourselves all sorts of things our eyes desire, mainly because we don't have the money or the power to take them.

And because of that, most of us are going down this path and pleasure is our bottom line and it is the main thing we're living for, even though by and large, unless we're party hearty types, we kind of really, really hide that from ourselves. I'm trying to reveal this to some of you here tonight. But he said, if you're going down that path and you're empty, instead of saying there's something wrong with the path, we have a tendency to say it's because I haven't gone far enough.

If I could build that house in the lake, if I could have a better love life, if I could just lose weight, in other words, because you haven't gone far enough down, that's the reason why you feel like you're empty. You're blaming yourself when it's the path. And what's so very powerful about this, when he is depicting himself as the greatest, the greatest, one of the 0.001% who actually was able to do anything he wanted to satisfy any sensory pleasure.

Now somebody says, well, how do I know that really happened? You kind of made me wonder, is this person really a king or was he taken the role of a king? It doesn't matter.

Here's what he's trying to say. I challenge you. Look at the lives of the people who are in that 0.001%.

Read their biographies, read their interviews. They found exactly what he has. They're just not, the reason they're so unhappy and the reason they're so jevastated is they're not living in the avail of illusion that we are, because they got to the end of the road and there was a dead end.

And we're empty, but we say, well, if I only got further down, well, they got down there. That's the reason why they're so unhappy. They're not happy because they're rich.

They're unhappy because they got to the end of the road. And they saw, they were still just them. It's a powerful argument for the fact that pleasure ultimately fails us.

Not that it fails to deliver the orgasm. Not that it fails to deliver the neurological rhythm. Not that it fails to deliver the comfort of the nice sweater, but it fails to deliver worth-wildness.

It fails to give you what you're really looking for in that is transcendence. We are looking for a way to do an in-run around the fact we have nothing to live for. We have nothing solid.

We have nothing we're sure of. We have nothing that's going to take us to the stars. We have nothing that we think will last past us, to see.

We're looking for transcendence, and it will fail at that. Utterly fail. In two ways, number one, pleasure will fail to distract you.

In verse three, he says, my mind was still guided you with wisdom. He said, I tried cheering myself with wine and bracing folly, but my mind was still guiding me. Down in verse nine, he says, I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem.

In all this, my wisdom stayed with me. What is that? What's he talking about?

I'll tell you what he's talking about. This is one of my, as some of you know, one of my favorite quotes from C. S.

Lewis. What he's trying to say is, no matter how hard I tried, through pleasure to forget the fact that I had nothing to live for and nothing means anything, I tried and it broke through. Pleasure.

See, subjective pleasure, trying to talk to wipe out the lack of objective pleasure is like trying to butter too much bread with too little butter. You know, you spread it and by the time the knife gets to the end, there's no butter there. I mean, it wasn't enough butter, it just sunk in.

And in the same way, subjective pleasure fails because no matter how hard he tried to stop thinking, his wisdom stayed with and the truth kept coming through, you know. If your life, if your origin is an accident and your destiny is just rot, if your life, if your origin is insignificant and your destiny is insignificant, have the guts to admit your life is insignificant. Well, now that thought, we try to keep away, but is what Lewis says.

He says, let us suppose that nature is all that exists. This meaningless play of atoms and space in time by a series of a hundred chances has regrettably produced things like ourselves, conscious beings who now know that their own consciousness is an accidental result of the whole meaningless process and is therefore self-meaningless, though to us, alas, we feel significant. In this situation, you might decide to simply have as good time as possible, right?

Say, hey, life is meaningless. Let's have a great time. Why not?

What difference does it make? I might as well have these great feelings. You might decide to have as good a time as possible, but you can't accept it now, listen.

You can't accept in the lowest animal sense. Maybe in love with a girl if you know and you remember that your view of the world means that all the beauties of her person and her character are a momentary and accidental pattern produced by the collision of atoms and your own response to them is only a sort of psychic chemical phosphorescence, arising from the behavior of your genetic material, and you can't go on getting very serious pleasure for music if you know and remember that its air significance is a pure illusion that you like it only because your nervous system is irrationally conditioned to like it. Yes, you may still in the lowest sense of a good time, but just in so far as it becomes very good, just in so far as it ever threatens to push you from cold sensuality on into real warmth and real enthusiasm and real joy, so far will you be forced to feel the hopeless disharmony between your own emotions and the universe in which you think you really live.

It will break through. As time goes on, even if it's unconscious or semi-conscious, the fact that you've got nothing to live for, the wisdom breaks through. It creates a grimness, it creates a joylessness no matter how much pleasure you try to take, but not only does pleasure fail to distract us from the lack of objective reality, but secondly, it fails to satisfy.

Because down in verse 11, at the climax, he says, I looked at it all and everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind, that was chasing after the wind. Wind is something you can't keep. Wind can be a wonderful experience, but you can't keep it, you can't say, ah, let me grab that thing so I can have that wind tomorrow, it can't be done.

Now on the physical and spiritual level, see, here's what's frightening, I said, that especially in our society, what's really going on when we seek pleasure is we're not after just the physical sensory pleasure, we're after transcendence, we're after worth wildness. Well, first of all, one of the most awful things to know, and addiction counselors will tell you this, is that pleasurable agents, at first give you a rush, but then there's a tolerance factor, pleasurable agents at, you know, A amount, you know, five liters of such a pleasurable agent will give you a great, great experience the first time, but the next time it'll take a little more to get the same amount of experience, the same amount of pleasure. And next time a little bit more, next time a little bit more because we adapt and pleasurable agents wear off in their ability to create pleasure.

And that's how addictions happen. You need more and you need more and you need more and if you're lucky, you can break it off before it completely destroys you and then you just be empty. And that's physical pleasure, physical pleasure is like the wind, it just doesn't stay.

If you give it, if you really rely on it, not if you enjoy it, but if you just rely on it, if you go to it for transcendence, especially it cannot deliver. And Lewis, of course, has some classic stuff about the fact that it's not just physically the pleasure we can't hold on to, but spiritually it disappoints us in this way. He says in one of his more famous quotes, he says, all of your life, there's been an unattainable ecstasy that's hovered just beyond the grasp of your consciousness.

The loft on the verge of breaking through, you know, when you're in a boat or when you're falling in love, you know, when he says, he says, when you're starting into a pleasurable experience, you think, ah, finally, I'll be worth this is it, somehow this is it. He says off on the verge of breaking through and yet you've never had it. All the things that have ever deeply possessed you, your soul, have been but hints of it, tantalizing glimpses, promises never quite fulfilled, echoes that died away just as they were caught year-year.

It's the secret signature of each soul. With the incomunicable and unappeasable want, the thing we desire before we met our wives or made our friends or chose our work and which we shall still desire on our deathbeds when the mind is no longer knowing wife or friend or work. The books of the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust in them.

It was not in them, it only comes through them. If they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshipers. For they are not the thing itself, they are only the scent of the flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.

It gets a music we are born remembering. There's a music we're born remembering, we're trying to hear in music. There's a scent we're born remembering, we're trying to smell in the flower.

Now, what is that? I believe that even though how do you prove it, I can prove it just by saying it. We know that this is true, that that sense of transcendence does not come through.

As he said, the best marriage is the best career is the best houses, in fact, people who get to the very end of the road find it hasn't got their other ones that know the best. Those of us who don't have these wonderful pleasures, we're still in the avail of illusion we think, if only, no.

第一个要点是它所承诺的内容，第二个要点则是它如何展示这一切并解释其原因。现在有一件事非常重要且非常有力需要理解——这可不是一个普通人能做到的。首先，我什么都没拒绝过，我的眼睛也没有错过任何东西。

那是什么意思？（原文中的比喻和对话保持不变） 我什么都没有拒绝，我的眼睛所渴望的也没有得到。现在只有99.99%的人能做到这一点。我们所有人都在拒绝自己眼睛所渴望的一切，主要是因为我们没有足够的钱或权力去拥有它们。

正因为如此，大多数人都在这条道路上前行，快乐成了我们的底线，是我们生活的全部，尽管大多数人除非是狂热派对者，否则都会尽量隐藏这种想法。今晚我试图向你们揭示这一点。但他曾说：“如果你走在那条路上却感到空虚，不要认为问题出在路本身上，我们往往会认为只是因为走得还不够远。” 如果我能建起湖边的房子，如果我的爱情生活更好，如果我能减肥成功，换句话说，因为你还没有走足够远，所以你才会觉得空虚。

你责怪自己，其实问题是出在这条路上。而他描绘自己为最伟大的人之一——0.001%中真正能够满足任何感官快乐的人——这一点非常有力。有人可能会问：我怎么知道这真的发生过？这让我有些怀疑，这个人是真的国王还是只是扮演了国王的角色？

这些都不重要。他想表达的是：我向你们挑战。看看那0.001%中人们的生活。读一读他们的传记，听听他们的访谈。

你会发现他们确实拥有一切，但正是因为他们到了路的尽头发现是个死胡同，所以他们才会如此不快乐和失望。我们感到空虚，却说如果再走远一点就好了，但他们已经到达了那个终点。这就是为什么他们会如此不快乐的原因。他们并不因为富有而快乐；他们不快乐是因为他们到了路的尽头，发现自己还是原来的自己。

这是一个强有力的论点，证明最终快乐会让我们失望。不是因为它无法带来高潮，不是因为它无法带来神经的节奏感，也不是因为它无法带来舒适的毛衣带来的安慰，而是它无法带来真正值得追求的东西。它不能给你你真正渴望的那种超越。我们都在寻找一种方法来绕过那个事实——即我们没有活着的理由。

我们没有坚实的东西。我们没有什么可以确信的，也没有什么能带我们飞向星辰。没有什么我们认为会延续到我们之后的事物。我们在寻找那种超越感，而它将彻底失败。

以两种方式失败：首先，快乐无法让你分心。在箴言第三章中，他说：“我的理智仍然引导我。”他说道：“我试图用酒来振奋自己，用愚昧来支撑自己，但我的理智仍然指引着我。”到了第九节，他又说：“我在一切上都比耶路撒冷的众人更胜一筹。

在我这一切之上，我的智慧与我同在。” 那是什么意思？他在说什么？让我告诉你他在说什么。

这可能是你们中的一些人知道的一个我喜欢引用的C.S.刘易斯的名言之一。他想说的是，无论我多么努力地试图通过快乐来忘记自己没有活着的理由和一切都没有意义的事实，我都尝试过，但事实还是破晓了。主观的快乐无法解决问题，就像用太少的黄油涂太多面包一样。你涂抹开来，到刀子到达末端时，那里已经没有黄油了。

也就是说，黄油不够，它只是沉下去了。同样地，主观的快乐也会失败，因为无论他多么努力不去思考，他的智慧仍然伴随着他，真相依然显现出来。如果你的生活、你的起源是偶然的，而你的命运仅仅是腐朽，如果你的生活和你的起源都是微不足道的，那么就勇敢地承认你的生活是微不足道的。现在这个想法是我们试图避开的，但这就是刘易斯所说的。

他说，让我们假设只有自然界存在。这一系列偶然事件在时间和空间中的无意义的原子游戏竟然产生了像我们这样的有意识生命体，而我们现在知道自己的意识是整个无意义过程的一个偶然结果，因此本身也是自相矛盾的。然而，对我们来说，不幸的是，我们却觉得有意义。在这种情况下，你可能会决定尽可能地享受生活。

说吧，生活是无意义的，让我们尽情享受吧。为什么不呢？这有什么区别吗？我大可以有这些美好的感觉。

你可以决定尽可能享受生活，但你现在不能接受它，听我说。你无法在最低层次上接受这一点。也许当你爱上一个女孩时，如果你知道并记得你的世界观意味着她所有的美丽和个性都是原子碰撞产生的短暂且偶然的模式，而你对她的反应只是一种心理化学磷光，源于你遗传物质的行为，那么你就不能从音乐中获得**真正的快乐，因为你知道并记得它的真正意义是**一个纯粹的幻觉，你喜欢它仅仅是因为你的神经系统无理地被条件反射成这样。是的，在最低层次上，你可能仍然可以尽情享受，但只要它变得越好，只要它开始威胁要将你从冷淡的感官中拉入真正的热情和真正的喜悦之中，你就不得不感到自己情感与你认为真正生活的宇宙之间的绝望不和谐。

这种矛盾会突破。随着时间的推移，即使是在无意识或半意识的情况下，你没有活着的理由的事实也会显现出来。智慧会突破，无论你尝试获得多少快乐，它都会创造一种阴郁感和无欢感。不仅仅是快乐无法分散我们对客观现实缺失的关注，而且其次，它也无法满足我们的需求。

因为在第11节的高潮处，他这样说：“我审视了一切，发现一切都是虚空，是追求风影。风是你无法抓住的东西。风可以是一种美妙的经历，但你不能抓住它，不能说：啊，让我抓住那东西，明天还能享受同样的风。那是不可能的。

” 现在从物理和灵性的层面来看，这里最可怕的是，在我们的社会中，当我们寻求快乐时，并不仅仅是追求感官上的快乐，我们更是在追求超越、追求意义。首先，最糟糕的事情之一是，成瘾咨询师会告诉你，愉快物质起初能给你带来快感，但随后就会产生耐受性。比如，某种愉快物质在A剂量下第一次使用时，可以带给你极佳的体验，但第二次就可能需要稍微多一点才能达到同样的效果，第三次、第四次则需要更多，因为我们会适应，而愉快物质也会逐渐失去创造快乐的能力。这就是成瘾是如何发生的：你需要越来越多，如果你幸运的话，在它完全摧毁你之前能戒掉，否则你就只能空虚。

物理上的快乐就像风一样，不会停留。如果你真的依赖它，而不是仅仅享受它，如果你用它来寻求超越，尤其是它无法兑现这一点。当然，刘易斯也有过一些经典的论述，他说：“你们一生中都有一种可望而不可即的狂喜，在意识之外飘荡。” 船即将破晓，你知道，在船上摇晃或是陷入爱河时，当他说，他说，当你开始享受一段愉悦的经历时，你会想：啊，终于来了，我值得这一切。

仿佛这一刻就是一切的答案。他就在那破晓的边缘说，但你却从未真正拥有过它。所有曾经深深触动你的灵魂的事物，都只是它的暗示、诱惑人心的一瞥和未能兑现的承诺，就像回声在消失前就已消散。这是每个灵魂的秘密签名。

这种无法言说且永不满足的渴望，在我们遇见伴侣或结交朋友之前就已经存在，并且即使在临终之际，当心智不再记得妻子、朋友或工作时，这种渴望依旧存在。我们在书中寻找的美，如果过于依赖它们，最终会让我们失望。因为那并不是**真正的美，只是**透过它们所散发出的香气，是未找到的花朵，是未曾听到的旋律，是从未到访过的国度。我们生来就记得某种音乐，我们试图在音乐中寻回它；我们生来就记得某种香气，我们试图在花香中捕捉它。

那么，那是什么呢？我相信即使无法证明，只要我说出来就能证明这一点。我们知道这种超越感并不是通过这些方式获得的。正如他说过的，最好的婚姻、最好的事业和最好的住所其实都不是答案。

那些真正走到终点的人会发现，它们并没有他们所期待的答案。我们中的许多人虽然没有享受到这些美妙的快乐，但我们仍然在幻觉中挣扎，以为如果只有……不，为什么呢？为什么快乐不够？为什么我们要追求更多？

## 永恒在人心中 / Eternity in Our Hearts

Well, why would this be?

Why isn't pleasure enough? Why do we want to go beyond? Well, here's the pointer in chapter three.

It says, and there's a lot more in chapter three, but we just can't go into it all tonight. He says, he has made everything beautiful in his time. He has also said eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.

Now that's something pretty interesting. Take a look at this. First of all, he says there's all sorts of beautiful things out there.

In fact, if you want to know the definition of a pleasure, it's beauty. Do you want to know the definition of beauty? A beauty is something.

Something is beautiful rather than instrumental. Something is beautiful if it's pleasurable in itself, just for itself. You see, if you studied art because you had to get an A in a class, and then as soon as the class was over, you never went to see art.

Art is fine. Okay. It's just instrumental.

It's not beautiful. But if afterwards you would go when you didn't have to, when it doesn't get you anywhere as a matter of fact, it costs you money. You see, something is beautiful rather than instrumental.

Something is beautiful when it gives you pleasure just because of your delight in it, just to see it, just to let it be there, just to put it on your eyes, on your tongue, on your ear, on your heart. That's what something is. It's beautiful.

But we have seen that there's something wrong because the beautiful things that we set our hearts on, addict us, and yet at the same time, they don't satisfy us. Why? Well, it's the second clause.

He has put eternity in the hearts of men. That's almost a unique verse in the Bible. He has put endlessness in our hearts.

What that means is that there is a desire for an eternal beauty, and that all the beauties that are here, if we set our hearts on them, as Lewis said, they disappoint us because they are only the scent of the flower we haven't smelled. They're only the hint, the echo of a tune we haven't really heard. You know, if there's a music we're born remembering, well, what is it?

Well, in general, it's the face of God. Psalm 16, verse 11, in thy face is fullness of joy in thy right hand, their pleasures for evermore. Psalm 27, verse 4.

One thing, that's an addict. One thing do I seek after. One thing do I ask for to gaze on the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.

Now, in general, this is a challenge to everybody. If this is true, a lot of people are in trouble. A lot of you have said, I believe in God, fine, why?

Can I ask you why? I believe in God. Why?

Okay. Well, what do you do about it? Well, I go to church, or I obey to think commandments.

Why? Because I ought to. Why?

Let me keep pushing you. In the end, there's only two, see Christians, real Christians whose lives have been changed, and whose attitude toward pleasures is so different because we can enjoy them. We're not afraid of them now, but on the other hand, they are not the main thing, so they don't addict us either.

The difference between a Christian whose life has really been changed, and a religious person is this, religious people find God useful, instrumental, and Christians are people who have finally found them beautiful, who obey Him just because of who He is. Wouldn't care what else it brought them, just for the delight. You see, religious people and Christians, they share obedience, religious people and Christians may be desperate for God.

They might be obedient to God, so they may have all sorts of awe and reverence to God, but the difference between a Christian and just a religious person and a nice person is that they find them useful, but Christians find them beautiful, that you come after Him and you seek Him and you obey Him because of the beauty of who He is. Has that been true of you? Have you experienced that?

这里有一个线索，在第三章里。它说，整章还有很多内容，但今晚我们无法一一细讲。他说，在他所管理的时期，一切都很美好。他也说过，人心中存着永恒，然而人却不能完全领悟神从头到尾所做的事。

这确实很有趣。让我们来看看。首先，他说世界上有很多美好的事物。事实上，如果你想知道什么是快乐，那就是美。

你想知道美的定义吗？美就是某样东西。某样东西之所以美丽，并不是因为它有用，而是因为它本身就能带来快乐，只是为了存在而存在。你看，如果你学艺术只是因为要得个好成绩，等到课程结束后就再也不去看艺术了。

艺术固然不错。好吧，它只是有用的工具。那就不算美。但如果之后你还是愿意去欣赏，即使这不会给你带来实际的好处，甚至还会花钱，你知道为什么吗？

某样东西之所以美丽，并不是因为它有用。某样东西之所以美丽，是因为它能带给我们纯粹的快乐，只是为了看它、让它存在、把它放在眼里、舌尖上、耳边和心里。这就是美。但我们发现有些问题，因为我们追求的美好事物会让我们沉迷，但同时又不能满足我们。

为什么呢？因为他说，在人心中植入了永恒。这几乎是圣经里独一无二的一句话。他把无尽的渴望种在了人的心中。

**这意味着人们心中有一种对永恒之美的向往。**而所有这些美好的东西，如果我们一心追求它们，就像刘易斯所说的那样，最终会让我们失望，因为它们只是我们尚未闻到的花朵的香气，是未真正听到的乐曲的回响。你知道吗？如果有一种音乐是我们一出生就记得的，那会是什么？

一般来说，那就是上帝的脸庞。诗篇16章11节说：“在你的脸中充满喜乐；在你的右手中有满足的福。”诗篇27章4节也提到：“有一件事，我曾求耶和华，我仍要寻求：就是一生一世住在耶和华的殿中。” 这样翻译后，保持了原文的语气、格式，并且尽量保留了原作的修辞力量。

一个东西，那就是瘾。我所追求的，我所祈求的，就是瞻仰主的荣美，在他的殿里寻求。这其实是一个普遍的挑战。如果这是真的，很多人就麻烦了。

你们中有很多人说，我相信上帝，好的，那你为什么呢？我可以问你，你为什么相信上帝？因为我应当去教堂，或者遵守诫命。为什么？

因为这样才对。为什么？让我继续追问。最后只有两种情况：**真正的基督徒，他们的生活已经被改变，他们对待享乐的态度完全不同——既能享受它们，但又不被它们所吸引；另一种是**宗教徒，他们可能敬畏上帝，顺服上帝，但他们并不是出于对上帝本身的爱慕。

**真正的基督徒和宗教徒的区别在于，宗教徒觉得上帝对他们有用、有工具性，而基督徒则是**因为发现了上帝的美丽而顺服祂。他们不在乎其他的一切，只为那份喜悦。你看，宗教徒和基督徒虽然都敬畏上帝，但真正区别在于：宗教徒觉得上帝有用，基督徒却觉得上帝是美丽的。这对你来说是真的吗？

你有这样的体验吗？这就是**真正的基督教信仰。有人可能会问，那怎么做到呢？答案在这里： 耶稣基督，我可以告诉你什么是**福音吗？

圣经实际上是以美丽来描述福音的。因为我们的罪行，我们让世界变得丑陋了，也使自己的灵魂变得丑陋。那么，我们要如何从罪中得救？在以赛亚书第五十三章中，我们被告知：他没有美貌，我们也不羡慕他。

耶稣基督失去了他的美丽。耶稣基督变得丑陋。耶稣基督变得枯萎。耶稣基督失去了荣耀，也失去了美丽。

为什么？这是第一部分。因为我们的罪孽，他在十字架上做了什么？他在十字架上为我们受死，所以我们相信他时，圣经告诉我们什么呢？

在《歌罗西书》1章22节中说，当我们相信神和耶稣时，神会看到我们是完全的、无瑕疵的。听我说，宗教说，顺服神或者他会惩罚你。福音却说，是你让这个世界变得丑陋，你自己也变得丑陋了。耶稣基督来失去了他的美丽，好让我们相信他后，在神的眼中，不再是丑陋的，而是美丽的。

你是完全美丽的，因为他是为了你失去了美丽。如果我告诉你顺服神或者他会惩罚你，你就得把他当成工具来看待了，实际上每一种宗教基本上都在这样做。但福音说，不是这样的，看看他为你所做的一切吧。这很美。

你觉得你是罪人吗？你觉得你是失落的吗？你们当中很多人可能不会这样认为。毕竟，你们住在纽约。

**这意味着什么？直到你认识到这一点，你才会觉得他们是美丽的，而不是工具性的。**你的心中那些让你上瘾的东西才不会占据你的内心，被更高层次的美丽所取代。你的心需要一个美的对象。

你不能仅仅通过试图摆脱它们来去除那些束缚着你的心灵的东西，而必须用更高的美、更大的美来替代它们，这就是福音。如果你只是说他很大，我最好顺服他因为他会惩罚我，那我们为什么不用这种方式得到美丽呢？但只有当你认识到你是罪人，并看到他的作为时，你才能成为基督徒。通过看见主的美丽来成为基督徒。

但现在，你们当中有些人是基督徒，你们在说什么呢？你们在说：“我是基督徒，但我被某种东西所吸引。”好吧？这是因为你没有注视他的美。

## 福音之美 / The Beauty of the Gospel

That's what real Christianity is. Well, somebody says, wow, how, how could that happen? Here's the answer.

Jesus Christ, can I tell you what the gospel is? The Bible actually gives you the gospel in terms of beauty. We, because of our sin, have made the world ugly.

We've made our souls ugly. We've made the world ugly. How are we going to be saved from our sin?

We're told in Isaiah chapter 53, the servant came from heaven and he came to earth and we're told this about him. He had, this is, this is Isaiah 53, he had no beauty that we should desire him. Jesus Christ lost his beauty.

Jesus Christ became ugly. Jesus Christ became shriveled. Jesus Christ lost his glory and he lost his beauty.

Why? That's the first half. Because of our sin and what did he do when he died on the cross?

He died on the cross in our place so that when we believe in him, what are we told? In Colossians chapter 1, verse 22, there it tells us so that now when we believe in God, with Jesus, God looks at us and he sees us wholly and spotless without blemish. Listen, religion says, obey God or he'll get you.

The gospel said you've made the world ugly and yourself ugly. Jesus Christ came and lost his beauty so that now when you believe in him, you don't just now, you know, you know, that doesn't just make you a better person in some way. You're beautiful in God's sight.

You are in a sheer beauty to him because he lost his beauty so you could get it. Now, if I tell you obey God or he'll get you, you'll have to treat him as instrumental and frankly, every religion essentially tells you that. But the gospel says, no, look at what he's done for you.

That's beautiful. Do you believe you're a sinner? Do you believe you're lost?

Now a lot of you wouldn't. I mean, you live in New York. A lot of you wouldn't.

Do you know what that means? Until you see that, you'll never find them beautiful. You'll only find them instrumental and you'll never have the things in your heart that are addicting you thrown out for a greater beauty.

Your heart needs an object of beauty. You can't get rid of the ones that are holding on to you just by trying to throw them out. They have to be displaced by a higher beauty, a greater beauty, and this is it.

You'll never find him beautiful. If you just say he's very big and he's very big and I better obey him because he'll crush me. Now, why don't we get beauty that way?

But only if you see that you're a sinner and you see what he's done. That's how you become a Christian, seeing the beauty of the Lord. But now, some of you are Christians and you know what you're saying?

You're saying, I am a Christian, but I'm addicted to something. All right? That's because you're not gazing on his beauty.

You're not gazing. Well, you say, how do I gaze on this beauty? Well, it'd really be another sermon, however.

Just let me just tell you three things. First of all, you have to get to know Jesus, not God in general, Jesus. Jesus became a human being.

He became a sensory person, a human being. He entered into our sensory environment because we can have this kind of intimacy with him so he can really be a beauty to us. I have to read about him.

You have to get to know everything you can about him, everything. That's first. Then secondly, prayer is very deep.

First thing is, get to know Jesus. Secondly, don't think prayer is easy or simple. If you want to make him a professional baseball player, it's going to take a long time.

You can't just get out there. Here's a bat. Here's a ball.

I throw up in the air. I hit the ball. I'm going to go show up.

It's Shay Stadium. Hey, I understand you're in a wild car race. Do you need somebody?

It takes years and years and years. And prayer is a lot harder than that. You haven't even begun to figure out the depths of prayer.

You haven't begun to look at praise. You haven't begun to see what happens through repentance. Beauty happens.

You see the beauty of his majesty. You see the beauty of his symmetry. You see the beauty of his fragility, of his weakness.

You just see it. It comes in prayer. But thirdly, you need the Holy Spirit because you know an artwork needs a light.

Every art gallery has lights. And Jesus Christ is nothing without Holy Spirit. But Jesus says, when the Spirit comes, he will glorify me.

He will take of mine and he will glorify me. Ask the Spirit, learn to pray, look at Jesus, and know that real thing that your heart needs to overcome your addictions is not just a general knowledge of who he is in trying harder, but an experience of his beauty.

你没有在看。你说，我怎么才能看到这种美呢？这又会是另一篇讲道了。让我告诉你三点。

首先，你要认识耶稣，不是一般的神，而是耶稣。耶稣成为了一位真人。他进入我们的感官世界中，因为我们能与他有这种亲密的关系，所以他可以真正地成为一种美。我必须去了解他。

你要尽可能多地了解他的一切，一切。这是第一步。其次，祈祷是非常深刻的。首先，要认识耶稣。

第二，不要认为祈祷是容易或简单的。如果你想让他成为一名职业棒球运动员，那需要很长时间。你不能只是出去了。这里给你一个球棒，一个球。

我向上一扔，你就打个球。我要去展示一下。那是谢伊体育场。嘿，我知道你在参加一场疯狂的汽车比赛。

你需要有人帮忙吗？祈祷比这要难得多。你甚至还没有开始理解祈祷的深度。你还没有开始欣赏赞美。

你还没有看到悔改所发生的事情。美就出现了。你会看到他威严之美。你会看到他对称之美。

你会看到他的脆弱，他的软弱。这一切都在祈祷中显现出来。但第三点，你需要圣灵，因为你知道一件艺术品需要光。每个艺术画廊都有灯光。

没有圣灵，耶稣基督什么都不是。但是耶稣说，当圣灵来的时候，他会使我得荣耀。他会将我的事分给人，并且使他得荣耀。求圣灵，学习祈祷，看看耶稣，并知道你内心真正需要克服成瘾的东西不仅仅是对他的认识更加深入，而是体验到他的美。
