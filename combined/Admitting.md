## 引言：主祷文是一切问题的答案

Welcome to Gospel in Life. In a world that leaves us exhausted, distracted, and searching for meaning, Jesus gives us the Lord's Prayer as a guide to true connection with God. Join us today as Tim Keller shows us why the Lord's Prayer isn't just a ritual to recite, but a pathway to deeper communion with God. On earth as it is in heaven, give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sin. Here ends the reading of God's Word. We're in a series on the Lord's Prayer. We're continuing the series on the Lord's Prayer, and it won't be over today, either. The Lord's Prayer is Jesus' model for prayer, and it's a wonder. It's a wonder. I am a cautious person.

Those of you who know me realize that I've got a cynical streak in me that I've got to always keep under control. I don't tend to believe in large claims. I don't tend to believe testimonies. I've got a cynical streak in me.

And yet I can say to you now, without any rather, without any reservations at all, that all of the answers to all of your problems, when they're rightly understood, are here. They're all in here. The answers to all of your problems, if you rightly understand them, are in the Lord's Prayer. If you would simply do what Jesus tells you to do, here. That's it.

That's the answer. And that's from a cynic. Think of the wonder of that. And look, here, just remember, let's, because every week we're looking at a particular aspect of prayer, it's helpful occasionally, or at least in the beginning, to always give ourselves an overview and look at the theme. We said last week, and I'll repeat this, prayer is a healing process in which the heart is brought back into its true orbit. That is, to center on and worship and glorify God. If a satellite goes out of its true orbit, it might get too close to the atmosphere and begin to burn up, or it might come too close to the sun, and begin to burn up.

> "愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。我们日用的饮食，今日赐给我们。免我们的债，如同我们免了人的债。不叫我们遇见试探，救我们脱离凶恶。你们饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必饶恕你们的过犯。你们不饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必不饶恕你们的过犯。"
> ——马太福音 6:10-15

以上是神话语的宣读。我们正在进行一系列关于主祷文的讲道。我们继续这个主祷文系列，今天也不会结束。主祷文是耶稣为我们提供的祷告典范，它是一个奇妙。它是一个奇妙。我是一个谨慎的人。

认识我的人都知道，我内心有一种愤世嫉俗的倾向，需要时刻加以控制。我不太容易相信那些宏大的宣称。我不太容易相信各种见证。我内心有一种愤世嫉俗的倾向。

然而此刻我可以毫无保留地告诉你们——完全毫无保留地——你们所有问题的所有答案，如果被正确理解的话，都在这里。全部都在这里面。你们所有问题的所有答案，如果你们正确地理解，都在主祷文里。只要你们照着耶稣在这里吩咐你们做的去做就行了。就是这样。

这就是答案。而这话出自一个愤世嫉俗的人。想想这是何等奇妙。

## 祷告是让心灵回归正确轨道

And the Bible says, literally, that's the reason all of us are burning out, if we are. We're burning out if we center on anything besides Him. If we center on anything or on our ego, we burn out.

But prayer is healing the heart, bringing it back into its true orbit. Or, put another way, prayer, the Lord's Prayer is a vision of a whole new life, and it will not work for you until you see it as such. Did you hear that?

The Lord's Prayer is actually a vision for a whole new kind of life, and it will not work for you until you see it as such. What is that vision?

Well, the vision goes like this, that would have a life of such full-hearted response to the heavenly love of God, the fatherly love of God, that we would live, first of all, in complete peace, because we totally trust in Him for our daily bread, our daily needs. And secondly, we would also live with happy submission, glad anticipation. We would joyfully see God's loving purpose in everything that happens to us. I will be done, which we'll look at next week. And we would know tremendous freedom and power, because our conscience would always be totally clear. And all relationships would be perfect, because we are not only feeling forgiven by God, but we are forgiving. A life of absolute peace, a life of tremendous clarity, a life of total power and freedom, a life of high beauty.

看，在这里，记住，因为每周我们都在查看祷告的某一个方面，偶尔——或者至少在开头——给自己一个总览并审视整个主题是有帮助的。我们上周说过，这里我再重复一遍：祷告是一个医治的过程，在这个过程中，心灵被带回到它真正的轨道上。也就是说，以神为中心，敬拜祂，荣耀祂。如果一颗卫星偏离了它正确的轨道，它可能太靠近大气层而开始燃烧，或者太靠近太阳而开始燃烧。

圣经说——确确实实地说——这正是我们所有人倦怠的原因，如果你正在经历倦怠的话。如果我们以神以外的任何事物为中心，我们就会倦怠。如果我们以任何事物或以自我为中心，我们就会倦怠。

但祷告就是医治心灵，将它带回到它正确的轨道上。或者换一种说法，主祷文是一个全新生命的异象，除非你把它当作这样来看，否则它对你不起作用。你听到了吗？

主祷文实际上是一种全新生命的异象，除非你把它当作这样来看，否则它对你不起作用。那个异象是什么呢？

---

## 全新生命的异象

That's the vision of the Lord's Prayer, a life that revolves around God. So the Lord's Prayer is not just a little how-to. It is a how-to manual on prayer, but it's a vision of a whole new life.

So we come back to the central thing. Since prayer essentially is centering on God, it's essentially adoration. And we said everything starts with adoration, and everything has to be understood as flowing. When you ask for things, when you confess your sins, when you do anything else in prayer, it has to flow out of adoration. We said that it's so important to see that.

I know personally that I have to constantly pull myself up. I've got to do this all the time. I run into God, and I sit down, and I start to say, God, you've got to help me. And I run right away to requests and asking instead of doing what Jesus says in the prayer, which is to sit down and to collect yourself. Collect yourself.

And then say, Oh Lord, I remember and I rejoice in Your fatherly love and Your heavenly power. And I realize now, and I rejoice in the fact that You are more want to give me things than I am to ask for them. You are, as the Anglican Prayer Book says, He is want to give us more than we desire or deserve, and He has the power to do that. And as you adore, then you turn and you actually feel the fear and the anxiety and the resentment draining out your back. Like somebody came in and lanced a boil or lanced a sore. You feel the pus just coming out as you say, Lord, forgive me for forgetting your wisdom. Forgive me for forgetting your power.

---

这个异象是这样的：你会有一种全心全意回应神天上之爱、天父之爱的生命。因此你会活在，首先，完全的平安之中，因为你全然信靠祂赐你日用的饮食、日常的需要。其次，你也会活在喜乐的顺服和欢欣的盼望之中。你会喜乐地看到神充满慈爱的旨意在你身上所发生的一切事中——"愿你的旨意成就"——这是我们下周要查看的内容。你还会经历极大的自由和能力，因为你的良心会始终完全清洁。而且一切人际关系都会是完美的，因为你不仅感受到被神饶恕，同时你也在饶恕别人。一个绝对平安的生命，一个极度清明的生命，一个完全有能力和自由的生命，一个充满美好的生命。

这就是主祷文的异象——一个以神为中心的生命。所以主祷文不只是一个小小的操作指南。它确实是一本关于祷告的操作手册，但它更是一个全新生命的异象。

## 一切始于敬拜赞美

And then you begin to just let your needs be known with quiet power. The Lord's Prayer is a process that if you obey it, if you discipline yourself according to it, you pass into a whole new way of life. Now, I think I mentioned last week that basically you can think of prayer in terms of three A's. That is, adoration or praise, admitting or confession of sin, repentance, and asking, which is petition or request. And even though the outline in the bulletin looks like I was going to hit on admitting and asking, I can't get to asking today. We're going to have to get to it next week. And today we're going to talk about admitting.

But let me reiterate in the beginning, and I'll come back to end. If your repentance, if your admitting doesn't flow out of adoration, if your asking doesn't flow out of adoration, you're stuck. In fact, you're worse than stuck. If your repentance doesn't flow out of adoration of the Father, it will not only not deal with your guilt, it will make it worse. Do you hear me?

If your repentance doesn't flow out of adoration of the Father, it will not just not deal with your guilt, it will make it worse. Your requests do not flow out of adoration of the Father. They will not only not deal with your anxiety, they'll make it worse. Because when you pray to God for your needs, that's supposed to get rid of anxiety. And when you confess your sins to God, it's supposed to get rid of your guilt.

But I know from experience, and so do you, that praying over your sins can make you feel more guilty and praying about your needs can make you feel more anxious. Why?

Because we don't fit into the Lord's Prayer, which is the perfect and ultimate and infallible model for this new kind of life and for prayer itself. And today we'll only talk about admitting, confession, repentance, and how Jesus Christ, in the context of the Lord's Prayer, tells us we should do it. And I just want to show you that Jesus teaches an awful lot in the Lord's Prayer about repenting and about confessing your sins before God.

The first thing... Listen, let's deal with it under these headings. Number one, why do it?

Second, the reason for repentance. I know they're not the headings in the bulletin. I changed my mind. I'm sorry. Okay?

Repentance. Why?

---

所以我们回到核心。既然祷告本质上是以神为中心，它本质上就是敬拜赞美。我们说过一切都始于敬拜赞美，一切都必须被理解为从敬拜赞美中流淌出来。当你祈求时，当你认罪时，当你在祷告中做任何其他事情时，都必须从敬拜赞美中流淌出来。我们说过看到这一点是多么重要。

我个人知道我必须不断提醒自己。我必须时刻这样做。我跑到神面前，坐下来，就开始说："神啊，你必须帮助我。"我立刻就跑到请求和恳求那里去了，而不是按照耶稣在祷告中所教导的去做——就是坐下来，先收摄自己。收摄你自己。

然后说："主啊，我记得并且欢喜你天父般的爱和你天上的大能。我此刻认识到，并且欢喜这样一个事实——你赐给我的意愿比我去祈求的意愿更强烈。"正如英国国教公祷书所说，祂愿意赐给我们的超过我们所渴求所配得的，并且祂有能力成就这一切。当你如此敬拜赞美的时候，你转过身来，你真的感受到恐惧、焦虑和怨恨从你背后流淌出去。就好像有人来切开了一个脓疮。你感受到脓液正在流出，同时你说："主啊，请饶恕我忘记了你的智慧。请饶恕我忘记了你的大能。"

然后你开始以安静的力量将你的需要陈明。主祷文是一个过程，如果你遵行它，如果你按照它来操练自己，你就进入了一种全新的生活方式。我想我上周提到过，基本上你可以将祷告概括为三个"A"。也就是：敬拜赞美（adoration or praise）、认罪（admitting or confession of sin, repentance）、和祈求（asking, petition or request）。虽然周报上的大纲看起来像是我今天要讲认罪和祈求两个部分，但我今天讲不到祈求了。我们得留到下周。今天我们只讲认罪。

---

## 悔改必须从敬拜赞美中流出

What's the reason for it? Surely some people out there, thoughtful, reflective, and sensitive people would say, isn't telling people to confess their sins and repent of their sins every time they pray, isn't that dangerous?

Isn't that emotionally and psychologically dangerous? Aren't people already weighed down with their own guilt?

Aren't people already full of self-loathing and self-hatred? Isn't this just going to make it worse?

To tell people they have to go to God and confess their sins all the time? Well, let me ask you. Let me ask you. You're thinking, people. You are.

Let me ask you. How else do you deal with guilt?

---

但让我在开头重申，最后也会回到这一点。如果你的悔改、你的认罪不是从敬拜赞美中流出的，如果你的祈求不是从敬拜赞美中流出的，你就会停滞不前。事实上，比停滞不前更糟。如果你的悔改不是从对天父的敬拜赞美中流出的，它不仅不能解决你的罪疚感，反而会使它更加严重。你听到了吗？

如果你的悔改不是从对天父的敬拜赞美中流出的，它不仅不能解决你的罪疚感，反而会使它更加严重。如果你的祈求不是从对天父的敬拜赞美中流出的，它们不仅不能解决你的焦虑，反而会使它更加严重。因为当你向神祈求你的需要时，那本该是消除焦虑的。当你向神认罪时，那本该是消除罪疚感的。

但我从经验中知道——你们也知道——为你的罪祷告可能让你觉得更加内疚，为你的需要祷告可能让你觉得更加焦虑。为什么？

因为我们没有按照主祷文的方式去做——主祷文是那完美的、终极的、无谬误的典范，关于这种全新的生命和祷告本身。今天我们只谈认罪、悔改，以及耶稣基督在主祷文的背景下告诉我们应当如何去做。我只想让你们看到，耶稣在主祷文中关于悔改和向神认罪，教导了何等丰富的内容。

## 为什么必须悔改？

Guilt is unavoidable. And I would like to propose to you that there is no way to deal with guilt except to go to God and be religious. There is no other way other than religion to deal with guilt. No way.

There is no other way to deal inside religion with guilt except repentance. No way. A pastor friend of mine once was absolutely astonished when a psychiatrist approached him and asked him to go into practice together in the counseling. And my pastor friend said, why?

I have no training in counseling at all. Not at all. This is a psychiatrist. He was not a Christian. And he said he wasn't a Christian. Not only that, he wasn't religious.

And that really amazed the pastor. He said, well, why?

Why would you want me? And here's what he said, quote, I'm finding that many, if not most of my patients need a priest more than they need a doctor. Because what they're dealing with is guilt. And they're all tied up over moral issues and God.

Now, here's why he had to say that. He was smart and right. The key to dealing with guilt is to determine the difference between true guilt and false guilt. Right?

That would have to be it. Because, you see, if guilt is false guilt, then you argue with the person. You say, cut it out.

---

第一件事……我们按这几个要点来讲。第一，为什么要悔改？

第二，悔改的动力。我知道这和周报上的标题不一样。我改主意了。对不起。好吗？

悔改。为什么？

悔改的理由是什么？想必在座有些人——那些善于思考、善于反省、心思敏锐的人——会说，要求人们每次祷告都认罪悔改，这难道不危险吗？

从情感上和心理上来说，这难道不危险吗？人们不是已经被自己的罪疚感压得喘不过气来了吗？

人们不是已经充满了自我厌恶和自我憎恨吗？这难道不会让情况更糟吗？

告诉人们他们必须时时到神面前认罪？好吧，让我问你们。让我问你们。你们在思考，各位。确实如此。

让我问你们。你们还有什么别的方式来处理罪疚感？

罪疚感是不可避免的。我想向你们提出：除了面对神、信靠宗教，没有任何其他方式可以处理罪疚感。在宗教之外，没有任何其他途径可以处理罪疚感。没有。

在宗教之内，除了悔改，也没有任何其他方式可以处理罪疚感。没有。我一位牧师朋友曾经非常惊讶，因为有一位精神科医生找到他，请求和他合开一个联合辅导诊所。我的牧师朋友说："为什么？"

"我完全没有受过辅导方面的训练。完全没有。"这可是一位精神科医生。他不是基督徒。他说他不是基督徒。不仅如此，他甚至不信任何宗教。

这让那位牧师非常惊讶。他说："那你为什么想要我呢？"

这位精神科医生是这样回答的，我引用他的原话："我发现我的很多病人——如果不是大多数的话——更需要的是一位神父，而不是一位医生。因为他们在应对的是罪疚感。他们全都被道德问题和神的问题困住了。"

---

## 罪疚感只能在神面前解决

There's nothing wrong with what's going on here. You argue with the person and you argue lovingly with the person. And you show them that they're feeling guilty in inappropriate ways and they shouldn't do that.

And so you argue. But if it's true guilt, you say, well, you're going to have to fess up to that. You're going to have to own up to that. Own that. And you're going to have to deal with that. And you're going to have to confess that and be cleansed.

So the. The whole key is, is guilt true or false?

Now, here's the question. That nobody, by the way, nobody believes that all guilt is false. Nobody with a brain in their head would dare say all guilt is false guilt. All guilt feelings are false guilt. Because nobody wants to say that nobody could do anything wrong. That there's no such thing as a wrong action.

So granting that, how do you decide? How do you scientifically determine the validity of guilt?

Or the invalidity? If that's the key to dealing with guilt, the only, if the key is to determine whether it's valid or not, how do you do that scientifically?

The answer is, it's impossible. No scientist in the world will tell you that there's any way to determine whether guilt is true or not. That's not what science does. You're into the area of morality. You're into the area of religion. You're into the area of God. Whoops.

How do we get there? When this particular counselor admits that guilt is one of the main problems we've got, when a leading, a head of a leading British mental institution was quoted as saying, if I could assure all of my patients of complete forgiveness, I could send 50% of them home. And yet they also realize that the key to dealing with guilt is to determine whether it's true or false, whether it's real or imagined, and there's no scientific way to do that.

What are we doing here? The answer is, there's no way to deal with this unavoidable problem in our lives unless we go face to face with God. Because you see, ultimately, a psychology will tell you this. Those things which you deny control you. Those things that you deny and keep down and hide control you. And this is all confession and repentance is. It's admitting.

It's making real. It's to end the denial. It's to admit those things which, if you do not admit, are going to control you forever.

And then go to the only possible person that could deal with 's God. The only possible person. You can't deal with it yourself. A good counselor can make it, a good counselor can bring it up and make it, make it helpful for you to see.

But then in the end, they can't actually determine its validity unless you immediately jump out of the area of scientific psychology into the area of religion. You know, I think I may have mentioned this before. Becky Pippert, in her book, tells about how she was auditing a class at Harvard University in the School of Counseling. And a professor was saying, now here's how you help a man. He was giving a case study.

Here's how you help a man surface the fact that he's angry at all, as all get out about his mother. That he hates his mother. He's hostile to his mother. He's angry at her. And he feels guilty for the way he's treated her. And he shows how you can surface that.

And then somebody, I think Becky Pippert herself, the Christian writer, raised her hand and says, okay, what if he comes back and says, oh, doctor, this was very helpful to see that. And that's very enlightening and very important. And yet, I still... It doesn't seem to be helpful. I need more help. Because now that I see how angry I am at her, how do I forgive her?

And now that I see how guilty I am for what I've done, and she won't forgive me, how do I overcome the guilt? In other words, how do I forgive, and how do I be forgiving?

And the professor said, there's no way I'd know what to say. In fact, the professor literally said to Becky, I said, I would say to that man, lots of luck. And then what happened, well, the students started saying, but I thought the whole purpose of counseling was to... was to give people a cure. And the professor turned around and said, listen, there's only so far you can go, and what we've done is very helpful, but in the end, if you're looking for a changed heart, he said, and I'm quoting, you're looking in the wrong department. That's true. That's fair.

So the question is, why repent? Is it unhealthy?

现在，他为什么不得不这样说呢。他既聪明又正确。处理罪疚感的关键在于分辨真正的罪疚感和虚假的罪疚感之间的区别。对吗？

那一定是关键所在。因为，你看，如果罪疚感是虚假的，那你就和那个人辩论。你说："别这样了。"

"这里发生的事情没有什么错。"你和那个人辩论，你带着爱心和那个人辩论。你让他们看到他们在不恰当的地方感到内疚，他们不应该那样。

于是你去辩论。但如果是真正的罪疚感，你就说："嗯，你必须正视这件事。你必须承认这件事。承认它。你必须面对它。你必须认罪并得到洁净。"

所以，关键问题是：罪疚感是真的还是假的？

现在问题来了。顺便说一句，没有人相信所有的罪疚感都是假的。任何有头脑的人都不敢说所有的罪疚感都是假的。所有的内疚感都是假的。因为没有人愿意说没有人会做错事。没有所谓的错误行为。

既然承认了这一点，你怎么来判断呢？你怎么科学地确定罪疚感的有效性？

或无效性？如果这是处理罪疚感的关键——关键在于确定它是否有效——你怎么科学地做到这一点呢？

答案是：不可能。世界上没有任何科学家会告诉你有什么方法可以判定罪疚感是真是假。那不是科学所做的事。你进入了道德的领域。你进入了宗教的领域。你进入了神的领域。哎呀。

我们怎么会到这里来的？当这位特定的辅导师承认罪疚感是我们面临的主要问题之一时，当一位英国著名精神病院的负责人曾被引述说："如果我能向我所有的病人保证他们被完全赦免，我可以让其中百分之五十的人回家。"然而他们也意识到，处理罪疚感的关键在于判定它是真的还是假的、是真实的还是想象的，而没有任何科学方法可以做到这一点。

那我们在这里干什么呢？答案是：除了面对面地到神面前去，没有任何方式可以处理这个我们生命中不可避免的问题。因为你看，归根结底，心理学也会告诉你这一点。那些你否认的东西控制着你。那些你否认、压制、隐藏的东西控制着你。而认罪和悔改所做的全部事情就是——承认。

就是使之真实。就是终结否认。就是承认那些如果你不承认、就会永远控制你的东西。

然后去到唯一有可能处理这些问题的那一位面前——那就是神。唯一有可能的那一位。你自己处理不了。一位好的辅导师可以帮助你把问题表面化，让你更清楚地看到它。

但最终，他们无法真正确定其有效性，除非你立刻从科学心理学的领域跳到宗教的领域。你知道，我想我以前可能提到过这个。贝琪·皮帕特（Becky Pippert）在她的书中讲到她在哈佛大学辅导学院旁听一门课。一位教授说："现在，教你们怎样帮助一个人。"他在做一个案例研究。

"你怎样帮助一个人发现他对自己母亲极其愤怒这个事实。他恨他的母亲。他对他的母亲怀有敌意。他对她非常生气。他为自己对待她的方式感到内疚。"教授演示了你怎样可以把这些东西引导出来。

然后有人——我想是贝琪·皮帕特自己，那位基督徒作家——举手说："好的，那如果他回来说：'哦，医生，看到这些非常有帮助。这非常有启发，非常重要。但是，它好像还是不够有帮助。我需要更多的帮助。因为现在我看到了我对她有多么愤怒，但我怎样才能饶恕她呢？'"

"而且既然我看到了我有多么内疚——因为我对她做了那些事——而她又不会饶恕我，我怎样才能克服这种罪疚感呢？换句话说，我怎样去饶恕，又怎样被饶恕呢？"

那位教授说："我完全不知道该说什么。"事实上，那位教授对贝琪说了这样的原话："我会对那个人说，祝你好运。"然后发生了什么呢，学生们开始说："可我以为辅导的全部目的就是……给人一个治愈啊。"教授转过身来说："听着，你能走的路只有这么远。我们所做的已经非常有帮助了，但最终，如果你寻找的是一颗改变了的心——"他说——我在引用他的话——"你找错了科室。"这是真实的。这是公正的。

## 卓别林与球和链：我们无法自我拯救

Absolutely not. You know, Charles Chaplin, in the one... one of his great silent films, there's this great place where he's a... he's a prisoner, so he's got a ball and a chain on his foot, his leg, and he is shipwrecked on an island, and he says, here's my chance to escape. What he's going to do, what he has to do, but he has to deal with a ball and a chain.

So the first thing you see him doing is you see him telling jokes to it. Tells a lot of jokes and tries to get it laughing, and then he tries to run away and immediately, wham, falls down, because, you know, the ball won't let him go. So he comes on back, he says, this time he'll fool it, so you see him, you know, you can just imagine Charles sort of whistling and acting like, maybe it may be... if he's not watching, maybe I can fool him.

And then suddenly he runs, and of course, wham, falls down immediately, because the ball won't budge. Then finally we see him burying the ball. He just takes the sand, and he just starts to bury it. And he puts it down so he can't see it. Says, that will do it.

And then he tries to run away, and wham, he falls down again, and it's only after this very funny and excellent little scene, at the end of it, he suddenly starts to realize, I can't escape. I have to be rescued. I can't escape. And he starts to look for a shift. And listen, that's... I see my... Do you see yourself in that?

You see, you can spend a lot of time blaming other people for your problems and your sin. And you might go through another phase in which you justify and rationalize it. And you might go through another phase in which you analyze it, another phase in which you deny it.

But in the end, unless you go to the only one who can deal with it, analysis won't work, even though it's helpful, it only goes so far. Ignoring it certainly won't work, and denying it, until you go to the only one that can deal with it, you're still chained to it. The only escape is rescue. In Greek, it means salvation, deliverance. Why repent?

Because there's absolutely no other way, emotionally or spiritually, to get freedom. And I proved it, I hope, as much as I possibly could. There it is.

Now, number one. Number two. Jesus Christ teaches us here also the motivation for repentance.

那么问题是：为什么要悔改？悔改有害健康吗？

绝对不是。你知道查理·卓别林在他的一部伟大的默片中有一个精彩的场景。他是一个囚犯，脚上套着铁球和锁链。他遭遇了海难流落到一个岛上。他说："这是我逃跑的机会。"他要做的事——他必须做的事——是先处理那个铁球和锁链。

你看到他做的第一件事是对着铁球讲笑话。讲了很多笑话，试图让它笑起来，然后他试着跑掉，结果砰的一下摔倒了，因为铁球不让他走。于是他走回来，说这次他要骗过它。你可以想象查理那副模样，吹着口哨，装出若无其事的样子，也许……如果他没在注意的话，也许我能骗过它。

然后他突然拔腿就跑，结果当然又砰的一下立刻摔倒了，因为铁球纹丝不动。最后我们看到他在埋那个铁球。他只是抓起沙子，开始把它埋起来。他把它埋到看不见为止。说："这下可以了。"

然后他又试着跑掉，砰，他又摔倒了。在这个非常有趣又精彩的片段结束时，他终于开始意识到：我逃不掉。我必须被救。我逃不掉。于是他开始寻找一艘船。听着，这就是……你看到你自己在里面了吗？

你看，你可以花大量的时间把你的问题和罪归咎于他人。你可能经历另一个阶段，在其中为之辩解和合理化。你可能经历又一个阶段，在其中分析它，再一个阶段，在其中否认它。

但到最后，除非你去到那唯一能处理这件事的那一位面前——分析不管用，虽然它有帮助，但只能走到一定程度。忽视它当然不管用，否认它也不行——除非你去到唯一能处理这件事的那一位面前，你仍然被它捆锁着。唯一的出路是被拯救。在希腊语里，这个词的意思是"得救"、"得释放"。为什么要悔改？

因为在情感上或属灵上，绝对没有其他任何方式可以获得自由。我已经尽我所能地证明了这一点。就是这样。

## 悔改的动力：爱而非惧怕

Now, the word motivation has in it a little word from which we get the word motor. And I would suggest to have to ask ourselves, what drives your repentance?

What is the motor? What is the dynamic?

What is the thing that drives your repentance? The reason we ask that is because Paul, in 2 Corinthians 7, says this. Godly repentance leads to deliverance and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. This is a frightening verse. Do you know why?

Paul tells us there's two ways to be repenting of your sin. And there's a certain way that brings freedom, and brings healing, and brings sweetness, and brings zeal and increased strength. And there's another way to be sorrowful about your wrongdoing that has to do with your sin. And there's another way to be sorrowful about your wrongdoing that actually leads to psychological and maybe even physical death. And they look alike.

Now, here's the question. How do you know whether when you repent, or when you are repenting, how do you know whether it's healthy, spiritually liberating, or whether it's just a function of, an expression of, an unhealthy self-hatred, an overactive conscience that's full of unrealistic and unfair and unnecessary standards that have been put in there by your parents, or by your peer group, or by your culture?

How do you know, in other words, whether your repentance is liberating you or killing you? And the answer, Jesus Christ tells us, is it flows out of adoration. Real repentance comes after Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. You do not get the confession until you are firmly, until you are grasping, until you're looking at the dying love of Jesus Christ, who enables us to not see God as just a king, but as a father.

Let me put it this way. A man some years ago named Stephen Sharnock, a great minister, wrote this 350 years ago. So I'm going to paraphrase it and get a lot of the archaic language out of it. He tries to explain the difference between what he would call legalistic repentance or conviction of sin and godly. And listen to this. A legalistic conviction of sin arises from a consideration of God's love for us. It's a consideration of God's justice.

好，第一点讲完了。第二点。耶稣基督在这里还教导我们悔改的动力。

"动力"（motivation）这个词里面包含一个小词，我们由此得到"马达"（motor）这个词。我建议我们需要问问自己：什么在驱动你的悔改？

什么是那个发动机？什么是那个推动力？

什么是驱动你悔改的东西？我们之所以要问这个问题，是因为保罗在哥林多后书第七章这样说：

> "因为依着神的意思忧愁，就生出没有后悔的懊悔来，以致得救；但世俗的忧愁是叫人死。"
> ——哥林多后书 7:10

这是一节令人震惊的经文。你知道为什么吗？

保罗告诉我们有两种为罪悔改的方式。有一种方式带来自由、带来医治、带来甘甜、带来热忱和增添的力量。还有另一种方式为自己的过犯忧伤——与你的罪有关的。还有另一种方式为自己的过犯忧伤，实际上却导致心理上甚至肉体上的死亡。而这两种看起来很相似。

现在问题来了。当你悔改的时候，或者当你正在悔改的时候，你怎么知道它是健康的、属灵上释放的，还是只是不健康的自我憎恨的一种功能、一种表达——一个过度活跃的良心，充满了不切实际、不公正、不必要的标准，这些标准是你的父母、你的同龄人或你的文化灌输给你的？

换句话说，你怎么知道你的悔改是在释放你还是在杀死你？耶稣基督告诉我们的答案是：真正的悔改是从敬拜赞美中流出的。真正的悔改是在"我们在天上的父，愿人都尊你的名为圣。愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上"之后才出现的。在你牢牢地抓住、注视着耶稣基督为我们舍命的爱之前——正是这份爱使我们不仅仅看到神是一位君王，更看到祂是一位父亲——你不会来到真正的认罪面前。

## 律法主义的悔改与福音的悔改

But godly repentance flows chiefly from a sense of God's love. A legalistic repentant cries out, I have provoked the sovereign God who can tear up the rocks and the trees. But the godly repentant cries, I have spurned a loving goodness which is as sweet and as tender as the dropping of the dew. I have turned on a God who is a tender father. You see?

Oh, this is my heart made of coal iron or marble to treat Him like this? Godly repentance. He finds his misery coming from the mercy of God. What a fool, says the godly repentant to his heart, to rush into a river of brimstone through a sea of goodness, to turn from such a sweet fountain to rake in the mud puddles. Did you hear that?

He says, godly repentance is moved by a sight of a tender, loving, heavenly father. In other words, real repentance has to come from a rejoicing in the goodness, the acceptance, and the love of God. When you look at what He's done for you, and when you look at His love, that makes you feel bad about your sin, yeah, but in a cleansing way, because it's the very certainty of His love that drives your repentance. It's the very fact of His acceptance and of His love that makes you say, how can I do this to someone like that?

And so instead of it making you feel worse about yourself, it makes you hate the habit. It makes you hate the wrongdoing. It makes you want to get rid of it for His sake.

There is a big difference, and that's the reason why Sharnock can say, you see, a legalistic conviction of sin arises chiefly from a sense of God's love, from a sense of God's justice. I have provoked the sovereign God who can tear up the rocks and the trees, but a godly repentance says, I have spurned the love of the Father. You see, when you look, I can put it like this.

I can put it like this. I'll tell you how I deal with my own heart, how I have to do. You look at Jesus dying, and you see on the one hand, that's serious. That shows that what I have done wrong is serious, or God would not have gone to that length. The things that I'm doing that are wrong are really wrong.

But at the very same moment, I say, the very act of dying on the cross, at the same moment that it shows me how serious my sin is, also, also guarantees and shows me without a doubt that he accepts and loves me. And you know, that's a hard thing for the human ego to accept. The human ego wants to say, look, if I've done well, then I don't mind you accepting me.

But if I've done poorly, I want you to just walk all over me. That's the way your ego works. Because you were born under a covenant of works, the Bible says. You were born in a situation where you know intrinsically we ought to do right. The gospel comes and says, yes, what you've done is wrong, and I love, and I accept you. And the ego doesn't like that, and it has to be shown that. I have to look at the cross, and I see here's Jesus dying.

让我这样说。多年前有一个人叫司提反·查诺克（Stephen Charnock），一位伟大的牧师，在三百五十年前写了这些话。所以我会把它转述一下，去掉其中大量古旧的语言。他试图解释律法主义的认罪——或者说律法主义的罪疚感——与敬虔的悔改之间的区别。请听好。律法主义的认罪来自于对神公义的思考。

而敬虔的悔改主要来自于对神之爱的感受。一个律法主义的悔改者会喊道："我得罪了那位全能的神，祂可以撕裂岩石和树木！"但敬虔的悔改者会喊道："我辜负了一份如甘露般柔和温柔的慈爱善意。我背叛了一位温柔的父亲。"你看到了吗？

"哦，我这颗心是煤铁做的还是大理石做的，竟然这样对待祂？"敬虔的悔改。他发现自己的痛苦来自于神的怜悯。敬虔的悔改者对自己的心说："多么愚蠢啊，穿过一片善良的海洋却投身于硫磺的河流，离开如此甘甜的泉源却去泥潭里翻找。"你听到了吗？

他说，敬虔的悔改是被那位温柔的、慈爱的、天上的父亲的异象所感动的。换句话说，真正的悔改必须来自于对神的善良、接纳和爱的欢喜。当你注视祂为你所做的一切，当你注视祂的爱，那确实会让你为自己的罪感到难过——是的——但却是以一种洁净的方式。因为正是祂的爱的确定性在驱动你的悔改。正是祂接纳你、爱你这个事实使你说："我怎么能对这样一位做出这种事呢？"

因此，它不会让你对自己感觉更糟，而是让你恨恶那个习惯。让你恨恶那个过犯。让你想要为了祂的缘故除掉它。

这就是为什么查诺克可以说——你看——律法主义的认罪主要来自于对神公义的感受："我得罪了那位全能的神，祂可以撕裂岩石和树木。"但敬虔的悔改说："我辜负了天父的爱。"你看，当你这样注视的时候，我可以这样来说。

## 十字架：同时显明罪的严重与神的接纳

Why did Jesus die so poorly? I often think about that. He did die poorly.

There's a lot of people that went to the stake. They went to the firing squad. There are people who went singing hymns. They went rejoicing. Do you see Jesus doing that?

Do you see Jesus say, oh, I'm just praising the Lord on the way to the cross? Do you see him rejoicing?

Absolutely not. You see him in a bloody sweat. You see blood coming out of his pores.

---

我可以这样来说。我来告诉你们我如何面对自己内心的挣扎，我不得不怎样做。你注视耶稣为你而死。你一方面看到：这是严肃的。这说明我所做的错事是严重的，否则神不会走到那个地步。我所做的那些错误的事真的错了。

但在同一时刻，我说：十字架上舍命这个行为本身，在向我显明我的罪有多么严重的同一时刻，也保证了、毫无疑问地向我显明了：祂接纳我、爱我。你知道，这对人的自我来说是很难接受的。人的自我想说："如果我做得好，那你接纳我我不介意。"

"但如果我做得糟糕，我希望你狠狠地踩我。"你的自我就是这样运作的。因为圣经说，你生来就在行为之约的辖制之下。你生在一种处境中，你内在地知道我们应当行善。福音来了，说："是的，你所做的是错的——而我爱你、我接纳你。"自我不喜欢这样，它必须被指给它看。我必须注视十字架——我在这里看到耶稣正在受死。

## 耶稣为何"死得如此艰难"？

You see him wrestling on the ground. You see him say, Lord, if there's any way you can get me out of this, please do it. Because he had a death that no one else ever faced. All of God's eternal punishment, not just for me, but for all of us, and for all of us, rested on him at once. For thousands and millions of people and billions of people rested on him at once. And not just spread out over all of eternity, but all compressed and put on his back at one moment. And whatever it was, was so incredibly painful and so staggering that the mind of the second person of the Trinity almost cracked under it.

And why did he do that? He did it to make me holy. Because he knew the only way I'd ever be happy is if I was holy, because I was built to obey God. And he is that committed to making me holy. And this is how I repay him?

The fact that I haven't prayed this week? This is how I repay him?

The fact that I haven't been telling the truth this week? This is how I repay him?

The fact that I'm not... I'm not being patient this week?

Is this how I repay him? Does that make me want to move away from him?

---

为什么耶稣死得如此艰难？我经常思想这个问题。祂确实死得很艰难。

有很多人走上了火刑柱。他们走向了行刑队。有人唱着赞美诗前行。他们满心欢喜地前行。你看到耶稣这样做了吗？

你看到耶稣说："哦，我在去十字架的路上赞美主"了吗？你看到祂欢喜了吗？

绝对没有。你看到的是祂的汗如大血点滴下。你看到血从祂的毛孔中渗出。

你看到祂在地上挣扎。你听到祂说："主啊，如果有任何方式可以让我免受这事，求你成就。"因为祂面对了一种没有任何人曾面对过的死亡。神永恒的全部刑罚——不仅是为我一个人，而是为我们所有人、为千百万人、数十亿人——一齐压在祂身上。不是分散在永恒之中，而是全部压缩在一起，在一瞬间加在祂的背上。无论那是什么，它是如此令人难以置信地痛苦、如此令人震惊，以至于三位一体第二位格的心智几乎在其下崩溃。

祂为什么这样做？祂这样做是为了使我成圣。因为祂知道我快乐的唯一途径就是成为圣洁，因为我被造就是为了顺服神。祂就是如此委身于使我成圣。而这就是我回报祂的方式吗？

这一周我没有祷告？这就是我回报祂的方式吗？

这一周我没有说实话？这就是我回报祂的方式吗？

这一周我没有忍耐？

这就是我回报祂的方式吗？这会让我想要远离祂吗？

会让我想要自我惩罚吗？不。它让我想要直接跑到祂面前说："主啊，我怎么会如此愚蠢，竟辜负了你的爱？"

## 唯有在基督里才能真正悔改

Does it make me want to kick myself? It makes me want to go right to him and say, Lord, how could I have been so foolish as to spurn your love?

And don't you see, therefore, why the only people who can actually repent and get cleansing and deal with their guilt are people who have received Jesus Christ as Savior. Because if you come to God not sure you belong to him, not sure you've lived up to standards, if you come to him like that and you start to confess your sins, it will really destroy you. Because your whole way of thinking about yourself, your whole self-image is based on you not being too bad a person.

That's how you're even able to function emotionally in the world, is because you say, well, I've got this or that bad, but basically I'm better than an awful lot of other people. And when you start to look at your sins, to even admit them, you begin to feel your life ebbing away and it destroys you. R.C. Sproul, a pastor and also a writer, tells a story about a woman who came to him and said, Dr. Sproul, I have a real problem. I keep asking God forgiveness and asking God for forgiveness and asking God for forgiveness. And I just don't feel forgiven.

And he looked at her and he said, well, your problem probably is you're not actually asking God for forgiveness for the right sin, the main sin. She said, what is that?

He said, you haven't asked forgiveness for your sins. You're asking God for your pride. Now, I don't know how tender he was when he said that to her, but I'm going to try to be tender to you. He was right, probably.

I don't know the woman. I just read about this. But probably she was reacting to grace because most of us like our forgiveness the old-fashioned Smith-Barney way. We want to earn it. And when we say I can't forgive myself, what we mean is I haven't lived up to standards and I'm going to sit here and kick myself and punish myself and I don't want anybody to take that off of me.

I don't like the fact. That I need bleeding charity. And as a result, you say, I can't forgive myself. It looks like spiritual humility. It's absolutely arrogance. R.C. is right.

And the only way, therefore, that you're able actually to ever have your repentance bring cleansing is if you have accepted Christ as Savior and you've given up the whole idea of trying on your own to be good enough to live up to standards. Have God accept you, to have the world accept you, to have you accept yourself. And you've never actually said nothing in my hands I bring simply because I cross, I cling. I completely rely on your grace. I completely rely, oh Lord Jesus Christ, on what you did for me on the cross. Until you do that, repentance will kill you. And you've got no alternative but to hide your sins from yourself.

Or when you repent, you'll just feel worse and worse and worse, not better. You see that?

If your boss comes to you and says, you broke a rule. And as a result, I'm canceling your raise. I'm busting you down to a lower rank and you may not have your contract renewed. You better do well.

所以你们难道看不出来，为什么唯有接受了耶稣基督作为救主的人，才能真正地悔改、得洁净、处理他们的罪疚感吗？因为如果你来到神面前，不确定自己属于祂，不确定自己是否达到了标准——如果你这样来到祂面前开始认罪，那真的会摧毁你。因为你整个关于自己的思维方式、你整个自我形象，都建立在"你不算太坏"这个基础上。

你之所以能在情感上正常地生活在这个世界上，就是因为你说："嗯，我这方面那方面有问题，但基本上我比很多人都好。"而当你开始审视自己的罪、甚至只是承认它们的时候，你开始感到生命在流逝，它会摧毁你。史普罗（R.C. Sproul），一位牧师兼作家，讲了一个故事。一位女士来找他说："史普罗博士，我有一个真正的问题。我不断地求神饶恕、不断地求神饶恕、不断地求神饶恕。可我就是感觉不到被饶恕。"

他看着她说："嗯，你的问题可能是你实际上没有为正确的罪——那个主要的罪——求神饶恕。"她说："那是什么？"

他说："你还没有为你的罪求饶恕。你在为你的骄傲求神赦免。"我不知道他说这话时有多温柔，但我会试着温柔地对你们说。他可能是对的。

我不认识那位女士。我只是读到过这个故事。但她很可能是在抗拒恩典。因为我们大多数人喜欢用老式的、"史密斯巴尼式"的方式来获得饶恕。我们想要赚取它。当我们说"我无法饶恕自己"的时候，我们的意思是："我没有达到标准，我要坐在这里自我鞭打、自我惩罚——我不希望任何人把这从我身上拿走。"

"我不喜欢这个事实——我需要白白的恩惠。"结果你说"我无法饶恕自己"。这看起来像是属灵的谦卑。它完完全全是骄傲。史普罗是对的。

因此，你能够让悔改真正带来洁净的唯一方式，就是接受基督为你的救主，放弃靠自己努力达到标准的全部想法——让神接纳你、让世界接纳你、让你接纳自己。你要真正地说出来："两手空空无可夸，唯靠十架来投靠。"我完全依赖你的恩典。我完全依靠——主耶稣基督——你在十字架上为我所做的一切。除非你这样做，悔改只会杀死你。你别无选择，只能向自己隐藏你的罪。

或者当你悔改的时候，你只会感觉越来越糟、越来越糟、越来越糟，而不是越来越好。你明白了吗？

## 老板与父亲：两种截然不同的悔改

And so you start to say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But your sorrow is driven by fear of consequences. It's driven by anger and self-hatred.

Why did you do that? You fool, you say to yourself. You might even be angry at your boss for not being more forgiving or being unfair in some way.

But if a father comes to you and says, son, daughter, you've disobeyed me. That doesn't change my love for you one whit. You know what I've done for past and I will continue to do for future.

I want you to repent because I want you to come and embrace me. I want to get rid of the distance between us. When will that happen?

And you say, I'm sorry, father. And what's happening is your sorrow is driven by something completely different. It's driven by love. It's driven by grateful joy. It's driven by grace. The motor for real repentance. The kind of repentance that liberates instead of killing is what?

---

如果你的老板来找你说："你违反了一条规定。因此，我要取消你的加薪。我要把你降到更低的级别。你的合同可能不会续签。你最好好好表现。"

于是你开始说："对不起、对不起、对不起。"但你的悲伤是被对后果的恐惧所驱动的。是被愤怒和自我憎恨所驱动的。

"你为什么要那样做？你这个笨蛋"——你对自己说。你甚至可能对你的老板生气，觉得他不够宽容或者在某些方面不公平。

但如果一位父亲来到你面前说："儿子，女儿，你违背了我。但这丝毫不改变我对你的爱。你知道我过去为你做了什么，将来我也会继续这样做。"

"我要你悔改，因为我要你来拥抱我。我想要消除我们之间的距离。那什么时候可以呢？"

你说："父亲，我很抱歉。"这时发生的事情是，你的悲伤被一种完全不同的东西驱动。它被爱驱动。被感恩的喜乐驱动。被恩典驱动。真正悔改的发动机——那种释放人而不是杀死人的悔改——是什么？

就是通过主耶稣基督认识神作为父亲，因为祂是你的救主。就是对基督舍命之爱的敬拜赞美。

## 饶恕人是真悔改的试金石

It's knowing God as father through the Lord Jesus Christ because he's your savior. It's adoration for the dying love of Christ. God.

Now, Jesus Christ gives us a test. A real acid test as to whether or not you really have been forgiven. You really have repented. You know what the acid test is?

You will be forgiving. You'll be forgiving. Jesus Christ says, if you do not forgive, you won't be forgiven.

Now, that doesn't mean God's looking down and saying, well, here's nice people over here and I will. They earned my forgiveness. That's not what he means. What Jesus is saying is, if you have stopped forgiving, you've stopped repenting.

Jesus says, I will forgive anyone who repents, but people who don't forgive show they've stopped repenting and therefore they get no forgiveness. Did you follow that?

Look, if for some strange reason, tonight you would find out that some distant relative you didn't even know exists died and has left you $10 million. And a friend of yours calls up five minutes later and says, hey, you know that $20 I lent you yesterday?

I'm really sorry I haven't paid back. I'll give it back to you tomorrow. If you have any kind of heart, if you have any kind of normal human processes going on down there, you'll say, I don't care about your $20. Forget the $20. Who cares about the $20?

---

现在，耶稣基督给了我们一个测试。一个真正的试金石，来检验你是否真的被饶恕了，是否真的悔改了。你知道这个试金石是什么吗？

你会饶恕人。你会饶恕人。耶稣基督说：如果你不饶恕人，你就不会被饶恕。

这并不意味着神在天上往下看说："嗯，这边是好人，我就饶恕他们。他们赚得了我的饶恕。"祂不是那个意思。耶稣所说的是：如果你停止饶恕别人，你就停止了悔改。

耶稣说：我愿意饶恕任何悔改的人。但不饶恕别人的人表明他们已经停止了悔改，因此他们得不到饶恕。你跟上了吗？

看，假如因为某个奇妙的原因，今晚你发现一个你甚至不知道存在的远房亲戚去世了，给你留下了一千万美元。五分钟后你的一个朋友打电话来说："嘿，你知道我昨天借你的那二十块钱吗？"

"我真的很抱歉我还没还。我明天就还你。"如果你有一颗正常的心，如果你的内心有任何正常的人性反应，你会说："我才不在乎你那二十块钱。忘了那二十块钱吧。谁在乎那二十块钱？"

"你知道我身上发生了什么事吗？"因为任何一个获得了意料之外的、完全自发的、不是赚来的、白白恩赐的财富的人，都会变得慷慨。耶稣基督说：我这样就能知道你是否真正在我的怜悯中富足了——你在饶恕人。你对人说："我不会因这件事记恨你。我不会不断地追究你对我所做的事。我不会对你保留我的情感。"

"我不会与你保持距离。我要承担那个代价。我要饶恕。"

这是神知道你是否真正在怜悯中富足的唯一方式。这也是你自己知道是否已经领受了祂的怜悯的方式之一。

## 三个实用的悔改方法

Do you know what happened to me? Because any person who has come into unlooked for, absolutely spontaneous, unearned, gracious wealth, becomes generous. And Jesus Christ says, here's how I can tell whether you've ever really been rich in my mercy. You're forgiving. You say to people, I'm not going to hold this against you. I'm not going to constantly keep you liable for what you've done to me. I'm not going to withhold my affection from you.

I'm not going to stand back away from you. I'm going to absorb the cost. I am going to forgive.

That's the only way God can know whether you're rich in mercy. And it's one of the ways in which you can know whether you've received his mercy. In conclusion, let me just tell you three quickie ways to repent and then we're done. Quickies.

Number one, notice that Jesus Christ says debts, not just debt. Do not sit down and say, oh Lord Jesus Christ, forgive me for all my sins. Amen. And think that that's going to clean you out. Think that that's going to bring any of the freedom and sweetness that Paul talks about. No. You want to hear something?

Here's a little bit of advice from Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter, who teaches Sunday school, and obviously teaches Sunday school very well, says this. If all I can do is find it. No, I have to find it first. Yes. Jimmy Carter says, don't say, Lord, forgive all my sins.

I don't believe it works unless you're willing to be specific. Say, God, today I was not kind to my spouse. God, in this business transaction, I cheated. God, today I didn't pray. God, today I told two lies and I misled a few people. God, today I had a chance to forgive somebody who hurt me and I didn't. God, today I think I have used my money selfishly.

Enumerate them. Call them by name. And under these circumstances, all sins are wiped away. Jimmy Carter said that. He says, don't just say, forgive me for my sin. Forgive me for my debts. Specific.

So the first thing is be specific. Second little pointer. Make sure you understand that your repentance doesn't start until you take all the responsibility. Repentance doesn't start until you stop your blame. And really call sins by the real name. You know why I tend to want here for us to say, forgive us our debts instead of forgive us our trespasses. Debts is a better translation.

Because a trespass is something that's sort of active and active breaking into a forbidden area. But a debt is just a failure to give someone what you owe. It's a failure to meet your responsibilities. And what are your responsibilities to a God who's created you and keeps you alive every second?

On whom you are dependent. And for every dimension of your being. What do you owe a God like that?

Everything. And so, you see, the sense of responsibility is you do not really ask God for forgiveness until you stop shifting the blame. If you say, well, Lord, forgive me, but boy, you should have seen how I was treated. If you have a log on your shoulder and the other part of it's on the ground, just try to throw that log off. It'll probably hurt you. If you want to throw a log, you've got to put the whole weight, the weight of it, on your shoulder and then you can heave it. And if you want to get rid of your sins, you've got to put them all on your back and then they can come off.

My wife and I rented a movie called Dad with Jack Lemmon, Ted Danson, a fairly recent movie. And the best part of the movie, the height of it, is where Ted Danson's now adult son asks him this, why was making money always more important to you than Mom and me?

And Danson looks at him and says, why was it so important to you? And he says, because I was a kid. And he says, because I thought that's what a man was. I thought a man had to get out there and earn, you know, support his family. I thought that's what a man did and I was wrong.

And then suddenly he realizes what he's doing and he looks down and he says, no, no, no. He says, because it made me feel powerful and being with my family did not and I wanted to go out there and feel powerful, please be forgiving. And at that moment, you see, he unmasked the sin. He didn't blame the shit. He didn't say, well, yeah, I did that, but, you know, I learned that from my culture, what a man is. No, he called it by name. He took full responsibility.

And at that moment, there's reconciliation and transformation between he and his son. You know, don't say, oh, Lord, forgive me for the fact that I worry too much. Call it by name. Say, Lord, I think that I do a better job of running my life than you. I have a better plan for history than you, all wise, almighty. Start calling it by name and you'll laugh at yourself at certain points and it'll, just like you started, I mean, it breaks the spell. Take responsibility.

And then, lastly, don't forget that you're confessing your sins to a father. If you go and just feel crushed under the weight of your sins, you're forgetting this is a father. Luke 15 tells us what it means to go to a father. It means to go confident of forgiveness. If you say, I just feel too small and too wicked for God to forgive me, that is arrogance. Do you really think your sins are any match for his mercy?

Really? Are they that big?

Hmm? When the father, when the prodigal son in Luke 15 comes back to see the father, don't you see what happens to the father?

The father, fathers love us even when we sin. And fathers don't stop being fathers. And fathers can't wait to receive us back. And fathers even interrupt the confession. You know, the prodigal son comes back to start to try to do his confession and the father won't even let him finish. He's already on him. He's already hugging him.

He's already kissing him. He's already saying, bring out the robe, bring out the ring, bring out the fatted calf, let's have a banquet. You don't see the father saying, oh my gosh, here's my prodigal son. He looks awful. I'm so mad at him.

Well, pull yourself together. It's your duty to love him. No. Because the father's love is uproarious. The father's love is invincible. And the father's love is not based on your perfection or your beauty. It's based on his perfection and his beauty.

It doesn't spring from what you are. It springs from what he 's perfect. My appeal, dear friends, where are you?

最后，让我快速告诉你们三个悔改的实际方法，然后我们就结束。简短的要点。

**第一，要具体。** 注意，耶稣基督说的是"债"（复数），不是"债"（单数）。不要坐下来说："主耶稣基督啊，饶恕我所有的罪。阿们。"然后以为这就能洁净你了。以为这就能带来保罗所说的那种自由和甘甜。不。你想听一点建议吗？

这是来自吉米·卡特的一点建议。吉米·卡特教主日学，而且显然教得非常好。他这样说——让我先找到它。不，我必须先找到它。好的。吉米·卡特说："不要说'主啊，饶恕我所有的罪'。"

"除非你愿意具体指名，否则我不相信它会有效。说：'神啊，今天我对配偶不够好。神啊，在这笔生意中我欺骗了人。神啊，今天我没有祷告。神啊，今天我说了两个谎言，还误导了几个人。神啊，今天我有一个饶恕伤害我的人的机会，但我没有饶恕。神啊，今天我觉得我自私地使用了我的金钱。'"

把它们一一列举出来。逐项指名。在这种情况下，所有的罪都被涂抹了。吉米·卡特说了这番话。他说：不要只是说"饶恕我的罪"。"饶恕我的债。"要具体。

所以第一件事是要具体。**第二个要点：你必须承担全部责任。** 确保你明白，你的悔改要到你承担了全部责任之后才算开始。悔改在你停止推卸责任之前不会真正开始。要用真正的名称来称呼罪。你知道为什么我倾向于在这里用"免我们的债"而不是"免我们的过犯"。"债"是一个更好的翻译。

因为"过犯"是一种主动闯入禁区的行为。但"债"只是未能偿还你所欠的。是未能尽到你的责任。那么，你对一位创造了你、每时每刻维持你生命的神所负有的责任是什么呢？

你在每一个生命层面都倚赖着祂。你欠这样一位神什么呢？

一切。所以你看，承担责任的意思是：你不会真正地向神求饶恕，直到你停止推卸责任。如果你说："嗯，主啊，饶恕我吧，但主你真应该看看别人怎么对我的。"如果你把一根木头一端扛在肩上、另一端还拖在地上，你试着把那根木头扔掉——它可能会伤到你。如果你想扔一根木头，你得把它的全部重量放到你肩上，然后你才能把它甩出去。如果你想摆脱你的罪，你得先把它们全部扛在自己背上，然后它们才能被卸下。

我妻子和我租了一部叫《爸爸》的电影，主演是杰克·莱蒙和泰德·丹森，是一部比较新的电影。这部电影最精彩的部分、最高潮的部分，是泰德·丹森已经成年的儿子这样问他："为什么赚钱对你来说总是比妈妈和我更重要？"

丹森看着他说："为什么它对你那么重要？"他说："因为我还是个孩子。"丹森说："因为我以为那就是男人应该做的。我以为男人就得出去赚钱，养家糊口。我以为那才是男人该做的事。我错了。"

然后他突然意识到自己在做什么。他低下头说："不、不、不。"他说："因为那让我感到有力量，而跟家人在一起却不能。我就是想出去寻找那种权力感。请饶恕我。"在那一刻，你看到了，他揭开了罪的面纱。他没有推卸责任。他没有说："嗯，是啊，我那样做了，但那是我从文化中学来的，男人就该那样。"不，他用真正的名称称呼了它。他承担了全部责任。

在那一刻，他和他的儿子之间产生了和好与转变。你知道，不要说："主啊，饶恕我太过忧虑了。"要用真正的名称来称呼它。说："主啊，我觉得我比你更善于掌管我的人生。我比你——全智全能者——有一个更好的历史计划。"开始用真名称呼它，你会在某些时候忍不住笑自己。它就会——就像你开始的时候那样——我是说，它打破了那个魔咒。承担责任。

**第三，不要忘记你是在向一位父亲认罪。** 如果你去了只是感觉被自己的罪压得喘不过气来，你就忘记了这是一位父亲。路加福音15章告诉我们去找一位父亲意味着什么。意味着带着对饶恕的确信去。如果你说"我觉得自己太渺小、太邪恶了，神不会饶恕我"，那就是骄傲。你真的以为你的罪能匹敌祂的怜悯吗？

真的吗？它们有那么大吗？

嗯？当那位父亲——当路加福音15章中的浪子回来见父亲时，你难道没看到父亲身上发生了什么吗？

> "相离还远，他父亲看见，就动了慈心，跑去抱着他的颈项，连连与他亲嘴。"
> ——路加福音 15:20

父亲们即使在我们犯罪的时候也爱我们。父亲们不会停止做父亲。父亲们迫不及待地想要接我们回来。父亲们甚至会打断认罪。你知道吗，浪子回来开始试着认罪，父亲连让他说完都不肯。他已经扑上去了。他已经在拥抱他了。

他已经在亲吻他了。他已经在说：

> "把那上好的袍子快拿出来给他穿；把戒指戴在他指头上；把鞋穿在他脚上；把那肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝快乐。"
> ——路加福音 15:22-23

你没有看到父亲说："哦天哪，我的浪子回来了。他看起来太糟糕了。我好生气。"

"好吧，振作一下。爱他是你的义务。"不。因为父亲的爱是热烈奔放的。父亲的爱是不可战胜的。父亲的爱不是建立在你的完美或你的美丽上。而是建立在祂的完美和祂的美丽上。

它不是源于你是什么。它源于祂是什么……是完美的。

## 悔改是苦尽甘来

Are you in a situation that there's a lot of bitterness in your life? You say, I've tried to confess. It could be in many of your cases. I'm talking to my fellow believers here. It could be that you need a look. Are you sure you're really confessing your sins or are you just driven by fear?

Are you confessing your sins or are you just full of self-pity instead of saying, it's you that I have dishonored and hurt? Or are you just sitting around thinking about the mess you've gotten yourself into?

Are you being specific? Are you looking at his mercy?

Are you remembering he's your father? Repentance is bittersweet. It starts out bitter, but as you drink it down and as you throw the cross in, it becomes sweet.

There's this one place in the Lord of the Rings where Tolkien says, and their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed and their joy was like swords and they passed and fought out the regions where pain and delight flow together and tears flowed and the tears of the very wine of blessedness. You know, only a Christian can know how great and sweet tears can taste. That sort of statement makes no sense to you unless you know repentance. Real repentance. Humble yourself under his mighty hand and he will exalt you in due time. And there's some of you maybe who have never repented who are here today. That is, you may have said your prayers, you might have done formal repentance, you might have engaged in self-pity or regret, you might have been hating yourself because you haven't lived up to standards, but you've never, you've never, actually repented of your real sin, which is never having repented.

亲爱的朋友们，我呼吁你们，你们现在在哪里？

你是否处于一种生命中充满苦毒的境况？你说："我已经试过认罪了。"在你们很多人的情况中——我在对我的信徒同伴说——可能是你们需要重新审视一下。你确定你真的在认罪吗？还是你只是被恐惧驱动？

你在认罪吗？还是你只是充满了自怜，而不是说"是你，我亏负了你、伤害了你"？还是你只是坐在那里想着你给自己造成的那个烂摊子？

你有具体认罪吗？你有注视祂的怜悯吗？

你记得祂是你的父亲吗？悔改是先苦后甜的。它一开始是苦的，但当你饮下它、当你把十字架投入其中，它就变甜了。

在《魔戒》中有一个地方，托尔金这样写道："他们的心被甘美的话语刺透而满溢，他们的喜乐如利剑一般。他们穿行在痛苦与欢愉交汇的地方，泪水涌流——而那泪水正是蒙福的美酒。"你知道，唯有基督徒才知道眼泪可以尝起来多么伟大、多么甘甜。这种说法对你毫无意义，除非你认识悔改。真正的悔改。

> "所以，你们要自卑，服在神大能的手下，到了时候，他必叫你们升高。"
> ——彼得前书 5:6

## 悔改进入生命：最伟大的恩赐

Your real sin, which is never having gone and said, the real sin is my desire to be in charge of my own life and my desire to live up to standards and not, I don't want your grace and I don't want your charity and that's the reason my repentance is killing me instead of healing me. Oh Lord, I want to make you my master. I want to receive you as Savior. Come into my life.

The Bible says the day you do that, that's called repentance unto life. And you'll know what it means to have God say to you in your heart, go, your faith has healed you. Let us pray. Our Father, now, we ask that you would lead everybody here to repentance. Some of us, some of us need to be led into a true kind of repentance, not a self-flagellation, but rather a going to God, going to you and seeing your fatherly love and seeing in confidence of that and seeing your love for us, shedding the things that are in our lives. If we go to you like that and ask for forgiveness and consider what you've done for us, it will clean us out.

A lot of us, Father, are just too busy hating ourselves, too busy trying to be our own saviors, too busy trying to earn our forgiveness the Smith-Barney way, Father. Help us to repent aright so we can say, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And Father, there's some here who may have never repented. Grant us a right and grant them repentance unto life, the greatest gift of all. And we pray that in Jesus' name. Amen.

也许在座有些人从未真正悔改过。也就是说，你可能做过祷告，你可能做过形式上的悔改，你可能沉溺于自怜或后悔之中，你可能一直在恨自己因为你没有达到标准。但你从来没有——你从来没有——真正为你真正的罪悔改过。那真正的罪，就是你从来没有悔改过。

你真正的罪，就是你从未走到神面前说："真正的罪是我想要掌管自己的生命。我想要靠自己达到标准。我不要你的恩典，我不要你的施舍——这正是我的悔改在杀死我而不是医治我的原因。主啊，我愿意让你作我的主。我愿意接受你作我的救主。请进入我的生命。"

圣经说，你这样做的那一天，那就叫作"悔改进入生命"。你就会明白当神在你心中对你说"去吧，你的信救了你"时，那是什么意思。

## 结束祷告

---

让我们祷告。我们的天父，现在，我们求你带领这里每一个人进入悔改。我们当中一些人需要被引导进入一种真正的悔改——不是自我鞭打，而是到神面前来、到你面前来，看到你天父般的爱，并且在对这份爱的确信中，看到你对我们的爱，从而卸下我们生命中那些东西。如果我们这样到你面前来求饶恕，并且思想你为我们所做的一切，它就会洁净我们。

天父，我们当中很多人只是忙于恨自己、忙于试图做自己的救主、忙于试图用"史密斯巴尼式"的方式赚取饶恕。天父，帮助我们正确地悔改，使我们可以说："免我们的债，如同我们免了人的债。"天父，这里可能有一些人从未悔改过。赐他们悔改进入生命的恩典——那最伟大的恩赐。我们奉耶稣的名如此祷告。阿们。
