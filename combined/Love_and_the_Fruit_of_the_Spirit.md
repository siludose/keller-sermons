# Love and the Fruit of the Spirit / Love and the Fruit of the Spirit

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Many of us try to change through sheer willpower, conquering bad habits or forcing better behavior, only to find ourselves snapping back to old patterns. In today's message, Tim Keller is exploring the fruit of the Spirit, showing how real transformation isn't about moral restraint, but a heart that through Christ is changed from the inside out.

The Scripture reading for today is taken from the Book of 1 Corinthians chapter 13, verses 1 through 13. If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging symbol. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains but have not love, I am nothing.

If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails, but where there are prophecies, they will cease, where there are tongues, they will be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.

When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face.

Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain, faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.

This is the word of the Lord. Now when you hear that read, you immediately look for the bridesmaids, the flower girl. And you know even though it is a great passage for a wedding, especially the center of that text when it describes love, you could not have a better guide for how to conduct a marriage than that.

So it is fine to do that, but I want you to know right now Paul did not write this for weddings. He wrote this about change. So almost all of us, almost all of us, have parts of our lives we really want to see changed.

But change is really hard. If you take a coke can and you crush it with your hand so that now it is taking up less space, it is smaller. And you take your hand away, it stays where you put it.

But if you take a rubber ball and squeeze it with your hand so it takes up less space, then you take your hand away, it snaps right back to where it was. Why? Because the rubber ball, you restrained it temporarily, but you did not really change it.

You changed the coke can, but you did not really change the rubber ball. You just restrained it and it snaps back. Now almost all of us have that experience, the rubber ball experience, I mean, we go out to try to change parts of our lives and we put a lot of willpower behind it.

And we put a lot of pressure on certain parts of our lives. We say I think I got it. And then as soon as you let up, or circumstances change, it snaps right back.

And this is also true of Christians. It's also true of Christians. That's the message of this passage.

In Galatians chapter 5, Paul lists nine, what he calls fruit of the Spirit. Nine character traits, love, joy, peace, patience, and so on. That are the results of a supernaturally changed heart, a permanently changed heart.

They are traits that can't be produced by willpower. And yet here in this passage, I think Paul is showing us that it is very possible to mistake a morally restrained heart for a supernaturally changed heart. To mistake it.

And we're so shocked when we find it hasn't really, we haven't really changed. We've been restraining ourselves through our willpower, we haven't actually changed from the inside. And what we're going to do over the next few weeks is we're going to do a series on the fruit of the Spirit.

We're going to take each of those nine fruit that Paul talks about in Galatians 5. And each week, we're going to look at one of them as a sign of, and as a mark of a supernaturally changed heart to help us understand what it means to develop such a heart. But here today, this passage, in some ways, is very simple.

In other ways, it's very profound. And as always, when you actually delve into see what it's actually saying, since we are used to reading it at weddings, it's always kind of a shock. But what this is about is to tell us what a supernaturally changed heart is not and what it is and how it comes.

A supernaturally changed heart is, first of all, not the same as a busy life in service of others. And secondly, it's not the same as a morally committed life. That's in verses 1, 2, and 3.

But then lastly, a supernaturally changed life is to meet love as a power and as a person. So, that's what we're going to learn. Supernaturally changed our heart.

It's not the same as a busy active life. It's not the same as the morally committed life. It's meeting love as a power and a person, first.

Verse 1 and 2. Paul makes a list of things that really are abilities, their talents, their gifts. If I speak in a tongues of men and of angels, or if I have the gift of prophecy, if I can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that moves mountains, let's go down that list.

The first part, he's talking about the things that he's been discussing in chapter 12, 1 Corinthians. He's talking about what we might call the miraculous gifts or the extraordinary gifts. He's talking about prophecy and miracles and getting revelations from God.

And we're not going to go into that even though some of you might like me to go into it. We're not going to go into it. We're just going to see what he says about that.

Those are very, very spectacular gifts. And then he talks about fathoming all mysteries. And Pauline language means understanding God's revelation and particularly the Bible.

So here he's talking about a person who's gifted at understanding and teaching the Bible. Then thirdly, he says, faith to move mountains. Now, that's not the normal kind of faith that we need in order to connect to God.

Faith to move mountains is visionary faith. It's inspiring faith. It's faith that inspires people.

Paul's talking about talents and gifts, artistic gifts, academic gifts, leadership gifts. And the Corinthian church was filled with them because Corinth was like New York in some ways. It was an urban center.

It was a financial center. It was a place in which people came to excel. And as a result, it was filled with smart talented people.

And therefore, the church was filled with smart talented people and it was a growing church. And it was constantly serving people and it was helping people. And everybody was very, very active.

And Paul shockingly says it's possible to even have miraculous gifts like prophecy. It's possible to have tremendous leadership gifts, tremendous preaching and teaching gifts without love. It's possible to be doing all of this not out of love.

Now you say, what do you mean? What does that mean? Well, here's what it means.

If we can skip for a second ahead, verses 4 to 7, which is the guts of the text, where it says, love is patient, kind, does not envy, does not boast. You know what he's actually giving us here? If you read the entire rest of 1 Corinthians, you know that verses 4 to 7 is a list of everything the Corinthian Christians are not.

They're impatient. They're unkind. They're rude.

They're boastful. They're bragging. They're condescending.

They're gifted. They're talented. They're successful.

They're starting new ministries and starting new nonprofits. Do they have them like that? And they're doing things for people, but they're character and their attitudes.

They're cranky. They're crabby. They're impatient.

They're condescending. They're always having fights. They're always hurting to those feelings.

They're always getting their noses bent out of shape. And Paul says, that is not insignificant. Boy, do we need to hear this now?

See, like Corinth, we live in an urban culture. And let's face it, in New York, what really counts? What really counts?

Are you smart? Are you the best? Can you produce?

Okay, so you got character flaws. Well, you're a colorful character. Okay, I was just reading a book by a wife of a former of a man who's now gone, Norman Miller.

Did you read that? His last wife and she's written a biography. And of course, Norman Miller was a brilliant author and everybody came out to listen to him and he ran for mayor.

Okay, so he stabbed one of his wives with a knife. He's a colorful character. See, what really matters is he has the gift.

He has the talent. And Paul totally reverses that and he says, no, it's the other way around. He says, if you're brilliant, if you're gifted, if you're talented, even in God's service, even doing all this for God, but in your heart, you're filled with envy and pride and anger and insecurity.

You're nothing. That is of no value to God at all. And actually, one of the things that's most frightening here, I mean, this is a very direct statement.

He's trying to say it's possible to have little grace in the heart. That means to have given God very little of your heart and yet be very successful in ministry. That's what this is saying.

And it's even saying it's possible to be successful in ministry and not having and not actually given your given God your heart at all. At one point, he says, you're nothing. It's possible to be nothing.

You know, in Matthew 721, there's a place where Jesus says, on the last day, some people are going to come to me and they're going to say, Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name? These people prophesy, just like first Corinthians, prophesy. And did we not cast out devils and demons?

And didn't we in my name do many wonderful works? And I will say to them, I never knew you. Now you see, how could a person be a great preacher, cast out demons, and actually have God's spirit help people through that person and not even be actually have ever given God his heart at all?

Is that possible? Sure it is. Hey, look, you know, people need help, right?

If you're going out there and in your heart, you're still filled with pride, you're still filled with anger, you're still filled with all sorts of inner self-centeredness and self-absorption, and you're out there trying to help people, you know, maybe God will, God's spirit will use you. Why not? Temporarily, why not?

People need help. But don't you dare, Paul says, look at that and say, God's with me. And that's scary.

So the first thing we see here is a supernaturally changed heart, though it will always lead to a life of service. We got to remember that you must not identify with a life of service because you can have a life of service without having a supernaturally changed heart, that's 0.1, 0.2. Let's move on to chapter 3.

The second thing we learn here is you mustn't mistake a supernaturally changed heart for a morally committed heart, a life. So it says in verse 3, now he's moving on, and if I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not loved, I gain nothing. Now this is very interesting.

These are not talents, are they? He's moved away from the talent and gift list, and now he's moved into what the Greek philosophers would call a virtue list, a list of virtues. And Aristotle has them, they all had them, you know, prudence and self-control and justice and wisdom, and so, and Paul gives us a kind of mini-list and it's quite powerful, a list of virtues.

Now we're talking about moral fortitude, moral commitment. On the one hand he says, if I give all I possess to the poor, now today we would call that a liberal virtue, social justice, but by the way, look at it. It's not just, you know, a charitable handout, if I give all my possessions to the poor, here's someone so committed to the poor that he or she is living in voluntary poverty, just living in voluntary poverty, it gives away most are all of what you have and just lives with the poor.

Isn't that something? Wow, that's virtue. And on the other hand, and if I surrender, surrender my body to the flames, then what's that?

See that's dying for your faith, going to the lions, going to the stake, and that's what most people would call a conservative virtue in a way because to stand up for your faith and to die for your faith, you know, that's the sort of thing that people consider kind of traditional religion. So here you have the list. Paul says, I say, name me all the virtues, name me all the moral commitments there are.

It's possible to do that without any love in your heart at all, not out of love and therefore, before God, it's spiritually valueless. It's nothing. Now, so Paul actually says, here's a virtue list and that's as valueless.

Again, let's get this straight, a supernaturally changed heart will lead to a morally committed life but you can easily have a morally committed life without a supernaturally changed heart at all and it's very, very easy to mistake one for the other. Now, how does that work? Well, go up to verse one.

Almost everybody goes right on by this. If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not loved, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging symbol. Now, what's so bad about, have you ever thought about that?

What's so bad about a symbol? I love the symbols. Don't you love the symbols?

What's so bad about that? What's hollow about that? What's, what is that?

That verse makes no sense unless, as the commentators say, it's referring to the worship of the various temples of those Greco-Roman cities like in Corinth. They had all the various gods, they had all the various pagan temples and the way worship was done was a great processional in which there were gongs and there were symbols and that you were wearing your finery, it was a parade and the purpose of it was to honor the god, to get the gods attention, to get the gods approval. Look how much we venerate you, you know, look at it.

And Paul says, do you know it's possible to do not only Christian ministry but to do, but also to practice Christian ethics and virtue, it's possible to obey the thing commandments and go to church and get active in church and try to help people and do it to get gods approval. You're not doing it for God's sake, you're not doing it just because you love Him for who He is in Himself, you're trying to get things from God and you're not helping the people for their sake, you're helping them for your sake, you're trying to get the applause, you're trying to get the approval. And Paul is saying here the telltale sign that though you're morally committed in the broad sense and you are active in helping other people and giving your money away to charity and the poor and all that in the broad sense, yet the telltale sign that you're doing it for you, you're not doing it out of love, you're not doing it for love of God or love for other people, it's all about you is the erasiveness, it's the rudeness, it's the stepping on each other's toes, you know, churches, these are churches, a comment is the typical church, people who are broadly moral and very active in serving God and other people and have the people aren't speaking to each other because they're so mad at the others.

The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God, even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Kellers 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start and if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

Kellers with the rest of today's teaching. There's the gossip, there's the backbiting, there's the envy, there's the rudeness, there's the boasting, there's the bragging, there's the critical spirits, there's the impatience, there's the abrasiveness, the self-pitting, the self-absorption, the vanity, the anxiety, the insecurity, it's all there. All underneath all of the morality, yeah, they're moral and underneath all the service, yeah, they're very active and Paul says that's absolutely deadly and he say, well, how can that be?

Well, let's let me give you what I still think is the best way to understand this. Let's think about, let's do a case study, let's think about how we actually teach children to be honest and not to lie. How do we do that?

We appeal to two things, fear and pride. We ratchet up fear and pride. Now there's two ways, first of all, and we're talking about anywhere, public schools, church, synagogue, wherever.

How do we teach children not to lie? We're home, family. One is we appeal to fear.

We say you'll get caught, the teacher will catch you, the police will catch you, God will catch you, and worse, I will catch you. Worse than all of that, I will catch you. So what are we doing?

We're ratchet. It will not pay. It will not pay.

You're going to get it. Your sins will find you out. Your lies will find you out.

So the first thing is you get them scared. You say you better not lie if you lie and you get, it won't pay for you. That's fear.

The other thing to do is pride. It is you can appeal to pride and you can say to the child, you know why you should tell the truth because you don't want to be like those awful liars, liars. And sometimes if we catch the child instead of just saying what you do is wrong, we shame them.

Why are? Because, and what are we trying to do? We're trying to get the child to be truthful by getting the child to disdain a certain kind of person.

Liars. Liars. You liar.

So now let's think about what is fear and pride? What is fear and pride? It's self-centeredness.

It's enhancing a person's self-centeredness. It's teaching them to look down to certain people. It's teaching them to think about.

And you know, here's what's going on. What is wrong with the world? It's self-centeredness.

It's the impulse of every human heart that goes me, me, me first. What about me? That's self-centeredness.

And instead of putting a stake, you know, a wooden stake in the heart of self-centeredness, the way in which we teach people to be good is we enhance the self-centeredness and then jury-rig it so that it's keeping the kid or the person from telling, you know, from doing wrong. But let's think for a second, everybody. Why do we lie?

There's lying everywhere. There's deception everywhere. There's corruption everywhere.

There's embezzling everywhere. It's awful. Okay, why do we lie?

Fear and pride are the reasons we lie. We lie when we're afraid of losing face or when we're afraid of losing power or afraid of losing something and we lie out of pride. I feel like I can pull the wool over these people's eyes.

I can, you know, these people don't deserve it. I can do this. I can do that.

And so when you enhance in a person's life, fear and pride in order to get them to lie, you're actually setting them up eventually too. I mean, tell the truth. You're setting them up eventually to lie because something will change.

Something will come along. You'll take your hand off of the rubber ball and it'll snap back and you'll say, and after you've embezzled or after you've lashed out or after you've cheated on your spouse and you can say, what did I do that for? I wasn't raised that way.

Yes, you were. We're all raised that way. That's how we get people to be good.

We squeeze that little rubber ball through fear and pride, but it doesn't really change it. It doesn't change the self-centeredness. It enhances it.

It doesn't change. It doesn't destroy it. It doesn't want to stay through its heart.

And that's the reason why you see in the short run, people being moral, but having all of these underlying tell-tale signs, the unkindness, the impatience, the grumpiness, the crabbyness, you know, they're always being hurt. They're always having your feeling hurt. Your ego is always being hurt.

See, that's the tell-tale sign underneath the broad morality, but at some point, even the broad morality breaks through for as many of us, many of us. So many people, the good, I mean, you know, why, for example, why is it that so many high-level public officials do the most ridiculous things fall to scandal and blow their entire careers up? It happens all the time every year, a couple, right?

You know why? Because they're being morally committed, huh? And they're being and they're being serving people, and they're giving their lives in public service.

And very often, because they're in public service, they're making far less money than the other people they want to graduate school with. We're making ten times more. And deep inside, what happens?

Self-pity, self-pity. They start to say, oh, nobody knows what I go through. And next thing, you know, there's the opportunity for, you know, cutting a corner here, taking some money here, having an affair over here, and the person says, I deserve it.

Was that come from? They come from the self-pity. It comes from the self-absorption.

It comes from what's going on inside the heart, in spite of the fact that the person out there is being, you know, so good. Paul says, it's absolutely deadly. Don't you see?

Don't you recognize it in yourself? You are settling for something that's going to blow up on you. And therefore, we see that even the list, the virtual list, you know, this is Aristotle's generosity, integrity, justice, prudence, self-control, they can all be done out of an inner joy or out of an inner emptiness.

Why do you think Jesus Christ said, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scraps and Pharisees, you can have nothing of me. He's trying to say, look at the scraps and Pharisees. Look at their kind of morality.

There's a kind of morality. It's morally restrained. You've got to go way deeper than that.

So how do we? 0.3. Get to verses 4 to 7 and we see really what a supernaturally changed heart is.

You have to meet love as both a power and a person. Now here's what I mean by that. It's actually stronger in the Greek than it comes across in English, but what's so striking about verses 4 to 7 is that Paul does not say, I want you to be patient.

I want you to be kind. I don't want you to envy. I don't want you to boast.

I want you to not be proud. It doesn't say that. Instead, he personifies love.

It's all transitive verbs. Love becomes an individual, a person. It says love, by the way, literally, verse 4 says, love suffers long.

That's patience. Love suffers long without you know, and bears it. Love is so kind.

Love does not envy. And love is a person doing this. Instead of saying, here's what I want you to be.

He gives us a picture of an active force, a personal force who's living in a particular way. Why is he doing that? Well, here, first of all, to get across the idea that real love only develops when you meet love.

Real love doesn't happen through trying, but through receiving and through meeting. What do I mean by that? Well, you know, if he actually said, now, here's what I want you to do, do these 10 things.

It would be a set of rules that we are supposed to pick up and try to do. But honestly, Paul is saying, no, love is not first something you do. It's a power that picks you up and changes you.

And I want you to know that this actually sounds very mystical and supernatural, but it's really not. If you think about it, here's what we know about children. Social scientists have studied this.

It's tragic. It always kind of, you know, moves you. But we know that if a child, if an infant is born and is put into an environment where the child's never picked up, never held, never loved, never cooed to, nobody ever does baby talk and smile at its face.

Now, the worst, if you don't love a child at all, as the child grows up, just what happens is the child say, well, I'm going to have to really know the child's incapable of love, basically. The child's broken. The child can't give or receive it.

We know that. In fact, in many cases, they die before they even grow. Why?

Because essentially, we learn to love by being loved. We don't just try. We learn to love by being loved.

The more we're loved, the more we can reflect love. It's just we know that. The more we're just embraced by love and surrounded by love and just flooded with love as we are born and grow up, the more we can do it.

Because before love is something you try to do, love is something you meet, something you receive. Love is not something that you try to do, but it's a power that picks you up and changes you. And that's really important.

And therefore, if we're really going to develop this love, it means we have to have a very powerful experience of love beyond. See, if we know that there's something wrong with us, we may have had the parental love so that we grew up as normally adjusted human beings in general. We know there's still stuff wrong with us, which means we need another kind of love infinitely higher than anything even the best parents could have given.

And we need to meet that love and we need to receive that love. If we're going to move ourselves, if we're going to be moved to another plane. So first of all, he personifies love to get across the idea that love is a power, but secondly, he personifies love to get us to think of a person.

Look, this isn't just poetry. This isn't just poetry when he says, love suffers long. Love is kind when he personifies love.

This isn't just poetry. I'll tell you why. If versus four to seven is nothing but a kind of abstract model, a picture of a perfectly loving person, if that's all it is, if Paul is saying, I want you to think about a person who is perfectly patient, incredibly kind, never boasts, never self-seeking, never keeps a record of wrongs.

If he's just laying in front of me an example of a perfectly loving person, I don't want it, and neither do you, because all you're going to do, are you going to say, wow, I can be like that? No, you're going to say, wow, I could never be like that. If you know any experience with your own heart, if versus four to seven is just giving us a general picture of a perfectly loving person, it'll crush you.

I don't want it. Let's tear it out. But I don't think Paul is.

For Paul to personify love, and then to imagine that he's not got a particular person in mind is to not know Paul at all. And here's what I want you to consider. When Paul wrote, love suffers long.

How could he not have been thinking about the one who said, my God, my God, why has thou forsaken me? There's infinite suffering. And when it says out of love, and when it says, love does not keep a record of wrongs, how could he not be thinking about the one who said, father forgive them?

They don't know what they're doing. They were killing him. They were killing him.

And he says, father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. And when he says, love always protects, always hopes, how could he not be thinking about the one who said, today, you'll be with me in paradise.

Even though he was being killed, even though he was dying, he was able to turn to someone, to turn to the thief on the cross and say, I want you with me in paradise. And when you see hope, when you see love perseveres, love perseveres. One of the most amazing things that Jesus said on the cross was it is finished.

Which as some of you know is a Greek word that means it's completed. It's been accomplished. It amazes me just as he's dying.

He says, it is finished. You know what he means? Here he is.

Here's a man in strip naked. Here's a man abandoned. Here's a man penniless.

Here's a man tortured. Here's a man powerless. Here's a man everyone is left.

And just before he dies, he says, I did it. I did it. What did he do?

He accomplished our salvation because he died on the cross in our place and took our punishment, which is a way of saying he refused to die until he had done what he'd come to do. Love perseveres. And by the way, love never fails.

And how in the world could anyone write that, especially St. Paul without thinking, as much as I love my wife, as much as I love my children, someday I'll be dead. Who could you really say, who could you speak about and say his love never fails?

There is only one. Jesus Christ said, I will never, never, never, never, never forsake you. That's in Hebrews.

And so we have that great hymn that goes, you know, that soul that all hell shall endeavor to shake. I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake. And how do you know that?

We know that because Jesus Christ took hell for us, even hell couldn't push him away from doing what he wanted to do for us. He did it. Now, here's the point.

You can look at verses four to seven as an abstract person who perfectly loves you. And that will never change your heart. It'll only crush you under guilt.

It'll just say, I'm going to have to really try hard if I'm going to be like this. Or you could see Jesus Christ being all of that things in the ultimate example of it on the cross loving doing all that for you. Not doing all that just as an example, but doing all that for you in your place as your savior.

And when you see that, what will that do? Do you believe that? Do you embrace that?

Do you take it in and think about that and sort of taste it on the palate of your heart, day and day out? Here's what's it's going to do. It's going to get rid of your fear every day a little bit more.

It's going to get rid of your fear. You're not going to be afraid of losing face. Who cares?

You're not going to be afraid of losing anything. So on the one hand, it's going to value you out of your fear because he loves you like that. But on the other hand, it's going to humble you out of your pride because you know he loves you in spite of everything.

And so if you look at love as an abstraction and just try to live up to it, it'll either fill you with pride because you think you're doing it or it'll fill you with fear because you know you're not. Or you could look at Jesus Christ doing it for you and that destroys your fear, destroys your pride and begins to regenerate your heart from the inside. So if you see Jesus Christ doing the love of verses 4 to 7 for you, eventually that love will be reproduced in you.

Let's go get a supernaturally changed heart. Let's begin right away. Let's pray.

Father, we thank you that this text is not at all like what we think it is. Of course, it is what it appears to be on the surface. It is a wonderful inventory of what it means to have a loving relationship.

It's a wonderful blueprint for how to run a marriage or any relationship or how to run all of our relationships. And yet it goes much deeper than that. It shows us that we have to meet your Son, Jesus Christ on the cross.

The ultimate example of suffering long, the ultimate example of not keeping a record of wrongs, the ultimate example of love that perseveres and never, never fails. It can't fail. There's no condemnation now for those who are in Christ Jesus.

And we pray, Lord, that we would be so melted by, affected by the love done for us that reproduces that same love in us as our fear and pride melt away over time. Lord, we would be willing to confess that to a great degree we have not been very affected by the gospel. And the cross and what Jesus has done.

And we want to begin to develop supernaturally changed hearts now. Meet us now. We pray this in Jesus' name.

Amen. Thanks for joining us here on the Gospel and Life Podcast. We hope that today's teaching encouraged you to go deeper into God's Word.

欢迎来到生命中的福音。我们很多人试图通过意志力来改变自己，克服坏习惯或强迫更好的行为，却发现最终还是回到了旧有的模式中。在今天的讲道中，提摩太·基勒（Tim Keller）将探讨圣灵的果子，展示**真正的转变不是**关于道德克制，而是通过基督从内到外被改变的心。今天经文选自哥林多前书第13章1至13节： 如果我说各种人间语言和天使的语言，却没有爱，我就成了响亮的钹声。

如果我有先知的能力，明白所有的奥秘和知识，甚至有信心能移动山岳，但没有爱，我还是什么都没有。即使我把所有财产都施舍给穷人，甚至把自己交给火，却没有爱，我也一无所得。爱是忍耐的，爱是慈祥的；它不嫉妒，不夸耀，不自大，不粗鲁，不寻求自己的利益，不轻易发怒，不记念别人的伤害。爱不做不义的事，只喜悦真理。

爱总是保护人，信任人，盼望人，坚持到底。爱永不失败，但当预言停止时，预言就会消失；当说方言的停止时，方言也会静默；当知识存在时，知识会消逝。因为我们现在是部分地知道，部分地预言；等那完全的来到，部分的就要过去了。当我还是小孩子的时候，我用儿童的语言思考和推理；当我成为大人后，我就把孩童的想法抛在脑后了。

如今我们只能透过镜子模糊地看见，那时我们会面对面清楚地看见。现在我只是一知半解，到那时我会完全明白，正如我现在被完全明白一样。如今剩下的有三个：信心、盼望和爱。但其中最大的是爱。

这是主的话语。当你们听到这段经文时，立刻就会想到新娘的伴娘和花童。即使这是一段非常适合婚礼的经文，特别是在描述爱的时候，你也不会找到比这更好的婚姻指导了。所以这样做是可以的，但我要告诉你们，保罗写这段话并不是为了婚礼，而是关于改变。

几乎所有的我们，几乎所有的我们，都有想让生活中的某些部分发生变化的愿望。但是改变真的很难。如果你把可乐罐捏扁了，让它占用更小的空间，然后把手拿开，它会保持在你放的位置上。但如果你捏一个橡胶球，让它缩小，然后把手拿开，它就会立刻弹回原来的样子。

为什么？因为橡胶球只是暂时被约束住了，并没有真正改变。你改变了可乐罐，但并没有真正改变橡胶球。你只是暂时把它压扁了，但它会反弹回来。

几乎所有的我们都有这样的经历——橡胶球的经历：我们出去尝试改变生活中的某些部分，投入了很多意志力。我们在生活的某些方面施加很大的压力，然后说：“我想我做到了。” 但是只要稍微放松一点，或者情况发生变化，它就会立刻弹回原样。这也适用于基督徒。

这也是基督徒的情况。这就是这段经文的信息。在《加拉太书》第五章中，保罗列出了九种他称之为圣灵果子的品质：爱、喜乐、和平、忍耐等等。这些是超自然改变内心、永久性改变内心的结果。

它们是无法通过意志力产生的特质。然而，在这段经文中，我认为保罗在向我们展示，很容易把道德上的自我约束误认为是超自然的改变。我们常常会震惊地发现，实际上并没有真正改变。我们只是依靠意志力来约束自己，并没有从内里真正改变。

接下来几周，我们将进行一系列关于圣灵果子的主题讨论。我们将逐一探讨保罗在加拉太书5章中提到的九种果子。每周，我们都会研究其中一种，作为超自然改变心灵的标志，帮助我们理解拥有这样一颗心意味着什么。但今天这段经文，在某种程度上非常简单，而在另一些方面则非常深刻。

当你真正深入去了解它在说什么时，你会发现，尽管我们在婚礼上经常读到它，仍然会感到惊讶。但这段经文要告诉我们的是：超自然改变的心灵是什么样的，又不是什么样的，以及它是如何来的。首先，一颗超自然改变的心灵并不是忙碌为他人服务的生活；其次，它也不是道德承诺的生活。这是在第1、2和3节中提到的。

最后，一颗超自然改变的生命是遇见爱的力量和人格。这就是我们要学习的内容——一颗被超自然改变的心灵。这颗心不是忙碌活跃的生活，也不是道德承诺的生活，而是遇见爱作为力量和个人。我们先来看第1和第2节。

保罗列出了许多能力、天赋或恩赐。如果我说出人间的语言和天使的语言，或者拥有预言的恩赐，能够洞察所有的奥秘和知识，甚至有能使山移的动力信仰，让我们看看这个列表。他首先提到的是他在哥林多前书12章中讨论过的内容，谈论的是我们所说的奇迹般的恩赐或非凡的恩赐。他提到了预言、神迹以及从上帝那里获得启示。

尽管有些朋友可能希望我详细解释这些内容，但我们今天不会深入探讨它们。我们将看看他对这些恩赐的看法。这些是非常非常壮观的能力。然后他提到洞察所有奥秘。

保罗的语言意味着理解上帝的启示，特别是圣经。所以这里他提到一个有圣经理解能力和教导能力的人。然后他说第三点，就是移山的信仰。这可不是我们通常用来与神连接的那种信仰。

移山的信仰是前瞻性的信仰。是鼓舞人心的信仰。是能够激励人的信仰。保罗在谈论天赋和恩赐，包括艺术天赋、学术天赋、领导才能。

而哥林多教会充满了这些人才，因为哥林多就像纽约一样，是一个城市中心。它是一个金融中心，一个人们来此追求卓越的地方。因此，那里充满了聪明有才华的人。所以教会里也充满了聪明有才华的人，并且是一所不断成长的教会。

他们一直在服务他人，帮助他人，每个人都很活跃。保罗惊人地说，甚至有可能拥有像预言这样的奇迹恩赐。有可能拥有巨大的领导才能、出色的讲道和教导能力，但没有爱。有可能做这一切都不是出于爱。

你可能会问：这什么意思？是什么意思？这里的意思是： 如果我们暂时跳到第4节至第7节，即这段经文的核心部分，那里说：“爱是忍耐的，慈爱的，不嫉妒，不自夸。”你知道他实际上在给我们列出什么吗？

如果你读完整个《哥林多前书》，你会发现第4节至第7节是一系列哥林多基督徒所不具备的品质。他们急躁。他们冷漠。他们粗鲁。

他们自大。他们吹嘘自己。他们轻视别人。他们有天赋，有才华，很成功。

他们在开展新的事工和非营利组织。但他们是否像这样？他们在为他人做事，但他们的品格和态度却不是这样。他们是易怒的。

他们是爱挑剔的。他们急躁。他们自以为是。他们总是吵架。

总是伤害别人的感情。他们总是在生闷气。保罗说，这并不是无关紧要的事。我们真的需要现在听到这个吗？

看看，就像哥林多一样，我们生活在一个都市文化中。那么，在纽约，到底什么是最重要的？什么是最重要的？你聪明吗？

你是最好的吗？你能创造什么？好吧，所以你有性格缺陷。好吧，你是一个有趣的角色。

好吧，我刚刚读了一本前人的妻子写的书，这个人现在已经不在了，名叫诺曼·米勒。你看过这本书吗？他的妻子写了一部传记。当然，诺曼·米勒是一位才华横溢的作家，大家都来听他演讲，并且他还竞选过市长。

好吧，所以他用刀刺伤了他的一个妻子。他是个有趣的角色。你看，真正重要的不是这些，而是他有天赋。他有才能。

保罗完全逆转了这一点，他说：“不，恰恰相反。” 他说：“如果你聪明、有才华、有天赋，在上帝的服务中，甚至为了上帝做了这一切，但在你心里充满了嫉妒、骄傲、愤怒和不安。” 那你什么都不是。这在上帝面前毫无价值。

实际上，这里最可怕的一点是，这是一个非常直接的陈述。他试图说，有可能内心只有很少一点恩典。**这意味着给上帝的心灵贡献很少，但仍然能在事工上取得很大的成功。**这就是这句话的意思。

甚至说，有可能在事工上取得很大成功，却完全没有真正把心献给上帝。有一次他说：“你什么都不是。” 有可能变得一无所有。你知道，在马太福音7章21节，耶稣说过，在最后的日子里，有些人会来见我，并说：“主啊，我们不是在你的名下预言吗？

我们在你的名下驱逐过邪灵和恶魔吗？” 并且“我们在你的名下做了许多奇迹。” 而我会对他们说：“我不认识你们。” 现在你明白了吗？

一个人可以成为伟大的传道人、驱逐邪灵，并且有上帝的精神通过这个人帮助别人，却从未真正把心献给上帝。这有可能吗？当然可能。嘿，你知道的，人们需要帮助，对吧？

如果你出去的时候，心里仍然充满骄傲、愤怒和各种自私自利的想法，却还想要去帮助别人，你知道的，也许上帝会使用你。为什么不呢？暂时为什么不行？人们需要帮助。

但保罗说，不要以为自己有了这一切就说：“上帝与我同在。”这很可怕。所以这里我们看到的第一个就是被神改变的心灵，尽管它总是会引导出一种服侍的生活。我们必须记住，不能因为有服侍的生活就认为自己有了被神改变的心灵——那只是0.1、0.2。

让我们继续看第三章的内容。这里学到的第二个要点是，你不能把被神改变的心灵误认为是一种道德上的承诺或生活方式。在第3节中，他说：“现在他开始说：即使我将所有财产都给了穷人，并且甘愿献出自己的身体作为祭物，但如果没有爱，我就什么都没有得到。”这非常有趣。

这不是才智或恩赐的问题吗？他已经离开了才智和恩赐的清单，转而进入了一种希腊哲学家会称之为美德的清单。亚里士多德和其他哲学家都有这些美德，比如审慎、自制力、公正和智慧，保罗给了我们一个简短但有力的列表。现在我们要讨论的是道德上的坚韧和承诺。

一方面他说：“即使我将所有财产都给了穷人。”今天我们会称这种行为为一种进步的价值观——社会正义，但是请注意，这不是简单的慈善施舍，而是如此致力于帮助穷人的程度以至于甘愿过着自愿贫困的生活，与穷人同在。这真是美德啊！另一方面，“如果我献出自己的身体作为祭物”，那又是什么意思呢？

看看，为信仰而死，去狮子口，赴火刑柱，这大概就是大多数人所说的保守美德了。因为为了信仰挺身而出，甚至为之献身，人们认为这是传统宗教的一种表现。所以保罗列出了这些：他说，你们说吧，把所有的美德都告诉我。但没有爱心的话，完全可以在没有任何爱的情况下做到这一切，并且因此，在神面前，这种行为毫无灵性价值，一文不值。

现在，保罗实际上说的是，这里有一份美德清单，但它毫无价值。让我们再明确一下，一个被圣灵改变的心灵会带来道德的生活，但这并不意味着没有被圣灵改变的人就无法过上道德的生活。很容易把两者混淆。那么，这又是如何运作的呢？

我们来看一下一节经文。几乎所有人都直接跳过了这一段。如果我说方言，甚至天使的语言，却没有爱，我不过是当响亮的钹声或刺耳的号角声罢了。你有没有想过这个问题？

有什么不对劲的地方吗？符号有什么错？我喜欢符号，你们不也喜欢符号吗？这有什么问题呢？

为什么是空洞的？这是什么？除非如注释家所说，这段经文指的是那些希腊罗马城市中的各种庙宇崇拜，比如哥林多城。他们有各种各样的神和庙宇，在崇拜时会有游行过程，伴随着钹声、符号和华丽的服饰，目的是为了荣耀神，吸引神的关注，获得神的恩宠。

看我们多么尊敬你啊！保罗说，你知道吗？不仅可以在基督教事工中做到这一点，还可以实践基督徒的伦理和美德。你可以遵守十诫、去教会积极参与，并努力帮助他人，但这一切都是为了得到上帝的认可。

你不是出于对上帝的爱去做这些事情，而是希望从上帝那里获得某种东西；你也不是真心为别人的福祉着想，而是为了自己的满足感，为了赢得他人的掌声和认可。保罗在这里指出，尽管你在道德上有所承诺，在帮助他人、捐款给慈善机构方面非常积极，但一个明显的迹象是你这样做是为了自己，而不是出于对上帝或对他人的爱。这种表现就是粗鲁无礼，踩踏别人的尊严，比如在教会里，人们因为彼此间的愤怒而不再交流。诗篇可以深刻地影响你与上帝的关系，甚至耶稣也曾依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。

在提摩太和凯西·凯勒的《365天灵修》中，你可以找到通过诗篇的每日读经，获得全新的圣经洞见。如果你还没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始；如果你已经花时间研读和祷告，那么阅读并祈祷诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到上帝面前，并与他建立更深的亲密关系。作为您对福音与生命事工支持的感谢，我们将赠送您提摩太和凯西·凯勒的灵修书。请访问我们的网站 gospelandlife.com/slash-give 获取您的副本。

现在，请听博士的话： Keller和其他今天的教导一样，充满了闲言碎语、背后议论、嫉妒、粗鲁、自夸、吹嘘、批评的态度、不耐烦、尖酸刻薄、自我贬低、自私自利、虚荣、焦虑和不安。所有这些都在所谓的道德规范之下，是的，他们看起来很讲道德；在所谓的服务行为之下，是的，他们非常活跃。保罗说这绝对是有毒的，并且他说：“那又如何？” 那么，让我给你解释一下我仍然认为最好的理解方式。

让我们做一个案例研究，考虑一下我们是如何教孩子诚实不撒谎的。我们依赖于两种方法：恐惧和自尊心。首先，无论是在公立学校、教会还是犹太会堂等任何地方，我们是如何教育孩子们不要撒谎的？在家里，当我们面对孩子时，一种方式是利用恐惧： 我们会说你会被抓住的——老师会发现你，警察会发现你，上帝会发现你，更糟糕的是我会发现你。

比这一切更糟糕的是我会发现你。那么我们在做什么呢？我们是在强化这种观念：撒谎不会有好结果。你的罪行会被揭露出来。

你的谎言会被揭露出来。所以第一件事就是让他们害怕。我们会说：“如果你撒谎了，你会受到惩罚。”这就是恐惧。

另一种方法是自尊心。我们可以利用孩子的自尊心来说服他们，告诉孩子你为什么应该说实话，因为你不想成为那些可恶的撒谎者。有时当我们抓住孩子时，并不仅仅是告诉他们行为不对，我们还会羞辱他们。为什么要这样做呢？

因为我们试图通过让孩子鄙视某些人来让他们变得诚实。撒谎的人。撒谎的人。你是撒谎的人。

那么现在让我们思考一下恐惧和自尊心是什么？恐惧和自尊心是什么呢？它们是自我中心的表现。它们是在增强一个人的自我中心。

它们在教孩子们看不起某些人，教他们关注自己。而且你知道，这就是问题所在。这个世界出了什么问题？是自私。

每个人内心深处的冲动都是“我、我、我”优先。这叫自私。与其在自私的心上钉一根木桩，我们教导人们做好人的方式却是增强他们的自私心，然后通过一些手段来防止他们做错事。但大家想一想，为什么我们会撒谎？

谎言无处不在，欺骗无处不在，腐败无处不在。挪用公款无处不在。这真是糟糕透顶。那为什么我们撒谎呢？

恐惧和傲慢是撒谎的原因。当我们害怕丢脸、害怕失去权力或害怕失去某些东西时，或者出于骄傲——我觉得我可以蒙蔽这些人的眼睛，他们不配得到这些，我能做到这一点，我能做到那一点，所以我们才会撒谎。当你通过恐惧和傲慢来增强一个人的生活，让他们撒谎，实际上是在为他们最终撒谎埋下伏笔。我说，说实话吧。

总有一天你会撒谎的，因为某件事会发生改变。事情会有所变化。你松开了橡胶球的手，它就会反弹回来，然后你说：“我为什么要这样做？我不是那样长大的。

” 是的，你是。我们都是这样长大的。这就是我们教导人们做好人的方法——通过恐惧和傲慢来挤压那个小小的橡胶球，但这并不能真正改变什么。它不能改变自私心，只会增强它。

它不会改变，也不会摧毁它。它不想停留在心中。这也是为什么在短期内你会看到人们表现出道德行为，但内心深处却有种种不好的迹象：无情、急躁、易怒、脾气暴躁，总是感到受伤，总是让别人感到受伤，自尊心总是受到伤害。看看，这下面就是破绽了。

即使在宽泛的道德准则之下，但总有一天，这种宽泛的道德也会露出马脚，对许多我们中的许多人来说都是如此。为什么那么多高层官员会做出最荒谬的事情而陷入丑闻，毁掉自己的整个职业生涯？这种事情每年都会发生好几次。你知道为什么吗？

因为他们是道德上坚定的人，对吧？他们服务人民，奉献自己于公共服务之中。而且很多时候，因为他们在公共服务中工作，收入远低于那些他们想与之一起读研究生的人。我们赚的钱是他们的十倍。

那么，在内心深处会发生什么呢？自我怜悯，自我怜悯。他们会说：“没有人知道我经历了什么。”然后机会来了——这里可以走个捷径，拿点钱，或者在这里出轨，而那个人会说：“我配得上。

” 这从哪里来？正是来自自我怜悯。来自自我中心。这一切都源于内心深处的空虚，尽管外面的人看起来如此高尚。

保罗说，这是绝对致命的。你没发现吗？你没有在自己身上看到这一点吗？你正在满足于一种会毁掉你的东西。

因此，我们看到了，即使这些看似重要的品质——比如亚里士多德所说的慷慨、正直、公正、节制——它们也可以出于内心的喜悦或空虚。为什么耶稣基督说：“你们的义若不胜过文士和法利赛人的义，断不能进天国。”他是在提醒我们看看那些文士和法利赛人。看看他们那种道德标准。

有一种道德标准是克制的，但你必须比这更深入才行。那么，我们如何做到呢？0.3. 从第4节到第7节，我们可以真正看到一个超自然改变的心是什么样的。你必须以力量和个体的方式来遇见爱。

现在，让我解释一下我的意思。实际上，在希腊文中比在英文中更加强烈地表达了这一点。但令人惊讶的是，从第4节到第7节的经文，并没有说：我希望你们有耐心。我希望你们仁慈。

我不希望你们嫉妒。我不希望你们自夸。我不希望你们骄傲。它并没有这样说。

相反，保罗将爱拟人化了。所有的动词都是及物动词。爱变成了一个个体、一个人。请注意，第4节直译是：爱是忍耐的。

这就是耐心。爱是不轻易发怒，在一切事上都不计较。爱是非常仁慈的。爱并不嫉妒。

而爱是一个在这样做的个体。他没有说“我希望你们怎么样”，而是给了我们一幅活跃的力量、一个个人力量的画面，它以一种特定的方式生活着。为什么他会这样做呢？首先，这是为了传达一个理念：真正的爱只有当你遇见了爱才会真正发展起来。

**真正的爱不是**通过努力实现的，而是通过接受和遇见来实现的。我的意思是说什么呢？如果他真的说：“现在，我希望你们做这十件事。”那将会是一套规则，我们本应去尝试去做。

但事实上，保罗在说：不，爱并不是首先你要做的事情。它是一个力量，它会把你拾起并改变你。我想让你知道的是，这听起来很神秘、超自然，但实际上并非如此。如果我们想想儿童的情况，社会科学家已经研究过这个问题了。

这是悲剧性的，总是会让你感动。但我们知道，如果一个婴儿出生后被放在一个从未被抱起、从未被拥抱、从未被爱、从未被轻声细语和微笑对待的环境中。最糟糕的是，如果你根本不爱这个孩子，当它长大时会发生什么？结果是，这个孩子会说：“我必须认为自己无法去爱了。

”基本上，这个孩子是破碎的，无法给予或接受爱。我们知道这一点。实际上，在很多情况下，他们甚至在成长之前就夭折了。为什么呢？

因为从根本上说，我们是通过被爱来学会如何去爱的。我们不只是尝试去做，而是通过被爱来学习如何去爱。我们受到的爱越多，我们就能更好地反映出爱。这一点我们都知道。

当我们从出生到成长的过程中，不断被爱所拥抱、包围和浸润，我们就越能去爱人。因为在你真正去努力爱之前，爱是你遇到的东西，是你要接受的东西。爱不是你需要去做的事情，而是一种力量将你托起并改变你。这是非常重要的。

因此，如果我们真的想培养这种爱，就必须经历一种超越性的爱。你看，如果我们知道自己有缺点，可能由于父母的爱，我们成长为一般意义上的正常人。但我们知道仍然有许多问题需要解决，这就意味着**我们需要比最好的父母所能给予的更高层次的爱。**我们必须遇到这种爱并接受它。

如果我们想要提升自我，被提升到另一个层面。首先，他将爱拟人化来传达爱是一种力量的概念，其次，他将爱拟人化让我们想到一个具体的人。你看，这不是诗。当他说到“爱是忍耐的”、“爱是慈爱的”，他在拟人化地描述爱的时候，并不是在写诗。

这并不是诗。我告诉你为什么。如果四至七节只是抽象的一个模型、一个完美爱人形象的画像，如果这就是全部，如果保罗说他希望你们去思考一个极其有耐心、无比仁慈的人，从不自夸、从不自私、从不记仇。如果他只是在给我展示一个完美的爱人的例子，那我不要它，你也不要。

因为你会想：哇，我能成为那样的人吗？不，你会想：哇，我永远做不到那样。如果你对自己的内心有所了解，四至七节只是给出一个完美爱人的一般画像，这会让你感到沮丧。我不想要它，让我们把它撕掉。

但我认为保罗不是这样做的。保罗用爱来比喻，然后想象自己没有特别指一个人，这就完全不了解保罗了。现在我想让你考虑一下：当保罗写下“爱是忍耐”时，他怎能不想到那位说“我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我”的人呢？那种痛苦是无穷无尽的。

而说到出于爱，和说爱不做亏欠的事，他又怎能不想到那位说“父啊，赦免他们”的人？他们不知道自己在做什么。他们在杀他，他们在杀他。保罗说：“父啊，赦免他们。

”他们不知道自己在做什么。当他讲到“爱总是保护”、“总是盼望”，他又怎能不想到那位说“今日你要与我同在乐园中”的人呢？即使他在被杀，即使他在死去，他仍然能够转向一个十字架上的强盗，说：“我要和你一同在乐园里。”当你看到希望时，当你看到爱是恒久忍耐的，爱就是恒久忍耐。

耶稣在十字架上最令人惊讶的话之一就是“成了”。你知道这个词是什么意思吗？那就是希腊文中的“完成”、“成就”。他临死前说：“成了。

”你知道**这意味着什么吗？这里有一个赤身裸体的人。**这里是一个被遗弃的人。这里是一个一无所有的穷人。

这里是一个受折磨的人。这里是一个没有力量的人。这里是一个所有人都抛弃了的人。就在他快要死去的时候，他说：“我做到了。

”他做到了什么？他完成了我们的救赎，因为他代替我们死在十字架上，承担了我们的刑罚——换句话说，他拒绝死亡直到完成他来做的事。爱是恒久忍耐的。顺便说一句，爱永不失败。

那么，有人能写下这些话，尤其是圣保罗，而不想到：即使我对我妻子、孩子有多么深的爱情，总有一天我会死去。你还能对谁说他的爱永不失败呢？只有耶稣基督说过：“我决不离弃你。”这是在希伯来书中写的。

于是我们有了那首伟大的圣诗：“灵魂啊，地狱尽全力也想摇动你，我绝不会，绝不，绝不离弃你。”你知道这是为什么吗？我们知道这是因为耶稣基督为我们承受了地狱的痛苦，连地狱也无法将他从为我们做他愿意做的事中推开。他做到了。

现在，让我们来看一下四到七节的内容。你可以把这几节看作是一个完美爱你的人的抽象形象，但这永远不会改变你的心。它只会让你在罪疚感下感到压抑。你会想：“我必须努力才能做到这样。

” 或者你可以看到耶稣基督是这一切的终极榜样，在十字架上为你做这一切。他不是为了做一个榜样才这样做，而是作为你的救主为你做了这一切。当你看到这一点时，会发生什么？你相信吗？

你接受吗？你是否每天都在思考、品味它呢？这将会发生什么呢。它会一天天地消除你的恐惧。

它会消除你的恐惧。你不再害怕丢脸，谁在乎呢？你不再害怕失去任何东西。一方面，它会因他爱你而让你摆脱恐惧；另一方面，它会让你因他的爱而不顾一切而感到谦卑。

所以如果你把爱看作是抽象的，并试图达到那个标准，要么你会因为觉得自己做到了而充满骄傲，要么你会因为知道自己做不到而感到恐惧。但如果你看到耶稣基督为你做了这一切，这会消除你的恐惧和骄傲，开始从内心再生你的心。因此，如果你看到耶稣基督在四到七节中为你所做的爱，最终这种爱会在你心中再现。让我们获得一个超自然改变的心吧。

现在就开始吧。让我们祷告。天父，我们感谢你，这段经文远非我们所想的那样。当然，它表面上看起来就是如此。

这是一份关于拥有爱心关系的美好清单。这是一份婚姻或任何关系，甚至是所有关系的绝佳蓝图。然而，它远不止于此。它向我们展示了我们必须遇见你的儿子耶稣基督在十字架上的道理。

忍受苦难的最高典范，记念恶事的最高典范，爱永不退缩且永不失败的最高典范。这不可能失败。现在，在基督耶稣里，那些在祂里面的人没有定罪。主啊，求你使我们在那为我们所展现的大爱中被融化、受感动，让我们的恐惧和骄傲随着时间消逝。

我们愿意承认到一个程度上，福音对我们影响不大。十字架和耶稣所做的事。我们现在就渴望发展出超自然改变的心。现在与我们同在吧。

我们以耶稣的名祷告。阿门。感谢您收听《福音与生活播客》。希望今天的教导能激励你更深入地研读神的话语。
