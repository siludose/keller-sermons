# The Search for God / The Search for God

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel and Life. Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really last? Is this all there is?

In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears, and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ. You can read from that with me. I'm going to read in Exodus chapter 1, you have verses 1 to 11.

I'm going to read all the way down to 14. So when you get to the bottom of the page, just wait another eight seconds and it'll be over. Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 to 14.

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that through the bush, that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up.

So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why the bush does not burn up. When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, Moses, Moses. And Moses said, here I am.

What else do you say? Anyway, I've always wondered, do not come any closer, God said, take off your sandals for the place where you were standing as holy ground. Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God. The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I've heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.

So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hidites, Amrites, Parasites, Hivites, and Jebiusites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.

But Moses said to God, who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt? And God said, I will be with you, and this will be the sign to you, that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.

And Moses said to God, suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, look, God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is his name? What shall I tell them? God said, I am who I am.

This is what you were to say to the Israelites. I am, has sent me to you. This is God's word.

In the beginning here of the fall, we've been giving some concepts and some guidelines for people who are searching spiritually, and it's really, well, not everywhere, but it's certainly a plain fact that it's actually acceptable, even in a secular urban place like New York City. It's now acceptable to say, I am a spiritual searcher. I am spiritually searching.

If you go to Barnes and Noble and you look at all the new nonfiction books, which I did recently, there was something like 25% of the first shelf that I saw that had something to do with God, something to do with spirituality, something to do with soul, something to do. Here are some of the titles. Here are two of my favorite titles.

One is called Cyber Grace, searching for God in a digital age, searching for God. Okay, here's another one, not as funny, but same thing. Besides still waters, and the subtitle was searching for meaning in an age of doubt.

Now, as I read these, or surveyed them, of course in Barnes and Noble, you know, you can sit down and just read them and just stay there. But as I was surveying and reading them, I noticed something, and I noticed that the writers of these books are tremendously conflicted, that's the right word. And here's where the conflict is.

Though 10 years ago, even certainly 20 years ago, if you are a modern, sophisticated, secular, urban type person here in New York, it would not have been acceptable. It would not have been respectable to say, I'm a spiritual searcher. Today, it is very respectable.

It's very almost noble. It's insightful. It's wise to say, I'm a spiritual searcher, but I've noticed when I read the book, that it is not acceptable.

It's acceptable to say, I'm searching, but it's not acceptable to say, I've found anything. It's one thing to say, I'm searching for God. None of these books would be up on the shelf if they said, finding God in an age of doubt, finding God in a digital age.

That's what they're not talking about that. And what's intriguing is, they're all in this kind of bind. It is a bind.

They are searching with a tremendous sphere of finding. Not a terrible situation to be in. It would think it has to be far more comfortable to either search, either not search or define, but not to search, not wanting to find.

And the reason for this, I've been thinking about this, I'm looking at this thing and I'm seeing what they say, and they feel they say, well, I'm a spiritual searcher, but I'm not one of those people that say, I've found God. I'm not one of those people that believe you can have certainty anymore. Now, here's my belief on that.

Here's my understanding for what I can tell, and sometimes it comes right out in the books. Most spiritual searchers have been involved in religious institutions. They were many of them were raised in churches or synagogues or something else.

They have some kind of religious background. And they found that inside religious institutions, religious people are more angry, more insecure, more judgmental, more hypocritical. There's more fighting.

There's more pride and prejudice going on inside religious institutions than outside. And religious people say, I found God. And we don't want to be like them.

Now, I want to put it on the record right here that I agree that by and large, inside religious organizations, religious societies and religious bodies, there is more insecurity, anger. There is more fighting. There is more brutality.

There is more abuse. There is more hypocrisy than outside. I will just come out and say, yes.

And therefore, it's perfectly understandable why people say, I'm searching. See, there's stuck between the smugness of the religious people they don't want. And their own deep spiritual emptiness.

They're stuck. Is there a way out? Yeah, I think there's a way out.

The way out is this. First of all, you have to recognize a fallacy. And the fallacy is this.

Let me put to you this way. Imagine John Doe. He's always getting drunk.

Why? Well, on Monday night, he got drunk on gin and soda water. On Tuesday night, he got drunk on vodka and soda water.

On Wednesday night, he got drunk on bourbon and soda water. What is it that's making him drunk? Obviously, the common factor, soda water.

That must be what's making him drunk. Right? No.

Of course not. And yet, here's a narrow person and they think they found God. Here's a narrow person.

They think they found God. Here's a narrow person. Association is not causation.

And for a person who's very narrow and condemning to say, I found God, doesn't mean at all that the judgmental attitude is caused by the conviction of finding God. And yet, that's the assumption. It could be that you see there's something else causing it.

There's something else besides religious certainty that they found God. There might be some other cause. And if that's true, and you get over that fallacy, you can finally go to the book, which is five far, the most likely book, to tell you something about God.

And that's the Bible. In fact, if you go to the Old Testament where you have Judaism and Islam and Christianity, you put those three together and you have three quarters of the human race or something like that in terms of the people's tradition. If you take a look at all that, you see, they all take a look at the Old Testament and they all say, this is sacred.

The only intelligent way to find out how do I find God is to go to the Bible first at least. And when you go to the Bible, you'll see the Bible says you can find God, not just search for God, but find God. And this particular passage that I read where Moses finds God is really very, very important because it really gives you all the basic principles.

There's three things that we see here, not exactly three things. There's actually the same thing looked at more and more deeply. There's burning bush.

At first, it's a distracting, disrupting site. At first, all it is to Moses is a disrupting site. When it gets closer, he sees it's an unmanageable power.

And when it gets even closer, he sees there's a burning angel in the middle. And I would like to say to you, as you see each of these three, you are going to pass through the stages through which you have to go to find God. You have to see the same three things.

You have to know and experience the same three things. What are they? I'll summarize at the end.

Phenomenally, that means when I'm looking at it from the outside, first of all, we look at it and it's just a disrupting site. It takes him out of his normal course of action. Then he goes in closer and he sees it's an unmanageable power.

And then last of all, he sees there's a burning angel in the middle of it. Until you see all three things, until the same three things happen to you, you can't find God. Now, let's take a look at the three things.

Each one is a stage. First, first of all, the burning bush is a disrupting event. Now, what I mean by disrupting, notice it says here in verse three and four, says Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up.

So he said, I will go over and see it. And verse four says the Lord saw that he had gone over to look. And then he spoke.

Now, the word gone over is not a very good translation. This is one of the places where our translation, I think, fails us. Because we have a very specific word here that's used twice.

And the much better translation would be turn aside. It's a word that's used in Hebrew to mean go off the beaten path, go off the normal path, go off the main road. Moses was just, what was he doing?

He was just moving his flock around. He was doing his thing. He was an ordinary life.

And unless something came to disrupt ordinary life, he would never have started to search for God. You know, Moses doesn't say, I think I'll search for God today. Something has to disrupt him and turn him aside from the normal path because the Bible tells us, ordinary life makes you too busy and this inclines you to search for God.

What do I mean? Well, you know, see us Lewis in his book on the screw tape letters. It's a lot of fun.

It's a fun thing to read if you've never read it. It's a quick read. And it's a fiction book, I hope.

And it's about a senior devil writing letters to his nephew, a junior devil, who's still out on the tempting field. A senior devil's name, screw tape. Screw tape is a retirement, sort of at least he's up higher in the bureaucracy now of hell.

And, you know, he's giving advice to his nephew. And he starts to tell his nephew one of the best ways to make sure that your patient, he calls him, never falls into the clutches of the enemy, which of course is Jesus. And here's what he says, he says, the trouble about argument is that it moves the whole struggle onto the enemy's ground.

By the very act of arguing, you awake the patient's reason. And once it's awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular strain of thought can be twisted to end in our favor, you will find that you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues.

And with drawing attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences, your business is to fix his attention on that stream. Teach him to call it real life. And don't let him ask what he means by real.

Remember, he's not like you. He's not a pure spirit. You don't realize how enslaved these humans are to the pressure of the ordinary.

I once had a patient, a sound atheist who used to read in the British Museum one day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his mind beginning to go the wrong way. The enemy, of course, was at his elbow. Before I knew where I was, I saw my 20 years of great, hard work beginning to totter.

If I had lost my head and begun to attempt a defense by argument, I should have been undone. But I was not such a fool. I immediately suggested it was just about time he has some lunch.

The enemy presumably made the counter suggestion, you know how one can never quite over hear what he says to them, that this was more important than lunch. At least I think that must have been his line for when I said quite. In fact, it's much too important to tackle at the end of the morning.

The patient brightened up considerably and by the time I had added much better, come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind, he was already halfway to the door. Once he was in the street, the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting the midday paper.

I showed him a number 73 bus going past as usual. And before he reached the bottom of the steps, I had gotten into him the unalterable conviction that whatever odd ideas may come up into a man's head when he's a shut up alone with his books. A healthy dose of real life by which he meant the bus and the newsboy I imagine was enough to show him that all that sort of thing just couldn't be true.

He knew he'd had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about that inarticulate sense of actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of mirror logic. He is now safe in our father's house below. We're never going to search for God as long as we're in ordinary life.

We're just busy. We're just carried along. Sense experience keeps us from asking the question, why am I so busy?

What am I doing? What is it accomplishing? What's the purpose of it all?

What is my life accomplishing? What is it all amounting to? We never asked that question.

We're too busy in ordinary life. Something has to turn us aside. We'll never do it on our own.

Something has to come and turn us aside or we're stuck. And what is that thing that has to turn us aside? It's got to be a burning bush.

He turned aside and to see the strange sight. Now, what is a burning bush? The burning bush is something that contradicts the model or view of reality that you've got.

A burning bush is something that is actually a paradigm bomb. It comes inside your paradigm of what things should be like and it explodes it. Now I'll tell you how a burning bush works.

The burning bush works like this. If such and such is true, which I think it is, then such things couldn't happen. But there's one of those things.

Therefore such and such can't be true. Got that? See, I believe such and such.

And if such and such, then this can't be, this can never happen. But this just happened. Therefore such and such can't be true.

That's a burning bush. See, in this case, if you're empiricist, if you're somebody who says, well, I just believe in what's here and now, I believe that everything is a natural cause. I don't believe in the supernatural.

I don't believe in mystical things. I just believe everything is a natural cause. Oh, what's a burning bush?

It's a contradiction. Because a bush is either burning and it's disintegrating or it's cold and it's intact, but this is a bush that burns and is not consumed. And that means that there's something more to life and reality.

If you don't have a supernatural view of reality, the burning bush is a paradigm bomb. If this world is all there is, then burning bushes can't happen. A burning bush has happened.

Therefore, there must be something more to my view. But my review of reality has to change. Now, a burning bush is the only thing that ever gets us out of ordinary life and makes us turn aside and think about it and concentrate on it and ask the big questions.

See, now what form is going to burning bush come in? Oh, my many, many forms, many forms. Let me give you four quick ones, but they're very important.

I mean, this is one of the main things that this tells us. You'll never find God just by abstractly one day saying, I think it's about time I'm 35. I should go find God.

That'll never happen. You're stuck in the stream of ordinary life. Something's got to turn you aside and these are the things that turn you aside.

Let me give you a quick example. Four, one is an inexplicable person can be a burning bush. One of my favorite illustrations on this is a woman who this actually is in a book somewhere I have to go find it, but there's a woman who told how she'd come to Redeemer back in the early days when Redeemer was rather small.

She was someone who never thought much about religion was an interested in religion, but she worked for a TV network in town and she had a boss. And one day, she screwed up and if she could have easily lost her job, but the boss took the blame for her fallout. He was able to keep his job with that kind of thing, but she probably would not have been able to keep it.

And she was amazed. She said she had a number of bosses who would shift the blame to her. But she'd never had a boss who took the blame from her.

And she was just astounded. And so she went and she thanked him, but then she kept pushing it. You know, why would you do that?

And that was awfully nice. Why would you do that? He tried to put her off a little bit and say, well, thank you.

And no, no, it's just something anybody would do. And finally, he says, all right, I'm a Christian. And she said, what's that got to do with it?

And she says, well, you know, he says, well, you see in other religions, you know, God does this and that, but in our religion, our God actually came and took the blame. My Savior took the blame for me and therefore I can take the blame for other people. Now this was a paradigm bomb because in her mind, religion made people blamers.

That's the only kind of person she'd ever see that got religious blamers. You never thought of a religion that could turn you into a taker of blame. You never saw that.

And suddenly she says, maybe this religion is different. Maybe this person is different. She says, where do you go to church?

And it was redeemer and she started coming. So she had a model and it blew it up. Let me give you another example.

Another kind of burning bush is not an explicable person, but an inexplicable train of thought. Now what I mean by that is a lot of secular people are starting to become spiritual searchers because they're starting to think out the implications of what it means to be a secular person to believe that there's really no eternity. There's no supernatural.

There's no heaven. Everything is just an accident. Everything is just a matter.

Everything is matter and motion. Everything is chemistry and biology and physics. That's it.

And a lot of people are beginning to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, Jack Miles in his lead article in the 97 December New York Times magazine, whole issue on spiritual searching. That's the one. The title of it was, religion makes a comeback, belief to follow.

And you see, the title of that shows exactly what I said in the beginning. People are searching. But they're searching for belief.

They're searching and they're hungry, but we're not really ready to find yet. But this is what he says. This is terrific.

He says, can a postmodern path be open for thinking people to religion that they can practice? If the answer is yes, he's careful. I suspect the first step on the path will be the religious reflection on the secular loss of faith.

The secular loss of faith. Now listen to this. He says, a man or woman who turns to religion may not do so to acknowledge the mystery of God or religion, but to acknowledge the mystery in response to which their religion has come into being.

Namely, the felt necessity, mysterious in itself, to live a moral life even when the grounds of morality cannot be known. Now, I mean it's a little hard. Unless you've read the whole paragraph in the column, here's what he's saying.

He says, we are secular people, and therefore there shouldn't be such a thing as morality. There shouldn't, there's no moral absolutes. I mean, it's all a matter of opinion.

There's not such thing as beauty. It's all a matter of chemistry. There's no way to say that human beings are more valuable than rocks or trees or salamanders because we're just accidents.

But he says, if my worldview that this life is all there is is true, then there can't be such a thing as human value. There can't be such a thing as beauty. There can't be such a thing as real injustice, but there is.

And I'm seeing that I have to live a moral life even though my secular worldview gives me no basis for it. Now, you see what's going on? If you're willing to think, see, this guy is completely out of screw tapes control.

This guy is thinking this guy is not looking at the 73 bus. He's starting to think he says, wait a minute, if secularism is true, then there can't be injustice. There can't be real love.

There can't be beauty. People really aren't valuable, but they are. And that means that everything almost he's looking at is becoming a burning bush.

And he's going back and saying, if my premises lead me to a conclusion I know is not true, then I have to go back and check the premises. Maybe there is a god. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book, The Prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The Prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The Prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. So an inexplicable train of thought can be a burning bush.

Thirdly, an inexplicable trouble. Now, what I mean by that, troubles are our burning bushes. Oh, my.

And here's why. And this is especially no offense is especially relevant for a crowd that's with so many young people in it because you're especially in a place like New York. And who comes to New York?

Young people come to New York. You're the people that work out. You're the people with good grades.

You're the people who have really got your ducks in a row. You're the people who have come here and you say, I'm going to work out and I'm going to work real hard. And I've got this plan.

I've got that plan. And I can master life. You know, come on world.

I'm ready. And you've got a little paradigm. And the paradigm is if I really, really work hard.

If I'm really wise, I'm really careful. If I'm really savvy, I will be able to handle life. Life is manageable.

Oh, no, it's not. And when some, you know, you see yourself as big and life is little and all of a sudden, the troubles hit you. And you suddenly think, see yourself as some little teeny thing beside the huge mountain of reality.

And you begin to realize that the trouble is a burning bush that is smashing your little model of reality, namely that you're competent to run your own life. That you're wise enough and strong enough to be able to just handle normal life. Most of us think that way until a little, until a trouble comes.

You can't do it by yourself. You can't be your own Savior. You can't be your own Lord.

Here's the last one. Burning bush can be an inexplicable person, can be an inexplicable train of thought, can be an inexplicable trouble, but it also can be an inexplicable emptiness. Now, actually, if you were here last week, we talked about this.

We had an open forum and we talked about success. And I made a reference to one of my favorite quotes as a column by Cynthia Heimel in the Village Voice some years ago in which she talked about the fact that she knew an awful lot of people who had been not famous and they became famous. She knew a lot of movie stars before they became famous.

And she found out after they became famous, they got to be extremely angry, extremely upset, extremely manic, extremely depressed. And here's a part of her article I didn't read last week. She says, I believe that when God wants to play a really rotten joke on you, he grants you your deepest wish and then giggles mirrorly as you suddenly realize you want to kill yourself.

Now, you know why she says that? She says that everybody she knows, who's ever gotten their fondest dreams and there's not that many. People who've dreamt of fame, they get it, dreamt of wealth, they get it, dreamt of some kind of success, they get it.

She says, the few people she knows go berserk because they think that that is what surely is going to fulfill the minute it didn't. That's surely what's going to make them feel good about themselves and it doesn't. That's surely what's going to really make life great now and it hasn't.

And as a result, they suddenly realize, oh my gosh, there is a vacuum in me huge and their paradigm and that is that this is salvation. This is what life's about, completely is destroyed. Success and the emptiness that always comes with success is the maybe the most powerful of all of the burning bushes.

You see? But you have to have one or you'll never find God. They've got to come in and notice they're almost all in pleasant, unless your boss takes, you know, saves your job.

That's the best kind. But they tend to be very unpleasant. They tend to be foolish, stormy and strong.

They really are very, very hard. And so listen, when they come, here's what I suggest. Those of you who are searching, it could be that this has happened to you.

It could be that you're in the very beginning. Something like this has come into your life and you've turned aside. Good.

Would you please turn aside? What does it mean to turn aside? If what if Moses had looked at his watch and said, I got to get the flock home by eight o'clock?

You never would have heard of Moses. He never would have met God. Why?

Because he was in ordinary life. He was just in the stream. You have to turn aside.

You have to spend time. You have to read. You have to think you have to become vulnerable to a degree because you've got to talk to somebody about these things.

And boy, who knows, you know, what that will lead to? You've got to turn aside. You've got to give it time.

You've got to. You've got to make room. Oh, do.

Now, Christians, if you say, well, this isn't about me, is it? Of course it is. And here's why.

I know you're not going to want to hear this, but here's what here it is. The way to find more of God is always happens on the same principles on the same principles on which you find God. In other words, the same principles for finding more of God are the principles on which you find God, which means if you're just sort of moving along in the ordinary stream of life as a Christian, you're never going to get deeper unless something comes in and smashes the little paradigms.

And the reason why we are not growing, the reason we are not more like Christ is not simply that we need to try harder. Always the reason why we're not more like Christ is because our understanding of the gospel or understanding of Jesus or understanding of what the Bible teaches about God is faulty. We read it.

We think we understand it. Oh, in other words, the average Christian says, Jesus is my meaning in life. I am a Christian.

I'm born again. I'm a Christian. Jesus is my meaning in life.

And then along comes some kind of career failure. And you're ready to slit your throat. And what does that mean?

You thought Jesus was your meaning in life. You thought Jesus was your righteousness, that Jesus was your honor and your glory. You thought that you were saved by what Jesus has done, not by what you're doing.

And then along comes this little paradigm. I'm in blows it up and it's just not in the case at all. You thought you were depending on God and then come along, along comes some kind of burning bush.

Or you thought you understood God and then suddenly something happens. You say, God should never let such a thing happen. Well, in your view of God that could never, nothing like that should ever happen, but it happened.

It's happened there. It is the burning bush. You see?

And because it's there, that means your view of God is wrong. Don't get mad at God. Realize it's your view of God.

It's your model of reality. There is no way to find more of God without doing it the same way you found God to start with. Secondly, after he turns aside and he comes on in, he realizes that God has something to say to him.

Now a lot of people turn aside and they start to come in, but they don't hear this. And here's the best way to put this. It's a little contradiction, a little contradiction that always gets you into a search mode.

It's these contradictions of persons or troubles or intellectual trains of thought and so on, but the way you know you're right at the threshold of actually finding God is when you come to see the big contradiction. Little contradictions lead you to a big contradiction. And here's the big contradiction.

Unless you've felt this, unless you've wrestled with this, unless this is born down on you, you're not going to meet the real God. And the big contradiction is this. He speaks to Moses and this is what he says.

Moses, Moses, do not come any closer. Now that is an incredible contradiction. Why?

I'll tell you why. On the one hand and then on the other hand, first of all, Moses, Moses. Now in English, this doesn't seem to work because we say Moses, Moses, okay, what does that mean?

In Hebrew, the doubling of a word means magnitude. In the Old Testament, there's many places where in your translations, you're reading the Old Testament in English and it'll say things like great pits. They fell into the great pits.

That's not like in Genesis 18 or something. They fell into great pits. But if you're actually reading in Hebrew, it'll say the pit pits because in Hebrew, the way to say big pits is to say pit pits, okay?

And when you double a proper name, like when David doesn't just say Absalom, but it says Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son, when Jesus says Simon, Simon, Satan wanted to have you and sift you like wheat when Jesus says Martha The doubling of a name means emotional intensity, magnitude of relationship. Now it always means I want to have a relationship with you. It always means love.

It always means intensity. Now are you starting to figure this out? When Moses walks up, God says I want you closer.

Go away. Moses, Moses, don't come any closer. Now wait a minute.

Do you see? He's saying come closer. Stop.

Take off your shoes. This is holy ground. What's going on here?

On the one hand, he's being told I am a holy God. That's the reason why the God is a God of fire. Fire means holiness.

Fire means justice. Fire means majesty. Fire means I am what I am.

Not what you want me to be. When Moses said what is your name? God did not say my name is I am what you want.

No. What God said the Moses is I am what I am. You see, if his name was I am what I want, it wouldn't have been a fiery, but it would have been clay.

You can do what do you want with him? People are constantly doing this. They start right out saying this.

They say well I just am looking for God. You got your faith and that's good for you and it helps you. That's fine for you.

And it's true for you. But if I can find a faith, I need a faith. It's true for me.

And so when they ask me, well I'm interested in being a Christian, you shall say now to Christians believe this, I mean if I become a Christian, well I have to do this and this, I don't want to have to do this and I don't have to do this. Now you know what's going on? That's a clay God.

That's not a fiery God. What you're looking for is a God that fits you instead of a God that you fit. You see in clay, it's molded by the toucher, but fire melts the touchy.

I mean the toucher comes in and touches clay and of course the clay gives to the toucher. But fire, if you touch the fire, turns you to clay. And what God is saying right off the bat is, if you want the real God, you've got to look for a God that can contradict you.

If you want the real God, you've got to look for a God. You have to be willing to see a God who's going to tell you things you don't want to hear. When somebody says, let me go right out.

When somebody says, you know, I've got a girlfriend, I've got a boyfriend. I don't want to be a Christian if it means getting in the way of that. Now here's what you're saying.

It's an utter contradiction. You're in the stream of life, so you're not being logical. So let me get you out.

What you're saying is, I know who I am before I even know who he is. I haven't even met God, but I know what I need. I haven't met God, but I know what sex ethics are.

I haven't even met God, but I know what my needs are. How could you know who you are before you even met him if he's the creator? If there is a creator, if he's done all this, which means you can't even begin to search for this God, a real God without taking your shoes off.

You see, God doesn't say, I want to meet you, and then you can take your shoes off. He says, you're not even going to meet me until you take your shoes off first. And what that means, you have got to say, God, if you're there, I am willing to do things that right now I don't like.

And if you're not willing to say that, and most most modern people are not, then what you've actually done is you're saying, I'm looking for God, but you're not looking for God, you're not looking for a real God, reality is not what you want it to be. Don't you know that by now? Reality is always itself.

You can't really change. I mean, you're, you know, all right, guy, you're 125 pounds, and you're five foot six, and you're working out, you're never going to play professional football. I don't care.

Never. You can do everything you want. You're just not going to be able to do it.

You probably won't even be able to be a kicker. But certainly not going to be the lineback you've always dreamt to be. Reality is there.

And if there is, I mean, if somebody comes to you and says, I want to get to know you, you say, fine. So well, I like to think of you as a demanding, domineering person. You say, how dare you?

You don't even really want to know who I am. You've, you can't get to know me by just saying, I want to think, but now look what you've done. When a person says, I don't want to find a God who won't let me do this or that.

I don't want to be narrow person. And what you're really saying is, I refuse to give to God the same deference I demand from anybody else who wants to get to know me. See, unless you take your shoes off from the beginning, that means unless you're willing to find a God who tells you things you don't want to hear and demands things that you don't want to do, you haven't even begun to search.

You can't start the search objectively. And then hope that somehow we'll find a God. You've got to start up by saying, God, if you're there, I'm willing to agree that you may be holy.

You may be fire. Now I said that and you say, wait a minute, if that's the case, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, I don't want to God like that. But now the same God who says, stay back.

I'm holy. Don't just walk into me. Don't just be casual with the spirit of curiosity.

You see, show some deference, show some respect. Be willing to surrender to even find me. But then he's also the guy who says, Moses, Moses, you know, or your name here, whatever your name is.

He says, I want you in. I want to be part of you. I want to come close.

In fact, the very statement, Moses, Moses, stay away is a burning bush. It's an utter contradiction. What God is saying is, I want to have my holiness in you.

But how can God's holiness come in me? How can this great and majestic thing come down into me? You see what God is, you see what the burning bush is?

The burning bush is the contradiction at the heart of biblical religion. And that is the true God insists that he is not really holy and maybe a little loving or not really loving and maybe a little holy, but he's absolutely holy and he's absolutely loving. He is a burning bush.

He is another contradiction. And everybody else in the world refuses to listen to who he is. Religious people say he's really holy and we can get to heaven by trying our best and doing good.

In other words, you know, they emphasize the holiness and not the grace. And that's the reason why we don't like them. And that's the reason why basically they don't have a God that they really enjoy, but a God of drudgery.

And they don't even have a God they can really get passionate for because they have a God that you can control. You have a tame God. If you think you can earn your way to heaven, that's not a fiery God.

That's a very tame God. You bought him off. But on the other hand, the other people don't look at the holiness.

They look at the love. Modern people love the idea of a God who just accepts us, you know, Mr. Rogers God, right?

I love you just the way you are. And I just love and accept you. And that also is not a fiery God.

That is a sentimental God. And you're not going to get you don't get passionate about that. A person who says God is holy and he occasionally forgives.

You're not filled with joy to God like that. Or God says, yes, he accepts me just the way I am. And there's no cost in of his love.

And you're not accept. There is no fire unless he's both equally. Do you see the contradiction?

If you insist on going truth or love and not keeping them together, if you insist on saying, I believe in a God who's really basically demanding God, or I believe in a God who's a completely loving, accepting God of everybody, if you go either way, you'll never see the true God because the true God is a fiery God who says, I want a relationship of love with you. This is the reason why Jesus says we pipe the flute for you and you would not dance and we sang a dirge for you and you would not mourn. Christianity is far more optimistic and pessimistic.

Far higher and lower. God says, I am the holy God, but I come down, see, verse 8, in mercy. Christianity is far more demanding in what God does than any other religion and far more loving and far more gracious in what God does than any other religion.

No other religion has a God that holy who says, be perfect or you won't get the heaven. God says that in the Bible. No other religion says that, but on the other hand, no other religion has a God who comes down.

And that's the solution. The little contradictions will bring you to God. The big contradiction will be in front of you.

Don't leave that. Don't ever compromise. Don't ever move away from what it says.

But what's the solution? How can that holiness come into my life? And the answer is, in the midst of the burning bush, there's an angel.

Not an angel. I'm sorry, did I say an angel? Very important in the Old Testament.

Whenever you reach, whenever you see an angel and anybody tries to worship an angel, the angel always says, get up. I'm a creature just like yourself. But in the Old Testament, there's a very mysterious figure who's called the angel of the Lord.

Verse 2, there the angel of the Lord appeared to him and flames the fire. Now, how is it possible that this contradiction can be brought together? And the answer is, the Lord spoke through the angel.

There was a mediator in the bush. The angel was in the bush and yet the Lord spoke through the bush. What?

Through the mediator. There was this figure, this mysterious figure. But this mediator was in the midst of the fire.

Why? We know the answer. All through the Old Testament, God says, the way you can live with a holy God and have a personal relationship with me is if someone substitutes and takes your punishment.

And so over and over and over again, sacrifices were made into the fire of God's holiness. When you were guilty, you made a sacrifice and you asked for forgiveness. And it was a substitute.

Something was slain and put into the fire. But the New Testament tells us why. Because there was one who went in and by one sacrifice through himself into the fire, he was consumed so that we will not have to be consumed.

And because Jesus Christ was consumed by the holy wrath of God, we are able to become burning bushes ourselves. Do you know what a burning bush is? A burning bush is someone with the holiness of God in us, but it doesn't destroy us.

You know what that means? A Christian is someone filled with power, personality, and dwelling personality. Secondly, a Christian is someone with beauty.

In fact, there is no better picture of what Martin Luther called the card of the gospel, symbol used to set peccator. Simultaneously, when you become a Christian, because Jesus Christ is not for you, you are simultaneously just and sinful. Simultaneously, you're beautiful but a bush.

You know, not a giant redwood sequoia. You know, when you become a Christian, you don't become a sequoia. You become a burning bush.

You're still a bush. You're still a sinner. And yet, you're clothed with the righteousness of Jesus.

You're filled with the beauty of Jesus. You know, that is what's possible. And it will only be possible.

And you will only turn into a passionate, burning heart person. If you see not just the God of truth, or just the God of love, but to see the law by Christful filled, and here is pardoning voice, transforms a slave into a child and duty into choice. Do you understand?

Let the little contradictions drive you to the big contradiction. And then stay with that. If this is the first time you've heard of it tonight, I can tell you this.

You probably don't get it yet. I wasn't that clear. There wasn't enough time, but I tell you please turn aside.

And Christian friends, realize this. If you need to get your bush burning again, go back and see what Jesus did. Go back and see him consumed in the fire.

Go back and see that because he was burned and consumed, we can burn and not be consumed with the holy power of God. To the degree you see that. You see, to the degree you see him burning in the bush, you'll become a bush that burns and is not consumed.

Let's pray. We ask Father that you'd help us to apply these things. A lot of us are actually suffering right now and we're just grumpy about it.

We're just mad about it. Instead of seeing that this is your way of turning us aside with contradictions and bringing us into the heart of the great contradiction, which is that the law was fulfilled by your love in Jesus Christ. We ask that you would change your hearts with these things and apply them to our lives through Jesus and his name we pray.

Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life and share it with others.

欢迎来到《福音与生命》。你有没有问过自己，我所做的一切真的有意义吗？这真的是全部了吗？今天，提姆·基勒（Tim Keller）将带我们看看《传道书》如何帮助我们面对疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并引导我们找到在基督里的持久希望和意义。

你可以跟我一起读。我要从出埃及记第一章读到第十一节。我会一直读到第十四节。所以当你看到页面底部时，再等八秒钟就结束了。

出埃及记第三章一至十四节。摩西管理着米甸祭司叶忒罗的羊群。他把羊群带到旷野的一个地方，在那里到了何烈山（即西奈山）。耶和华的使者在荆棘丛中显现给他，荆棘丛被火包围，却没有烧毁。

摩西看见了，就去观看这奇异的事，为什么荆棘不被烧毁呢。当神见他过去要看时，神从荆棘中呼叫说：“摩西！摩西！”摩西就说：“我在这里。

” 还有什么可说的？神说：“不要靠近；脱下鞋来，因为你站的地方是圣地。”又说：“我是你父亲的神，是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。”摩西蒙上脸，因为怕看神。

耶和华说：“我看见以色列人所受的苦，听见他们在埃及人的手下悲叹的声音。我也知道他们的痛苦。所以我下来是要拯救他们脱离埃及人的手，并要把他们从那里领出来，在那流奶与蜜之地，就是我向他们列祖起誓应许给他们的地方。” 现在，以色列人的呼求已经达到了我这里；我看见埃及人怎样苦待他们。

所以现在去吧！我要差遣你到法老面前，使我的百姓以色列人从埃及出来。但摩西对神说：“我是什么人，竟能去见法老，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？” 神回答说：“我必与你同在。

你要将百姓从埃及领出来，在这山上事奉我。” 摩西又对神说：“假若我去到以色列人那里，对他们说：‘这是你们的神所差遣的’，他们问我说：‘他叫什么名字？’我要对他们说什么？” 神回答说：“我是那‘我必是’的；这是我的名，直到永远；这是我夸耀的记号。

” 在这一段关于灵性探索的开始中，我们已经提供了一些概念和指导方针给那些正在寻求精神上的人。确实，在一个像纽约这样的世俗城市里，并不是到处都有，但毫无疑问这是一个明显的事实：现在说“我是一个灵性探索者”是被接受的。在巴诺书店的新非小说类书籍中，最近我看到第一层书架上有大约25%的内容与神、灵性或灵魂有关。如果你去巴诺书店看看，你会发现第一层书架上有很多这样的书籍。

这里有一些书名。这是我最喜欢的一些书名之一： 一本叫《网络中的恩典》，在数字时代寻找上帝；另一本是《静水深流》（原题：Besides Still Waters），副标题是“在怀疑的时代寻找意义”。当我阅读这些书或浏览它们时，当然，在巴诺书店你可以坐下来看，但当我浏览和阅读它们时，我注意到一些事情。我发现这些书籍的作者们非常矛盾，这就是他们的冲突所在。

10年前甚至20年前，如果你是一个现代、有文化的、世俗的城市人在这里纽约，说“我是灵性探索者”是不被接受的，也不体面的。但现在，这非常体面。它几乎是高尚的。它是有洞察力的。

说我是精神上的探寻者，这很明智，但当我阅读这本书时，我发现这是不可接受的。可以说我在寻找，但不能说自己找到了什么。说我在寻求上帝是另一回事。这些书如果写着在怀疑的时代找到上帝，在数字时代找到上帝，就不会放在书架上了。

他们没有谈论的是这一点。而且有趣的是，他们都陷入了这种困境。这是一种困境。他们在广泛地探寻，而不是狭隘地寻找。

这不是一种糟糕的情况。我认为要么选择不寻求，要么定义自己，而不去寻求，是更为舒适的。我一直在思考这个问题，当我审视这些观点时，我发现他们说：“我是精神上的探寻者，但我不属于那些声称已经找到上帝的人。我不再相信可以有确定性。

”现在，这是我的看法： 在我看来，大多数精神上的探寻者都曾参与过宗教机构。其中许多人是在教堂、犹太会堂或其他地方长大的。他们都有某种宗教背景。他们在这些宗教机构中发现，宗教人士更加愤怒、更加不安全、更加评判他人和更加虚伪。

内部有更多的争斗，更多的骄傲和偏见。在宗教机构内比外部更常见的是不安、愤怒、争斗、暴力、虐待和虚伪。我直接说：是的，这是事实。因此，人们说他们在寻找，这是完全可以理解的。

他们被那些自满自足的宗教人士所排斥，又深感精神上的空虚。他们被困住了。有没有出路呢？是有的，我认为有出路。

出路在于首先你要认识到一个谬误。这个谬误就是： 让我这样来说明：假设有一个约翰·多伊，他总是酗酒。为什么呢？星期一晚上，他喝的是金酒兑苏打水；星期二晚上，喝的是伏特加兑苏打水；星期三晚上，喝的是波旁酒兑苏打水。

是什么让他醉了呢？显然是因为苏打水吧？当然不是。同样地，一个狭隘的人认为自己找到了上帝，这并不意味着他的批判态度是由找到上帝的信念引起的。

然而，人们往往就是这么假设的。可能**真正的原因是**其他一些因素。除了宗教上的确定性之外，他们找到上帝还有其他原因。也许有某些其他因素在起作用。

如果这是真的，你克服了这个谬误，就可以最终去阅读《五远书》，也就是最有可能告诉你有关上帝的事情的一本书——圣经。事实上，如果你去看旧约，那里包含了犹太教、伊斯兰教和基督教，这三大宗教加起来几乎占了人类的四分之三。当你审视这一切时，你会发现他们都认为旧约是神圣的。找到上帝的唯一明智的方法就是首先去读一读圣经。

当你阅读圣经时，你会看到它说你可以找到上帝，而不仅仅是寻找上帝。我刚才读的那一段摩西找到上帝的内容非常重要，因为它提供了所有基本的原则。这里有三个东西，但其实并不是三个不同的东西。而是同一个东西被越来越深入地审视。

这就是燃烧的荆棘丛。起初，它只是一个令人分心、扰乱的东西。对摩西来说，最初它只是一处令人分心的地方。当它靠近一些时，他看到这是一股无法控制的力量。

而再靠近一些，他发现其中有一个燃烧的天使。我想告诉你们，在你们看到这三个东西的过程中，你们会经历找到上帝所需的三个阶段。你们必须知道并体验同样的三件事。现在我会在最后总结一下它们是什么。

从现象上看，**这意味着当我从外面看时，首先我们看到它只是一处令人分心的地方。**它把摩西带出了他的正常行动轨迹。然后他走近一些，发现这是一股无法控制的力量。最后，他看到了其中有一个燃烧的天使。

直到你看到这三个东西，经历这三个阶段，你才能找到上帝。现在让我们来看看这三个东西。每个东西都是一个阶段。首先，首先是那燃烧的荆棘丛是一个令人分心的事件。

我所说的“令人分心”，请注意这里在第三和第四节中提到，说摩西看见荆棘丛虽然着火了，却没有烧毁。于是他说：“我要过去看看。”第四节接着说：“耶和华看见他这样做了。”然后他就说话了。

这里的“过去”并不是一个很好的翻译。我认为我们的翻译在这里让我们有些失望。因为这里有一个特定的词被重复使用了两次。更准确的翻译应该是“偏离”，这个词在希伯来文中用来表示离开常规路径，离开正常道路，离开主路。

摩西当时在做什么？他只是在移动他的羊群。他在做自己的事情。他过着平凡的生活。

除非有某些事情扰乱了普通的生活，否则他永远不会开始寻找上帝。你知道，摩西并没有说：“今天我想去寻找上帝。”有些事情必须打断他，让他偏离正常的道路，因为圣经告诉我们，普通生活会让你太忙，这会促使你去寻找上帝。我的意思是这样：你看路易斯在他的《螺丝钉信札》这本书里。

挺有趣的。如果你还没读过的话，读起来很有趣，是一本快速阅读的书。而且它是一部小说，我希望是这样的。这本书讲的是一个资深恶魔写给他的侄子——还在诱惑领域的年轻恶魔的一系列信件。

资深恶魔的名字叫螺丝钉。螺丝钉算是退休了，至少他在地狱的官僚体系中地位更高了一些。他开始给侄子提建议，并告诉他确保病人永远不要落入敌人的手中（当然，这里的敌人是指耶稣）的最佳方法之一是什么。他说：“关于争论的问题是，它会把整个斗争转移到敌人的地盘上。

” 通过争论的行为本身，你就会唤醒病人的理性。一旦它被唤醒，谁能预料结果呢？即使某种思想倾向可以被扭曲以符合我们的利益，你会发现你在病人身上强化了关注普遍问题的致命习惯。通过吸引注意力远离即时感官经验的溪流，你的任务是固定他的注意力在这条溪流上。

教他称之为“真实生活”，不要让他问什么是真实的含义。记住，他不像你。他不是一个纯粹的精神体。你可能没有意识到人类是多么容易被普通生活的压力所束缚。

我曾经有一个病人，一个坚定的无神论者，在大英博物馆阅读时，我发现他的思维开始走向错误的方向。当然，敌人就在一旁。在我还来不及反应之前，我看到我20年辛苦工作开始摇摇欲坠了。如果我失去了头绪，试图用论据来为自己辩护，那我就完了。

但我可不是个傻瓜。我立刻建议说现在大概是他该吃午饭的时候了。敌人想必提出了反对意见——你总能听不清他说的话，他可能认为这比午餐更重要。至少我认为这就是他在我说“好的”时所采取的策略。

实际上，这远比在上午结束前解决它重要得多。病人明显振奋了起来，当我加上“不如先吃午饭，休息一下再重新考虑这个问题”，他已经走到门口了。等他一走出门，战斗就赢了一大半。我给他看了一个正在叫卖午间报纸的小报童。

我又指给他看一辆照常经过的73路公交车。在他还没走到台阶底之前，我已经让他确信：一个人独自埋头书本时产生的那些奇怪想法，通过一点真实的日常生活——比如公交车和小报童——就足够让他明白，那种事情根本不可能是真的。他知道这次差点出了大事，在后来的日子里，他喜欢谈论那种无法言说的现实感，这是保护我们免受镜像逻辑谬误最终的安全保障。如今他已经安全地生活在了我们父亲的房子下面。

只要我们在日常生活中，就不会去寻找上帝。我们太忙了，总是被事情牵着走。感觉经验让我们从不去问“我为什么这么忙？”、“我在做什么？

这些事有什么意义？”、“我的生活到底在成就什么？”这些问题。我们从不问这些问题，因为在日常生活中我们总是太忙了。

必须有某种东西把我们引开，否则我们就无法做到这一点。是什么东西能将我们引开呢？那必须是一棵燃烧的荆棘丛。他转过身去，看到了这个奇怪的现象。

那么，什么是燃烧的荆棘丛呢？它就是与你对现实的看法相矛盾的东西。一把燃烧的灌木丛实际上是一个观念炸弹。它会冲击你对事物应有的认知，并将其炸毁。

现在，我来告诉你燃烧的灌木丛是如何运作的。燃烧的灌木丛是这样工作的：如果某事是真的（我认为这是真的），那么另一些事情就不可能发生。但偏偏有一件这样的事情发生了。因此，那件事就不成立。

明白了吗？你看，我相信这件事是真的。如果某事为真，那么这另一件事就不会发生，这根本不可能。但这确实发生了。

因此，那件事就不成立。这就是燃烧的灌木丛。你看，在这种情况下，如果你是一个经验主义者（即你只相信眼前的事物，并认为一切都是自然原因），不相信超自然现象的人，不相信神秘事物的人，只相信一切都有自然的原因。那么，你会问：什么是燃烧的灌木丛？

这是一个矛盾。因为灌木要么在燃烧并逐渐枯萎，要么是冷的且完好无损，但这个灌木却在燃烧却没有被烧毁。**这意味着生活中还有更多超乎寻常的东西。**如果你没有超自然的观点，燃烧的灌木丛就是一种观念炸弹。

如果这世界就是一切，那么燃烧的灌木丛就不会发生。但燃烧的灌木丛确实发生了。因此，我的观点中必须有更深层次的东西。但是，我对现实的看法必须改变。

现在，燃烧的灌木丛是唯一能让我们从普通生活中解脱出来、停下来思考并集中注意力，从而提出大问题的事物。那么，燃烧的灌木丛会以什么形式出现呢？哦，许多种形式，多种多样的形式。让我给你举四个快速的例子，但它们非常重要。

这正是这个道理告诉我们的一个主要方面：你绝不可能通过某一天抽象地思考，到了35岁我觉得该找上帝了，就能找到上帝。这永远不会发生。你被普通生活的洪流所困住。必须有某种东西把你引开，而这些就是能让你改变方向的事物。

让我举一个快速的例子。四，一个人可以是一个无法解释的燃烧的荆棘丛。我最喜欢的说明之一是一位女士的经历，虽然我在某本书里找到她的确切信息之前，这个例子就在我脑海里。这位女士在早期红门教会规模还很小的时候加入过那里。

她从未过多思考宗教，对宗教也没有太大兴趣，但她在一个镇上的电视台工作，并且她的上司曾经犯了一个错误，如果她被责备的话，可能会失去工作。但她的上司主动承担了责任，因此保住了自己的职位，而她可能无法保住工作。这让她非常惊讶。她说她之前遇到过不少会把错推到她头上的老板，但从没有见过一个愿意替她承担责任的老板。

她对此感到十分震惊，并表示感谢后继续追问：你为什么要这么做？那真是太好了。为什么你会这样做？他试图委婉地回答说：“谢谢。

” 但她坚持要问清楚：“不，这不只是任何人会做的事。” 最终，他说：“我是基督徒。” 她问道：“那又怎样？” 她说：“你知道的，在其他宗教中，上帝做了这样那样的事，但在我们信仰中，我们的上帝亲自来承担了责任。

我的救主替我承担责任，因此我可以为别人承担责任。” 这个观点对她来说是一个巨大的冲击，因为在她看来，宗教让人们成为指责者。这是她见过的唯一一种会让人变成指责者的宗教。你从未想过有一种宗教能够让你变成一个接受指责的人。

你从没见过这样的情况。于是她说：“也许这种宗教是不同的。也许这个人是不同的。” 她问：“你们去哪个教会？

” 答案是红门教会，于是她开始参加那里聚会。因此，她有了一个榜样，并且这个榜样彻底改变了她的看法。让我再给你举个例子。另一种“燃烧的荆棘”不是不可解释的人，而是无法解释的思想过程。

现在我所说的含义是，许多世俗人士开始成为精神探索者，因为他们开始思考作为没有来世、没有超自然现象的世俗人的意义。他们认为一切都是偶然的，一切都是物质和运动。一切都只是物质和运动，一切只是化学、生物学和物理学。很多人开始说：等等，等等。

杰克·迈尔斯在他的《纽约时报杂志》1997年12月刊上的文章中提到了这一点，整期都在讨论精神探索。这篇文章的标题是“宗教卷土重来，信仰随之而来”。正如这个标题所示，人们正在寻找信仰。他们渴望找到答案，但我们还没有准备好去发现。

他说的是： 他问道：对于思考型的人而言，后现代之路是否可以通向一种他们能够实践的宗教？如果答案是肯定的，那么他非常谨慎。我认为第一步将是反思世俗失去信仰。世俗失去信仰。

现在听这个。他说，一个转向宗教的人可能不是为了承认神或宗教的神秘性，而是为了回应这种神秘感——正是这种神秘感促使他们的宗教产生。也就是说，有一种内在的、自身充满神秘性的道德生活的必要性，即使我们无法知道道德的基础是什么。这有点难理解。

除非你读了整段话，否则这是他所说的： 他说，作为世俗人士，因此不应该存在道德。不应该有绝对的道德标准。我说的是，一切都是意见的问题。没有美这种东西。

一切都是化学问题。没有办法说人类比岩石、树木或蝾螈更有价值，因为我们只是偶然的存在。但他这样说：如果我世界观中的观点认为人生只有一次，那么就不存在人类的价值。也就不存在美，不存在**真正的不公，但事实却是**存在的。

现在你看到了吗？如果你愿意思考并观察，你会发现这个人完全失去了理智。他正在想，如果无神论是真的，那么就不会有不公。不会有真正的爱。

不会有美。人们其实并没有价值，但他们确实有价值。**这意味着他几乎所看到的一切都成了燃烧的荆棘丛。**于是他又说：如果我的前提导致了一个我知道是错误的结论，那我必须回去重新检查这些前提。

也许真的有一个神。你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是一个放荡小儿子的故事。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了对那些远离上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得他爱的人说。在他的书《浪子回头》中，提摩太·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心信息——一个既是对叛逆的小儿子也是对苛刻的大儿子的信息，同时也向所有人发出邀请，体验到上帝那慷慨和无尽的恩典。

无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，读《浪子回头》都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。《浪子回头》是我们感谢您本月礼物的方式，以此来帮助福音与生命分享基督那宽广而不懈的爱的信息给全世界的人们。立即访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取您的副本。那是 gospelandlife.com/give。

现在，让我们听听凯勒博士接下来的教学。所以一个不可解释的思想流程可以是一个燃烧的荆棘丛。第三点，不可解释的麻烦。我所说的麻烦就是我们的燃烧的荆棘丛。

哦，我的天。这里的原因是：这尤其对你们这些在场有很多年轻人的情况来说非常重要，因为你们正身处像纽约这样的地方。那么，谁会来到纽约呢？年轻人来到纽约。

你们是那些努力工作的人。你们是那些成绩优秀的人。你们是那些计划周全的人。你们来到了这里，并说：“我要努力工作，我会非常勤奋。

我有这个计划，那个计划。我可以掌控生活。”来吧，世界，我已经准备好了。你们有一个理念：如果我真的、真的很努力工作；如果我真的很聪明，很谨慎；如果我真的很精明，那么我就能应对生活。

生活是可以管理的。哦，不是这样的。当你觉得自己很大，而生活却很小的时候，突然间麻烦来了。你开始觉得自己只是现实这座巨大山峰前的一个小不点。

然后你意识到，那些麻烦就像是燃烧的荆棘丛，正在摧毁你的小小世界模型——那就是你以为自己能够掌控自己的生活，以为自己足够聪明和坚强，足以应对普通的生活。大多数人都会这样想，直到某个麻烦来临。你自己是做不到的。你不能成为自己的救世主。

你不能成为自己的主宰。最后一点：燃烧的荆棘丛可以是一个无法解释的人、一个无法解释的想法、一个无法解释的麻烦，但也可以是一种无法解释的空虚感。实际上，如果你上周在这里的话，我们已经讨论过这个问题了。我们在一次开放论坛上谈到了成功，并引用了维京之声（Village Voice）专栏作家辛西娅·海姆尔（Cynthia Heimel）几年前的一段话，她提到她认识很多没有成名的人后来变得有名了，还有许多在成名前的电影明星。

她发现，当他们成名之后，变得极其愤怒、极度沮丧、极度疯狂、极度抑郁。这里有一部分她在文章中提到的内容我没有读过：我相信当你觉得上帝在捉弄你时，他会满足你最深的愿望，然后在你突然意识到自己想要结束生命的时候开怀大笑。你知道她为什么这么说吗？她说她认识的每一个实现了梦想的人——其实这样的例子并不多。

那些梦寐以求成名的人得到了名望，梦想致富的人获得了财富，梦想成功的人达到了目标。她说，她认识的少数几个人因为以为这会让他们感到满足而变得疯狂，结果却发现这并没有实现他们的愿望。他们以为这会让他们感觉良好，但事实并非如此；他们以为这会让生活变得美好，但实际上没有。因此，他们突然意识到自己内心有一个巨大的空虚，而这个观念就是：这就是救赎，这就是生活的全部，完全被摧毁了。

成功和随之而来的空虚可能是最强大的“燃烧的荆棘”。你看？但是你必须经历一次或多次，否则你永远不会找到上帝。这些困难会来敲门，除非你的老板帮你保住工作。

那当然是最好的情况。但它们往往很糟糕，愚蠢、暴躁且强大。它们确实非常艰难。所以，当它们到来时，请听我的建议：你们中正在寻找的人，这也许已经发生在你们身上了。

也许你正处于开始阶段，某种类似的事情进入了你的生活，你选择了偏离正轨——很好。请问你们愿意偏离吗？“偏离”是什么意思呢？如果摩西当时看了看手表说：“我必须在八点之前把羊群赶回家。

” 你永远不会听说过摩西。他也不会遇见上帝。为什么？因为他处于平凡的生活之中，只是在生活的河流中漂浮。

你需要偏离正轨。你必须花时间。你必须阅读。你必须思考，你必须在某种程度上变得脆弱，因为你得和别人谈谈这些事情。

而且谁知道呢？这会带来什么结果？你必须抽身出来。你必须给它时间。

你必须。你必须腾出空间。哦，请一定要这样做。现在，基督徒们，如果你说，这跟我有什么关系呢？

当然有关。原因如下： 我知道你们不想听这个，但这是事实。找到更多神的方法总是遵循同样的原则——也就是找到神的那些原则。换句话说，找到更多神的原则就是找到神的原则，**这意味着如果你只是按照基督教普通的生活轨迹前行，除非有某种东西来打破你小小的观念体系，否则你永远不会更深入地认识神。**

我们之所以没有成长，之所以不像基督那样生活，并不是因为**我们需要更加努力。**总是因为我们的福音观、对耶稣的理解或圣经中关于神的教导的理解有误。我们读了它，我们认为自己理解了它。比如说，一个普通的基督徒会说：耶稣是我生命的意义。

我是重生得救的人。我是基督徒。耶稣是我生命的意义。然后突然间遭遇职业失败，你准备割腕自杀。

这又意味着什么呢？你以为耶稣是你生命的意义。你以为耶稣是你的义，是你的荣耀和荣耀。你以为你是靠耶稣所做的一切而得救的，而不是靠你自己所做的。

然后来了一个小小的观念体系，把它打破了，结果根本不是那样。你以为你在依靠神，然后突然间出现了一个燃烧的荆棘丛。或者你以为你理解了神，但突然发生了某些事情，你说：神不应该让这样的事发生。在你的神观中，这种事情绝对不该发生，但实际上却发生了。

这就是那个燃烧的荆棘丛。你看？因为就在那里，这就意味着你对神的看法是错误的。不要对神发怒。

要意识到是你自己的看法有问题。这是你的世界观。没有其他方法能让你找到更多关于神的东西，除非用最初发现神的那种方式。其次，在他转身进入的时候，他意识到神有话要说给他听。

很多人会转身进来，但未必听到这些。现在让我这样表达这个观点：这有点自相矛盾，这种自相矛盾总是会让你产生探寻的欲望。这些人的矛盾、麻烦或思想上的冲突等等，但当你真正站在找到神的门槛上时，你会看到一个大矛盾。小矛盾引导你走向大矛盾。

这里就是那个大矛盾： 除非你经历过这个，与之抗争过，它对你来说变得至关重要，否则你就不会遇见**真正的神。而这个大的矛盾是**这样的：神对摩西说话，并且这样说。摩西，摩西，不要再靠近了。这真是一个巨大的矛盾。

为什么？我来告诉你原因。一方面，另一方面，首先，摩西，摩西。在英语中，这样表达似乎不太通顺，因为我们说“摩西，摩西”，那是什么意思呢？

但在希伯来语中，重复一个词表示重要性或强度。在旧约圣经中，有很多地方，在你的译本中读到“大坑”时，实际上原文是“坑坑”。这不是像创世记18章那样，而是说“大坑”。但如果你用希伯来文阅读，会看到“坑坑”，因为在希伯来语中，“大坑”的表达方式就是重复这个词。

同样地，当大卫不仅说亚撒夫，而是说亚撒夫、亚撒夫，我的儿子、我的儿子时；或者耶稣对西门说：“西门，西门，撒旦想要得着你，要筛你像筛麦子一样”，以及耶稣对玛利亚说“玛利亚”时，重复名字表示情感的强度或关系的重要性。这总是意味着我想与你建立关系，总是意味着爱。它总是意味着强度。现在你们开始明白了吗？

当摩西走近时，神说他要更近一些。退后。摩西，摩西，不要靠近。等等。

你看，他说要你接近，却又让你停止。脱下你的鞋吧，这是圣洁之地。这里发生了什么？一方面，他告诉你我是圣洁的神。

这就是为什么他是火之神的原因。火意味着圣洁。火意味着公义。火意味着威严。

火意味着我就是我。而不是你想让我成为的样子。当摩西问他的名字是什么时，神没有说我的名字是你想要的样子。不。

神对摩西说的是我是我。你看，如果他的名字是“你想要的”，那就不会是烈焰，而是会变成黏土。你能随心所欲地对待他吗？人们总是这样开始。

他们说我只是想找找神。你们有信仰很好，这对你们有帮助。这对你来说没问题。而且对你是真的。

但如果你需要信仰，你需要信仰。这是你的真实情况。所以当他们问我要成为基督徒感兴趣时，你应该对他们说：现在要相信这个。也就是说，如果我成为基督徒，我必须做这件事和那件事，我不想做这些事，也不用做这些事。

你们明白发生了什么吗？这就是黏土之神。而不是烈焰之神。你所寻找的是一个适合你的神，而不是你要去适应的神。

你看，在黏土中，它会根据触摸者的形状改变；但在火中，是火改变了触摸者。换句话说，触摸者碰到火时，会被烧成黏土。神一开始就说，如果你想要真正的神，你就必须寻找一个能与你相矛盾的神。如果你想要真正的神，你就必须愿意看到一个告诉你不想听的事情的神。

当有人说：让我直接说吧。当有人说：你知道吗？我有个女朋友/男朋友。我不想成为基督徒，如果**这意味着会妨碍到那件事。**

现在你们说的是什么？> 这完全是自相矛盾。你身在生命的洪流中，所以你并不合逻辑。让我带你出来吧。

你说你知道自己是谁，甚至在他之前就已经知道了。你连上帝都没见过，却知道自己的需要。没见过上帝，却知道性伦理是什么。没见过上帝，却知道自己需要什么。

你怎么可能在还没见到他之前就知道自己是谁呢？如果他是创造者，如果他创造了这一切，那么你不脱鞋就无法开始寻找这位真实的上帝。你看，上帝不会说“我要见你”，然后你才脱鞋。他会说：“你连见我一面都得先脱鞋。

”**这意味着，你必须愿意做你现在不喜欢的事情，如果你真的在那里的话。**而如果你不愿意这么说，大多数现代人都不愿意这么说，那么你就实际上在说：我在寻找上帝，但并不是真正地寻找上帝，现实不是你想的样子。难道你不明白这一点吗？现实就是它自己。

你无法真正改变。也就是说，你啊，身高五尺六寸，体重一百二十五磅，正在锻炼身体，永远不可能成为一名职业橄榄球运动员。我不管你。永远不会。

你可以做任何你想做的事情。只是你做不到。你可能连踢球手都当不上。更别提你一直梦想的线卫了。

现实就是如此。如果真的有这样的人来找你，说：“我想认识你。”你说：“好啊。”然后呢？

你自认为是一个强势、专横的人。他说：“你怎么敢这么说？”其实你根本不想真正了解我。你只是想以这种方式思考，但看看你现在做了什么。

当一个人说他不想要一个不允许他做某些事情的上帝时， 我不想成为一个狭隘的人。你真正想说的是，我拒绝给神同样的尊敬，就像我不愿意对任何人一样。你看，除非从一开始你就脱下鞋子，也就是说，除非你愿意找到一个告诉你不想听的事情并且要求你不想要做的事情的神，否则你连寻找都还没有开始。你不能客观地开始寻找，然后希望我们能找到神。

你必须先说，神啊，如果你在那里，我愿意同意你可能是圣洁的。你可能是烈火。我说了这句话，你们可能会想：等等，如果是这样的话，天哪，天哪，天哪，我不想那样对待神。但是现在这个神也对摩西说：摩西，退后一点。

我是圣洁的，不要随便走进我，不要随意以好奇的心态靠近。你看，要表现出尊敬，要有敬畏之心。愿意为了找到我而屈服。但随后他又说：摩西，摩西，我知道你的名字叫什么，或者你叫什么名字，他要说的是，我想让你加入进来，我想成为你的一部分，我想靠近你。

事实上，“退后一点”这句话本身就是一种矛盾。神在说，我想在我的圣洁中拥有你。但是怎么能让神的圣洁进入我呢？这伟大的、庄严的事物怎么可能降临到我的身上？

你看神是什么样的，你看燃烧的荆棘是什么样的？燃烧的荆棘是圣经宗教的核心矛盾。**真正的神坚持他不仅是**真的圣洁而且绝对圣洁，不仅是真的慈爱而且绝对慈爱。他是燃烧的荆棘。

他是一个另一个矛盾。而世界上其他人拒绝倾听他的真相。宗教徒说神是真的圣洁，我们可以通过尽最大努力做好事来达到天堂。换句话说，他们强调的是圣洁而不是恩典。

这就是为什么我们不喜欢他们的原因。这也是为什么基本上他们没有一个真正享受的神，而是有一个辛苦劳作的神。他们甚至没有一个真正能激发热情的神，因为他们有一个可以控制的神。你有的只是一个驯服的神。

如果你以为靠功德就能上天堂，那不是一团烈火的神。这是一个非常驯服的神。你用钱买通了他。但另一方面，另一些人只看到神的圣洁， 却忽略了祂的爱。

现代人喜欢那种只要接受我们的神，就像罗杰斯先生说的那样： “我就是这个样子爱你。”这也不是一团烈火的神。这是一个感性的神。你不会对这样的神充满热情。

一个说神是圣洁的，偶尔会宽恕人的神， 你不会因为这样的神而喜乐。或者神说：“我接受你就是这个样子，没有任何代价。” 你也不会因此得到满足。除非祂既是圣洁又满有恩典，否则没有火一般的激情。

你看不出其中的矛盾吗？如果你坚持非此即彼——要么真理，要么爱，而不将两者结合，如果坚持认为信一个真正要求严格的神或完全慈爱接受所有人的神，无论你选择哪一边，都无法看到**真正的神。因为真正的神是**一团烈火，祂说：“我要与你建立爱的关系。”这就是耶稣为什么说我们为你吹笛子，你们不跳舞；我们为你唱哀歌，你们不悲伤的原因。

基督教比任何宗教都更加乐观和悲观、更高尚和更低沉。神说：“我是圣洁的神，但出于怜悯我降下来。”基督教在神所做的事上要求更多，也比其他任何宗教更慈爱和宽恕。没有哪个宗教有如此圣洁的神会说：“你们要完美才能进入天堂。

”神在圣经中说了这句话。没有其他宗教这么说，但另一方面，也没有哪个宗教说神会降下来。这就是答案。小矛盾会引领你到神面前，大矛盾则摆在你的面前。

不要忽视这些矛盾。永远不要妥协。永远不要偏离圣经所说的。但是解决方案是什么呢？

圣洁如何能进入我的生活呢？答案是，在那燃烧的荆棘丛中，有一个使者。不是使者。抱歉，我说错了，是一个使者吗？

在旧约里非常重要。每当你们遇见使者并且有人试图崇拜使者时，使者总是说：“起来，我只是一个和你一样的受造物。”但是在旧约里，有一个非常神秘的人物被称为“主的使者”。出埃及记3章2节，主的使者向他显现，并有火焰的火。

现在，这种矛盾如何能够统一呢？答案是，主通过使者说话。荆棘丛中有调解者。使者在荆棘丛中，但主却透过荆棘丛说话。

为什么？因为通过调解者。这个神秘人物存在。但是这位调解者就在火焰之中。

为什么呢？我们都知道答案。整本旧约里，上帝说，如果你要与圣洁的上帝同住并拥有个人关系，就需要有人代替你受罚。所以一次次又一次次，人们将祭物献入上帝圣洁之火中。

当你有罪时，你就献上祭物祈求饶恕，并且是作为替代。有些东西被杀并在火中焚烧。但新约告诉我们原因：因为有一位进入其中，通过自己的一次性牺牲进入了上帝的圣洁之火，他被消耗了，这样我们就不必再被消耗。因为耶稣基督被上帝的圣怒所吞噬，我们才能成为燃烧的荆棘丛。

你知道什么是燃烧的荆棘丛吗？燃烧的荆棘丛是充满上帝圣洁的人，但不会摧毁他们。**这意味着什么？基督徒是充满力量、个性和内住性的人。**

其次，基督徒是美丽的人。事实上，没有任何一幅图像是马丁·路德所说的福音之卡（card of the gospel）更能体现这一点了——用来展示罪人的救赎图像。当你成为基督徒时，因为耶稣基督不是为你的，你同时是公义的也是有罪的；同时你是美丽的但又是荆棘丛。你不是一棵巨大的红杉树。

当你成为基督徒时，你不会变成红杉树，而是会变成燃烧的荆棘。你依然是荆棘，依然是一个罪人，但你却披上了耶稣的义。你被耶稣的美丽所充满。你知道，这正是可能的，并且只有通过这种方式才有可能实现。

如果你不仅看到真理之神，或爱之神，还要看到基督充满公义的声音，以及赦免的信息，能够将奴隶变为儿女、义务变为选择，那么你就会变成一个充满激情和热情的人。你们明白吗？让小矛盾引导你走向大矛盾，并且坚持下去。今晚这是第一次听到这些话的话，请你们一定要认真思考。

你们可能还没有完全理解，我没有讲得很清楚，时间也不够多。但请你们务必深入思考。基督徒朋友们，请记住这一点：如果你需要重新点燃你的荆棘之火，就回到耶稣那里去看看他做了什么。看看他是如何被火焰吞噬的。

看看他之所以被燃烧和吞噬，是为了让我们也能在神的圣洁力量中燃烧而不被毁灭。你越是看到他在荆棘中的燃烧，你就越会成为一棵燃烧但不被烧毁的荆棘。我们来祷告吧。求父帮助我们把这些应用到生活中。

现在很多人正在经历痛苦，我们对此感到烦躁和愤怒。我们没有意识到**这是你用矛盾引导我们走向伟大矛盾的方式——律法在耶稣基督之爱中得到了实现。求你改变我们的心，让我们通过耶稣的名字应用这些真理**到我们的生命中。阿门。
