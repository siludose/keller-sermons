# 为何要公开信仰 / Why a Public Faith

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel and Life. How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King.

This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. Tonight's Scripture comes from a book of John. Chapter 4, verses 27 through 42.

Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, what do you want or why are you talking with her? Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, come, see a man who told me everything I ever did.

Could this be the Messiah that came out of the town and made their way toward him? Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, rabbi eats something, but he said to them, I have food to eat that you know nothing about. Then his disciples said to each other, could someone have brought him food?

My food, said Jesus, is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. Don't you have a saying it's still four months until the harvest? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields.

They are ripe for harvest. Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvest a crop for eternal life so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. Thus the saying one sows and another reeps is true.

I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work and you have reaped the benefits of their labor. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed him because of the woman's testimony he told me everything I ever did.

So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them and he stayed two days. And because of his words, many more became believers. They said to the woman, we no longer believe just because of what you said, now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.

The Word of the Lord. We're beginning a new series called Public Faith. Sharing the hope that s within.

We live in a very pluralistic society, New York particularly. Your neighbor probably holds deeply sharply divergent beliefs about things to your beliefs. Now in a situation like that, pluralistic everybody s so different in their beliefs, here s the question, how can people be true to themselves and not hide who they are and still get along?

I mean no matter who you are, if you care about the social fabric, that s a huge question to answer. Because there s really only three, I think possible alternatives. Either you hide who you are for fear that your neighbor will be angry at you or you speak out about your beliefs and who you are in such a way that you provoke anger in your neighbor or you learn how to share who you are and you are open about who you are, but to do it in such a way that creates peace and civility and of course the third alternative is the only one that has integrity and is the only one that really is, it holds out a prospect of hope for a pluralistic society and therefore even though we re going to be looking at what the Bible says each week about how Christians should be public with their faith, this issue should concern everybody and my goal is to show Christians how they can be part of the solution.

And that means whether you re a Christian or whether you don t believe in Christianity or whether you re not sure what you believe, this will be of relevance to you. And we re all very excited about the fact that thousands of people in not only the beta groups but the small groups in our church are studying this material every week and applying it to real life. Now the first week we re just looking at the very subject of what public faith is and why faith should be public.

And we re looking at what was read to you was the last half of a great story about Jesus Christ meeting a woman of Samaria at the well. It starts at the very beginning of chapter 4 and in a minute I re going to recount it but what I want to do is look particularly at the aftermath and that s here in verses 27 to 42. Immediately after speaking to this woman, Jesus talks to his disciples and he gets real metaphorical and he talks about spiritual sewing, seed and reaping.

Now what is that? What is he trying to get across in that metaphor? I want to delve into that and ask that question.

What is he talking about there? And I like to look at that under three headings. Jesus here actually gives us a call to spiritual sewing of seed and then he shows us in this passage the method of doing it, how to do it, and then thirdly the power or the inner motivation for doing it.

So the call to it, the method of it, the power for it. Okay? Now let s first of all, let s look at the call to spiritual sewing of seed.

What is this? Let me give you the context. What s happened right before this part?

I told you that Jesus has had a very famous and very intriguing encounter with a woman of Samaria at the well. Jesus has been traveling with his disciples and as he s traveling through Samaria he stops at a well. His disciples go into town to get some food, leaving him alone at the well.

A woman also comes out from the town to draw water from the well and they engage in a conversation. And Jesus very gently and persistently tries to draw her out and get her attention and he does it by using a metaphor, an illustration. And he says, I have water that if you drank it, you d never thirst again.

And she says, really? All right? Let me have that water.

And he says, okay, you want the water? Go get your husband. She says, I don t have a husband.

Right? He says, and very matter-facally, non-condemnally, and gently says, you re right. You don t have a husband.

You ve had five husbands and the man you re living with right now is not your husband. Wait a minute. Why, when she said, give me this water of life, this water that satisfies, so you never have to be thirsty again, give this water to me.

And he says, go get your husband. What is he doing? He s brilliantly showing her that he s not talking about physical water, that he s talking about soul satisfaction, soul satiation, the satisfaction of a soul thirst.

And it s what she s been looking for and hoping to get that soul satisfaction in men, in family, in romance, in sexual relationships, and it hasn t happened to her. And now amazed with his insight, surprised at how much he knows about her, impressed with how loving it is for him to be talking to woman in public, and perhaps sensing a hidden power. And she calls him out, and she says, you know, when Messiah comes, he will tell us about all these deep things.

And Jesus very dramatically says, I, the one speaking to you, am he. And that is verse 26, that s the first 26 verses of chapter 4. And immediately upon him telling her this, did disciples come back?

See, verse 27, the disciples returned. She, verse 29, leased her water jug and goes into the town to start talking to her friends about what just happened to her, and we ll get back to that in a second. But in this context of him pointing her to eternal life and pointing her to belief in himself, and then her going off and pointing the people of the town to him, he gives this metaphor.

He says, first of all, I have a food, this is now in verse 33, he's using the kind of enigmatic, cryptic, metaphorical way that ancient sages would speak to the disciples as a way of trying to get them to think, draw them out, focus their attention. And he says, I have a food, and that food is to do the will of him who sent me into finishes work. Now right there, even that sentence all by itself is fascinating, because he's actually saying, my meat and my drink, that which gives me sustenance.

The main thing I do is the work that God has given me, the one who sent me has given me this work. Well, what is this work? Then he calls it harvesting or spiritual sowing and reaping.

And the reason we know is spiritual, the reason we know that what he's talking about as a metaphor, is because he talks about here in verse 36, he says, we're talking about a crop of eternal life, and therefore here's what he's saying, especially in context of, he's talking metaphorically about what just happened with the woman, and what's happening now between her and her friends. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ, and spiritual reaping is seeing some of them believe. Spiritual sowing is pointing people to Jesus Christ and saying there is eternal life, spiritual reaping is sometimes seeing them believe.

And Jesus makes a couple of amazing statements about this. First of all, he's telling his disciples, this is a, remember, this is food, what does that mean? That being public with your faith, pointing people to eternal life through Jesus Christ is not dessert, it's not hors d'oeuvres, it's not optional, it's not a treat, it's not something special, this is meat and drink, this is what you should be here to do, and this is what God has put me here to do, and you should be doing it too.

Not only does he show that how important it is to be public with faith, telling people about eternal life through Jesus, but he even makes, he bursts the boundaries of this metaphor when he says, so that sower and the reaper may be glad together. Do you know how radical it is? The reason it doesn't immediately hit you is because you are not farmers.

Sowers go out, and months later reapers go out, right? He even mentions the fact that very often there's months between sowing and reaping. He says, ah, but when it comes to the gospel, the message of eternal life through Jesus Christ, the sower and the reaper rejoiced together, what does that mean?

There is no natural seed that's so powerful that the sower and the reaper can go out together. You know what he's talking about? He's talking about the sower going out like this, and the reaper can be right alongside and picking up, you know, the sower puts in the sea.

Up it comes, the reaper takes, and they're working together. Sowers and reapers can never work together because there's no seed that powerful, but the gospel is that powerful. So Jesus is saying, don't say this isn't the harvest time, lift up your eyes.

I'm here. Got it? This is really very, very strong.

Never say this isn't the right cultural moment. Never say this isn't the time. Never say, well, sharing faith publicly, that's something for certain people.

No, it's meat and drink. It's for my disciples. It's the work I've been given to do.

Don't say this isn't the time. It is the time. And do you see the power so powerful that the spiritual sea, in this spiritual sea, the sower and the reaper rejoice together?

This does not mean, by the way, that everybody who hears the gospel believes immediately. It's not talking individualisticly. It's not just, you can see in the book of John, you can see in your own life, that people come to faith in different stages.

But what he's saying is in the past, John the Baptist, the prophets, they spoke enigmatically, vaguely about it, but now I'm here. It's clear the gospel message is here, and now it's got power. So today is the day of salvation.

So that's the first thing we learn here. He's calling us the spiritual sowing in very powerful terms. If you're his disciple, if you follow him.

Well, that makes us a little bit nervous. What exactly is it that he's calling us to? What does this mean?

So let's take a look. What he's talking about metaphorically, the woman is doing right now. Look at what she's doing.

It says, leaving her water jar, verse 29, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, and these are people that she lives with, these are people she knows. Come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?

So they came out of the town and made their way toward him. There it is. Okay, how do we analyze this?

What does this mean? First of all, please notice that she doesn't get up on a box and start preaching. Now, to get up and preach to a group of people at once is fine, I do it myself.

And as Jerry Seinfeld has said, nothing does anything wrong with that. But she doesn't do that because, of course, not everybody's called with that. That's not the essence of what Jesus is calling his disciples to do, to get up like this.

Also notice she goes to people she knows. She doesn't go grab strangers. Again, not that there's anything wrong with that.

But that's still not the essence. And by the way, I don't care who you are. We'll get back to this in a minute, but you can already tell.

She has a kind of checkered sexual history. She is not a moral pillar of her community. But in every community, there's always a ladder.

Even we Americans who love to say we're part of a egalitarian meritocratic society, there's always pecking orders. There's always ladders. You know, there's people above you in your career.

There's people below you. There's people older than you, younger than you. People got more.

The things you want, people who got less. And therefore, it doesn't matter if you're high up on the ladder. Talking about your faith is scary.

Why? Because you got a lot to lose. What about other people up there who are going to say, what am I?

Are you a fanatic or something? If you're in the middle of the ladder, that's not easy either. Why?

Because you don't want the people above you to think you're kind of... And they want... They want them to be able to open doors for you, think well of you.

But even if you're at the bottom of the ladder, like her, you don't want to add insult to injury. I mean, you don't want people to say, look, we always knew you're kind of a shady character. We know you're crazy, too.

There's always something to lose. But she goes, and she speaks. And she...

And this one statement actually can be broken into two parts to show us the essence of what it means to be publicly your faith. What it means to do this spiritual selling that Jesus calls all of us disciples to do. He says, come see a man who told me everything I ever did.

Now, the two essentials of this, of being publicly your faith are simple transparency and pointing to Jesus himself. First of all, simple transparency. Look, what does she say?

He told me everything I ever did. Now, look, this is... She does not have a set of bullet points.

There's not much theological content here. She's not explaining substitutionary atonement. She is just saying, here's what happened to me.

She is simply being transparent about what's going on inside. And this is the first thing you have to understand. Basically, being publicly your faith simply means not hiding your heart.

Not hiding the wellsprings of your life. Not hiding from other people who you really are. If you just stop hiding and you're just natural and letting people know how you make decisions, how you deal with your problems, if you're a Christian, you're just letting people see who you are, and then it becomes very natural.

See, look, you don't necessarily talk to anybody about these things, but a person doesn't have to be a dear friend for you to share three things. One is, do you ever talk to people about how you're dealing with a problem or your stress is in your life? Do you ever say...

Does anybody say I've been pretty stressed out lately? You know, and I've had a deal with it. Do you ever talk to people about decisions you make?

Do you ever talk to people about priorities that you set? Now, you can talk to people who are not necessarily your closest friends, but when you are getting to know people, you disclose a little bit more and a little bit more. And when you get to that level, if you're a Christian, and you don't disclose the fact that Jesus is always part of how you deal with your problems, the Jesus is always part of how you make your decisions.

If you get to the level where you can be disclosing that, but you don't share that part of your heart, you are short-circuiting the natural level of disclosure and transparency that happens as you're getting to know somebody better. So, in other words, public faith is just don't short-circuit it, don't hide it. Look, we all know that people don't want to hear it, especially in our culture.

But the point is that it's unnatural, it's wrong. It's a lack of transparency. So, you don't have to learn a bunch of bullet points or get up on a box, you just have to stop being dishonest about how you make your decisions and how you deal with your issues.

Just don't hide. Just don't hide. That's the first thing, personal transparency.

But the second thing, notice is this. She doesn't say, come to a seminar, come read a book, she says, come see a man. Now, I already said this.

She doesn't understand too much about Jesus yet. I mean, she says he's the Messiah or he might be the Messiah, all right. But does she know he's going to die for her or for me and you?

No. Does she know he's going to rise from the dead? No.

And those are really big things. She definitely doesn't know too much theology here. And yet somehow, she has grasped the essence of the distinction between Christianity and all of the religions.

She's actually grasped the genius of Christianity. What is that? Well, I would say that every other religion, the main thing in that religion, is the way.

The way. So, for example, the founder, the teacher, the prophet, the sage, the founder of the religion comes and says, here's the five pillars. Here's the eightfold path to enlightenment, the ten-nubbelchers.

In other words, they're giving people the way. They're saying if you want to find God, if you want to find salvation, if you want to connect to the divine, if you want to be enlightened, if you want salvation, if you want favor with God, if you want a relationship with God, here's the way. You do this and do this and do this and think about it.

Buddhism has a very well laid out path. Four noble truths and the last noble truth is the eightfold path. And do you have to know all about Buddha for the way to work?

I mean, couldn't you find enlightenment without necessarily knowing that much about Buddha? Of course not. The answer is you don't need to know a lot about Buddha.

Why not? Because Buddha brought the way, but the main thing is the way. There's someone to touch from the person who brought it.

The main thing is, since you're the one, through your efforts, that they kick God's favor and get the relationship with God, then the important thing is the way. It's the steps. It's the plan.

It's the formula. That's the important thing. Not the founder, not the prophet, but totally different in Christianity.

In John 14, when someone says to Jesus, Lord, you know the way. Jesus says, I am the way. Lord, you have the words of truth.

I am the truth. I am the way. I am the truth.

When Martha says to Jesus, Lord, my brother died, but he will rise again at the resurrection on the last day. What does Jesus say? Martha, I am the resurrection in the life.

I am the way. I am the truth. I am the way.

Why is he talking like that? Is he just being arrogant? No.

Here's what he's saying. I am the way means all of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I am God come to find you.

All of the religious tell you what to do to find God. I have come to do what you couldn't do for yourself. I have come to give you salvation as a gift, see.

We always say the gospel changes everything and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend giving one to a coworker or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith.

It's a simple way to start a Gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to Gospel and Life.com slash give. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com slash give.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. And therefore, every other religion, the teacher, the founder, that's not an important thing.

What's really important is that you're good and that you do the thing. You follow the way. But in Christianity, it's all about Jesus.

Jesus is the one that you rely on. Jesus is the one. He's the way.

He's the truth. He's the life. People are constantly saying to me, over the years, so often I've heard people say, look, I'm glad you're a Christian, that's great.

But I believe that all good people can get to heaven. Let me repeat that just so you hear it and see the false assumption there. Oh, I'm glad you're a Christian.

But I believe all good people can get to heaven. What's the assumption? The assumption is that Christians think that their goodness gets them to heaven, but they shouldn't be so narrow as to think that only Christians are good.

But Christians don't believe that goodness gets them to heaven. In fact, the genius of Christianity, the heart of Christianity, is we've stopped the exhausting activity of trying to depend on our own goodness. We've escaped the exhaustion of depending on our own goodness and we're depending on Jesus' goodness, which means you can't talk about what's happening in your heart as a Christian without talking about Jesus.

You can't avoid it. You have to be pointing to his beauty. You have to be pointing to him, and she understood that.

And so there's the essence of what it means to be public with your faith. Just be transparent about what's going on in your heart, but you must talk about, you must refer to, you must point to Jesus. Now, this is New York City, and many of you who live here know that the 18 minutes that I've just spent are completely offensive to most New Yorkers.

Because most New Yorkers say this, it's all right for you as Christians to believe what you believe, but you should not convert people. You should not tell people that Christianity is better or truer than their beliefs and that they should change. You should not try to convert people.

You should not say your beliefs are better or truer than theirs and that they should change. You mustn't do that. You've heard that statement before.

Maybe you believe that. I want to show you for two reasons that that's absolutely wrong. That statement's absolutely wrong.

It's absolutely wrong personally, and it's absolutely wrong logically. First of all, personally. I mean, the heart doesn't work that way.

Imagine a group of families all of whom had one member with MS, multiple sclerosis, a terrible, terrible disease. And imagine that they all had those members using, taking a treatment using a particular medicine, the same medicine. And what they found that most of the families found that their MS member was cured.

And what if some of the other families found that because of the medicine, they were dramatically improved. And they got together and they began to compare notes and compare experiences and study, and they came to the conclusion that this is the cure for MS. And the world needs to see it.

So they create a foundation and they create platforms and they get the word out. Now, how would you regard them? I think you would look at them and say, they may be right.

They may be wrong. But there's nothing narrow about them saying, this is the cure. They may be right.

They may be wrong. But of course, if they think they have the cure and they've experienced it like that, of course, they're going to do that. Now, you may think a couple of them are a little overbearing.

Maybe they kind of come on kind of hard. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with the campaign. There's nothing wrong with them wanting to do this and to come to the world and say, this is the cure.

Okay, well, why would Christians be any different? They aren't different except that they're more so. Because Christians don't just believe they have a cure for one disease.

They believe they have something even more foundational. And so they have to go to the world and say, this is the cure. And so you ought to say, well, they may be right or they may be wrong.

And some of them may be overbearing. And by the way, a lot of Christians are overbearing. But there's nothing particularly narrow about it.

There's nothing narrow about it. It's absolutely natural. In the Atlantic Monthly, recently, there was an interesting article.

It was actually quite a cool article on college atheists. In other words, people who've raised in the church go to college and become atheists. The whole article about them.

And there's this one line I want to or this one couple of sentences I want to read you. In it, there's this quote, quote, without fail, former church attending students express similar feelings to Michael, a polypsych major at Dartmouth who said, quote, I really can't consider a Christian, a good moral person if he isn't trying to convert me. See, now that's exactly right.

Why? If you're a Christian and you believe the claims of Jesus and you really think that you've got this cure as it were, then Michael's trying to say, if you're a good moral person, you've got to be trying to convert me. Oh, I'm sure he doesn't want this to be overbearing.

He doesn't want Christians to be, you know, uncivil, you know, I don't know that stuff. But he's trying to say is, if you believe this, then you're not a good person if you're not trying to convert me because you're not trying to convert me. You don't love me or you don't believe it.

But it's not just so to say, well, Christians can believe what they believe, but they shouldn't try to convert people. They shouldn't try to say that their beliefs are better or brighter than other people ought to abandon their beliefs and adopt you. You shouldn't do that.

First of all, I try to show you personally that doesn't make sense, but secondly, it doesn't logically make sense. I'm going to be brief about this, but it doesn't logically make sense. To say, you must not say that your beliefs about spiritual reality are better than anybody else's.

You know, all religions are equally important and right or valuable to the people. If it helps them, it helps them. You should say that your take on spiritual reality is better than anybody else's.

Do you realize what you're doing? At that very moment, you're doing the very thing you're telling other people they can't do. So, for example, there's a couple of ways to put it.

If you say no one's faith position about the nature of spiritual reality is the superior one. But to say that is a faith position, you can't prove it scientifically, and you're saying that it's superior. You're saying that the idea that all religions are equally right is superior to the view that one religion is wrong.

Listen, if it's arrogant to say that one religion is right, why is an arrogant to say one way of thinking about religions is right? Because what you're really trying to say is my thinking that all religions are right is better than your thinking than only your religion is right. Which means, I think I'm right.

And I think it would be better if you believe what I believe. And I think you should change your beliefs. Uh-oh.

You see, you can't avoid making truth claims. Exclusive truth claims. As soon as you say nobody should make a truth claim, that's a truth claim.

As soon as you say nobody should say you shouldn't say your beliefs are righter than my beliefs. But at that moment you're saying that your beliefs are righter than my beliefs. You can't overcome this.

Now, as soon as you realize that everybody makes exclusive truth claims, Christians are no different than anybody else. Everybody, therefore, has faith in things that they can't prove and is trying to get other people to believe what they believe because they think it'd be better for the world if you believe this way rather than this way. Everybody's doing that.

Now, okay, can I step out for a second and say some of you may conclude rightly that I've had a lot of conversations like this in my lifetime, and I have. And let me just tell you that when you get to this place where the person who is saying, oh, you know, Christians shouldn't be converting people and they shouldn't be public with their faith and they shouldn't be telling them that they're other people are wrong. When I get into this place where I say you're doing the very thing you're telling me not to do and they say, no, I'm not.

And then you say, but you're doing it again. You're doing it again. You're doing it again.

At a certain point, they get a little frustrated, not with me, I'm sure. And they say something that I'm actually very sympathetic to. They say, but how are we going to have world peace then?

If everybody's out there saying my religion is the right religion, we're going to have violence. How are we going to have world peace? Okay, that's right, that's the problem.

But for a moment, may I just ask you to do something with me? Actually, I'm going to play the age card on you, in fact, my age card. I'm old enough to remember when the people who are trying to blow us up literally, were the communists.

They're the ones who were trying to blow us up. Therefore, and they were atheists. So the atheists were the enemies of freedom and democracy.

And the religion, of course, is the friend of freedom and democracy. That's what it was in the 50s and 60s and all that when I was growing up. But now we live in an era in which religious fundamentalists are trying to blow us up.

Isn't that right? It's not the atheist anymore. It's religious fundamentalists.

So now everybody says, the enemy of freedom and democracy is religious fundamentalism. And of course, atheism now looks like it's free thinking and free. Could we please escape our cultural moment for a second and rise up, not grow up.

Rise up and be objective for a minute. Religion is not the source of violence. And atheism is not the source of violence.

Because actually you have Pol Pot, Cambodia, killing fields, atheists, communists. You've got the crusades. No, no, no.

It's human nature. That's the source of violence. It's not religion or irreligion or atheism.

It's human nature. And I can tell you what is not going to help human nature. What's not going to change human nature.

Telling people don't make any truth claims when you actually are. That's just irritating. If you think, if violence is coming from human nature and you think, oh, the solution is, let's everybody get private.

Nobody say that anybody is claiming to have the truth, which of course is the truth claim, which doesn't work at all. It just frustrates everybody, furiates a lot of people. Well, then what are we going to do about human nature?

Ah. Point three. Look at Jesus.

Look at His motivation. Jesus, of course, is pointing this woman away from her natural beliefs to new beliefs. But look how He's doing it.

See, the real question is not. The real question is not. How do we get people to stop making truth claims?

Because you can't do that. The real question is, whose truth claims are going to lead most to peace? Or whose view of things is going to produce in them the ability to speak respectfully and gently and lovingly to people with whom they deeply differ?

Do you hear that? Well, let's take a look. First of all, look at verse 27.

Just then is disciples returned and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. But no one, why were they surprised? Do you know?

This was a patriarchal society in which men did not speak to women in public usually. Why? Because they were beneath.

It was beneath them. This was also a racist society in which Jews saw Samaritans as half-breeds. Thirdly, this was a moralistic society.

And a moralistic society in which here's a rabbi talking to a woman who's had five husbands and is living with a man who probably came in midday to draw water and not come in the early in the morning to draw water with the other woman because he was probably something of a social outcast. Here's a man speaking to a woman. Here's a Jew speaking to a Samaritan.

Here's a rabbi speaking to a fallen woman. And that just wasn't done, but he's doing it. And not only that, by the way, some commentators point out that a well was a pickup place.

And here's Jesus with a woman alone at the well and he's engaging her. And when the disciples come, they're amazed. And by the way, if you go up into the narrative in the early parts, she was also just as shocked that this guy would even talk to her.

She was on the wrong side of every fence the world puts up. She was a moral outsider, a racial outsider. She was a woman, not a man.

She was Samaritan, not a Jew. She was immoral, not moral. And yet Jesus engages her.

Why? He doesn't care what anybody thinks. Why?

There's basically there's two motivations for telling people you ought to change your beliefs. One is pride. I'm right and you're wrong.

The other is love. I want you to have what I have. And Jesus Christ is just filled with love.

This isn't the way an arrogant, proud, self-righteous person operates. So he was that way he wouldn't be talking to her at all. And so he is pointing her to eternal life and he is trying to change her beliefs.

But so obviously out of love, how do we get that? If you could be open with who you are and be able to be public with your faith. But like that, then you'd be part of the solution in the world, right?

That's what we need. Not people that hide who they are. Not people that speak out in a way that's belligerent and that aggravates people.

But a way that's true to who you are, but at the same time respectful and gentle. How do we get that? Here's how we get it, the way she got it.

Look at verse 29. Then leaving her jar, water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Now look carefully.

This is, you know, in small towns, everybody knows everything. So notice what she's saying. She's not just saying, gosh, is he clairvoyant or something?

Oh no. Oh no. What are you saying?

There's a Jewish rabbi offering me the water of life and he knows all about me. He told me everything I ever did. Can you imagine her friend saying, he knows everything?

Yes. He knows about Harry and Peter and Joe and, yes. And she said, he saw me to the bottom.

He saw me at my worst, but he was offering me the eternal life. You know, this is very weird. Here's a rabbi in Jesus.

And he's offering her eternal life. He's offering her, remember what that water is? He calls it the water that, if you drink it, you'll never be thirsty again.

What do you mean? It's soul satisfaction. And he is saying, though, you've been looking for it all the wrong places, I can give it to you now.

Now, as a Jewish rabbi, why wouldn't he say and said, well, look, you know, dear? I know you mean well, but you know, you've had a really bad track record. And maybe what you need to do is I'd like to see you just sort of keep your nose clean for six weeks, you know, pull your act together, you know, straighten up and fly right for about six weeks, come back and we have a second appointment.

And maybe then you'd be ready for the water of life. You know, maybe then you'd be, you know, worthy of it. No, no, no, no, no, no.

He sees her to the bottom and still offers. See, he saw everything I've ever done. He said, I don't care about your sexual history.

Now, you know why Jesus can do that? He can offer us the water of life free, even though we don't deserve it. Because on the cross, he said, I thirst.

When he was up on the cross at one of the things he cries out, I thirst. Was he just physically thirsty? Probably not.

He was being separated from God. His soul was shriveling up. He was experiencing what we deserve to experience because we don't live the life we should.

But because Jesus Christ went onto the cross and took our sins, and took the punishment we deserve so that when we believe in him, God can accept us and he can give us the water of life freely. That's grace and you know that changes your identity. What do I mean by that?

Sociologists talk to say, in fact, some social theorists actually say, that everybody has their identity based on difference. That is, I feel good about myself because I'm not like them. I feel good about myself because I'm not like them.

You know that the old prayer that Jewish men prayed centuries ago, you get up in the morning and say, oh Lord, I thank you that you didn't make me a slave, a gentile or a woman. I got self-esteem because I'm not a woman because I'm not a slave because I'm not a gentile. What is that?

That's pretty obvious. And yet, you know, that is an identity based on difference. In other words, I'm better than you.

And honestly, even though it's not usually that overt, when people say, I have traditional values. And somebody else over there says, well, I'm a progressive open minded person. Somebody else says, well, I am a religious moral person.

Somebody else says, well, I'm a free thinker. You can just tell the background is, I'm not like them. And if you belong to any other religion of Christianity or if you actually think you're a Christian and pretty much don't understand the gospel, which is true of many, many people, you believe that you have a relationship with God because you're a good person, because you've tried hard, because you're moral.

And therefore, when you meet somebody who doesn't believe in God, you can assume that you're better than they are. And then your motivation for sharing your faith publicly is one of pride and arrogance, and you just like telling people they're wrong. What if your salvation was not achieved but received?

What if it comes in unmerited? What if your self-esteem is based on a gift? What if your salvation comes not because you're better, but because you have admitted that you're not better than anybody else, and that you need great salvation?

And you know your loved, despite your bad record, that creates a new kind of identity, a new kind of identity so that when you talk to someone, if you know you're saved by grace, not because you're better, not because you're wiser, and you talk to somebody who doesn't believe, doesn't have salvation, you would never assume that person you're necessarily better than they are, because you're not saved because you're better. They might be better. They probably are better.

They're probably wiser in some way or more self-controlled in some way. Maybe a better husband, a better wife, a better father, a better mother than you, why not? Because you're not saved by being a good father, a good mother, a wise person.

No, no, no. All the superiority is gone. You have a different kind of identity.

And because you have a different kind of identity, because you've seen that Jesus has died on the cross for you, because you see that because he said I thirst, you can get the water of life freely, you become part of the solution. You become someone who can talk about your faith out of love, but without the haughtiness, without the self-righteousness. Look at this.

She was able to say to her, I don't care about your sexual history. I don't care if you're a hitman for the mob. I can offer you this water of life because I said I thirst.

And she goes back to her friends and said, he saw me at my worst and loved me. I've never met a man like this. Come see this man.

He saw me to the bottom, but loved me to the skies. You know, she was a great witness and she didn't know much about Christianity really. You and I know a lot more.

What is our excuse? Let's pray. So Father, thank you so much for eternal life.

It comes to us through the thirst, the cosmic thirst, the death of Jesus Christ. We do want to be part of the solution. We live in a pluralistic society.

We desperately need people who know how to share who they are, that is disarming, respectful, loving, brave. And we pray, Father, you would make us that, those kinds of people. Thank you for giving this to us through the grace of Jesus Christ who came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.

His name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life Podcast.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《福音与生活》。我们如何分享真正认识耶稣的意义？不仅仅是作为历史人物或道德教师，而是作为救主和君王。本月，提摩太·基勒尔将探讨圣经中关于公开信仰、分享我们在基督里的盼望的内容。

今晚的经文出自约翰福音第四章27至42节。这时，他的门徒回来了，惊讶地发现他正在与一个女人谈话。但没有人问：“你想要什么？为什么和她说话？

”然后，离开水罐，那女人回到城里对人们说：“你们来看一看，有一个男人告诉我我一生所做过的一切。” 这难道是他们从城中出来的弥赛亚吗？正巧，他的门徒催促他说：“拉比，去吃点东西吧。”但他对他们说：“我有食物，你们不知道。

”接着，他的门徒彼此说：“有人给他送吃的来了吗？” 耶稣说：“我的食物就是行差遣我来的父的旨意，并且成就他的事。难道你们没有说过还有四个月才到收割的时候吗？我现在告诉你们：举目细看田地，庄稼已经熟了，可以收割了。

收割的人已经有工钱，也收割庄稼得着永生的果子，使撒种的和收割的一同欢欢乐乐。正如那说‘撒种的要撒种，收的人要收’的话是真的。我差你们去收割你们所没有劳苦的田地；别人虽然劳苦，你们还是因为他们的劳苦得了收获。”许多撒玛利亚人听见了这话，就信从了耶稣。

这女人因着耶稣向她作的见证，就信了。当撒玛利亚人来到耶稣那里时，他们请他住在他们那里，他就住了两天。因耶稣的话，更多的人相信了他。他们对那妇人说：“现在我们不再凭你的话就信了；因为我们听见他自己说了这话。

” 这是主的道。我们现在开始一个新的系列——《公开信仰》，分享我们心中的盼望。我们生活在一个非常多元化的社会中，尤其是在纽约。你的邻居可能对某些事情的看法与你截然不同。

在这种情况下，当每个人都有不同的信仰时，问题来了：人们如何忠于自己而不隐藏自己的身份，同时又能和平相处？无论你是谁，如果你关心社会的和谐，这是一个巨大的挑战。我认为只有三种可能的选择。要么为了怕邻居生气而隐藏自己的真实身份；要么公开表达你的信仰和自我，从而激怒邻居；要么学会分享真实的自我，并以一种创造和平与文明的方式进行交流。

当然，第三种选择是唯一有道德 integrity 的，也是唯一能为多元化社会带来希望的选择。因此，即使我们每周都会探讨圣经中关于基督徒如何公开信仰的内容，这个问题也应引起每个人的重视。我的目标是向基督徒展示他们如何成为解决方案的一部分。**这意味着无论你是基督徒、不信基督教还是不确定自己的信仰，这都与你有关。**

而且我们非常兴奋地看到，不仅在测试小组，还有我们教会的小组成员每周都在研究这些材料，并将其应用于实际生活。现在第一周我们将探讨公开信仰的概念及其重要性。而我们阅读的内容是耶稣基督与撒玛利亚妇人在井边相遇的精彩故事的最后一半。这个故事从第4章开始，接下来我会重述这个故事，但我更想重点分析故事的后续部分——从27节到42节。

在与这位妇女交谈后，耶稣转向他的门徒，并用隐喻的方式谈论了灵性播种、种子和收获的概念。现在这是什么意思？他在那个比喻中想表达什么？让我们深入探讨这个问题。

他在这里到底在说什么呢？我通常会从三个角度来分析。耶稣实际上在这里给我们指出了灵性播种的呼召，并且在这段经文中展示了播种的方法，以及第三点，就是进行这种播种的动力或内在动机。首先，我们要看看这个灵性播种的呼召是什么。

让我先给你提供一些背景信息。在这一部分之前发生了什么？我告诉过你们，耶稣曾经与撒玛利亚的一个女人在井边有过一次非常著名且引人入胜的对话。耶稣和他的门徒们正在旅行，当他们经过撒玛利亚时，在一个井边停下来。

他的门徒们进镇里去买食物，留下他独自一人在井边。这时，一个女人也从镇上出来打水，于是他们开始交谈。耶稣非常温柔且坚持不懈地试图吸引她的注意，并通过比喻的方式进行引导。他说：“我有一种水，你喝了以后就再也不渴了。

” 她问：“真的吗？那我现在可以尝一尝吗？” 耶稣回答说：“你想喝这种水吗？那你先去找你的丈夫。

” 她说：“我没有丈夫。” 耶稣平静地、不带谴责地说：“你说得对。你曾经有过五个丈夫，而现在和你在一起的男人也不是你的丈夫。” 为什么当她说要给他这生命之水时，他却让她去找她的丈夫呢？

他究竟在做什么？他巧妙地表明自己不是谈论物理上的水，而是在谈论灵魂的满足、心灵的饱足，即灵魂的渴求得到满足。而这正是她一直在寻找和渴望的东西——在男人、家庭、浪漫关系以及性关系中找到灵魂的满足，但这一切都没有实现。现在，她对他深刻的理解感到惊讶，对他的博学感到意外，并且被他公开与女性交谈的爱心所打动，或许还感到了某种隐藏的力量。

于是她直接质问他：“你知道吗？当弥赛亚来的时候，他会告诉我们这些深奥的事情。” 耶稣非常戏剧性地说：“我就是向你们说话的人。” 这是第4章第26节的内容。

在他告诉她的那一刻，门徒们回来了。看，第27节说门徒们回来了。她，则在第29节放下水罐，回到城里开始与朋友谈论刚刚发生的事情。我们一会儿再回到这一点。

但在他引导她指向永恒的生命和相信自己，并且她离开后向城里的人民介绍他这个背景下，耶稣给出了一个比喻。他说：“首先，我有一种食物。” 这是在第33节，他用了一种神秘而隐喻的方式来与门徒们交流，试图激发他们的思考，引导他们集中注意力。他说：“我有一种食物，这种食物就是遵行派遣我来之人的旨意完成的工作。

” 仅这句话本身就很引人入胜，因为他实际上说，我的食粮和饮料就是那给予我力量的东西。主要的事情是完成上帝给我指定的任务，那位派遣我去的人给了我这个任务。那么，这个任务是什么呢？他称之为收割或灵性播种与收获。

我们知道这一点是因为灵里的原因，因为他在第36节中提到，他所谈论的是一种永恒生命的收成。也就是说，在这个上下文中，他用比喻的方式谈论刚刚发生在他和那妇人之间的事情，以及现在她与她的朋友们之间的互动。灵里的播种是指通过耶稣基督将人们指向永恒生命，而灵里的收割则是看到其中一些人相信。灵里的播种是让人们认识耶稣基督，并告诉他们那里有永恒的生命；灵里的收割有时就是看到他们相信。

耶稣在这段话中做了几条令人惊叹的陈述。首先，他对门徒说：“这就像食物一样。”**这意味着什么？公开分享你的信仰、将人们指向通过耶稣基督获得的永恒生命不是甜点，不是开胃菜，不是可有可无的东西，也不是特别的事情，这是你们应该做的事情，也是神让我来做的，你们也应该去做。**

不仅如此，他不仅强调了公开分享信仰的重要性，告诉人们通过耶稣可以获得永恒生命，而且还突破了这个比喻的界限，他说：“因此播种者和收割者可以一同欢乐。”你知道这有多激进吗？你之所以没有立刻意识到这一点是因为你不是农民。播种的人出去，几个月后收割的人才去，对吧？

他甚至提到了从播种到收割之间通常有几个月的时间。他说：“但是当涉及到福音——通过耶稣基督的永恒生命的信息时，播种者和收割者可以一同欢乐，**这意味着什么？没有一种自然的种子是如此强大以至于播种者和收割者可以在同一时间出去。**你知道他在说什么吗？

他是在说播种的人这样出去，而收割者可以立即跟上，就像播种者撒下种子一样。收割的时刻到了，收割者来了，他们正在一起工作。播种者和收割者永远无法合作，因为没有一种种子能如此强大，但福音却如此强大。所以耶稣说，不要说这不是收获的时候了，要抬起头来。

我在这里。听清楚了吗？这非常、非常重要。永远不要说这不是恰当的文化时机。

永远不要说这不是时候。永远不要说，公开分享信仰是某些人的事。不，这是饮食之事。这是我的门徒的工作。

这是我被赋予的任务。不要说这不是时候。现在就是时候了。你看到这种力量了吗？

在灵性的海洋中，播种者和收割者一起欢欣鼓舞。顺便说一句，并不是每个人听了福音都会立刻相信。这并不是在谈论个人层面的事。你可以从约翰福音或你的生活中看出，人们在不同的阶段来到信仰之中。

但他要说的是，在过去，施洗约翰、先知们含蓄地、模糊地说过这件事，但现在我在这里了。福音的信息是如此清晰有力，所以今天就是拯救的日子。这就是我们从这里学到的第一件事。他用非常强有力的语言呼唤我们成为灵性的播种者。

如果你是他的门徒，如果你跟随他。这让我们有点紧张。他到底在召唤我们做什么？这意味着什么？

让我们看看。他所比喻的，这个女人现在正在做的事情是什么。看她做了什么。经文说，在第29节中，妇人离开她的水罐，回到城里对人们说，这些人是她住在一起的人，这些人她是认识的。

来看吧，有一个男人告诉我你所有做过的事。这难道不是弥赛亚吗？于是他们从城里出来，往他那里去。就是这样。

那么我们该如何分析呢？**这意味着什么？首先，请注意，她并没有爬上讲台开始布道。**现在，站起来对一群人布道是可以的，我自己也会这样做。

And正如杰瑞·塞林格所说，这并没有什么不对。但她之所以这样做，并不是因为每个人都被呼召去做这样的事。耶稣呼召门徒的精髓并不是这样。另外请注意，她只去认识的人。

她不会去抓陌生人。当然，这也没什么不对。但这还不是重点。顺便提一下，无论你是谁，我们一会儿还会回到这一点上，但你现在已经能感觉到它的意义了。

她的性经历并不光彩。她不是社区里的道德模范。但在每个社区里，总有一条阶梯。即使是像我们美国人这样的平等社会，总是有等级之分的。

总有阶梯。你知道，在你的职业生涯中，总会有人比你高。有人比你低。有人比你年长，有人比你年轻。

有些人拥有更多。而你想要的东西别人却少于你。因此，无论你在梯子上的位置有多高，谈论你的信仰都是很可怕的。为什么呢？

因为你有很多要失去的。其他人会怎么说？你是狂热分子吗？如果你在梯子中间，这也不容易。

为什么呢？因为你不希望那些比你高的认为你有点……他们也希望……他们希望你能为他们打开门，让他们对你有好感。但即使你在梯子的底部，像她一样，你也想避免雪上加霜。也就是说，你不想别人说：“看，我们早就知道你是那种可疑的人物。

我们也知道你很疯狂。” 总是有东西要失去。但她去了，她说话了。而且…… 这一句话实际上可以分为两部分来告诉我们什么是公开信仰的精髓。

什么是耶稣呼召所有门徒去做的灵性推销。他说：“来看一个告诉我我一生中所做的一切的人。” 这两点公开信仰的基本要素很简单：一是简单的透明度。你看，她说的是什么？

> 他告诉我我所做的一切。现在，看，这... 她并没有列出一系列要点。这里没有太多神学内容。她不是在解释代赎的救赎。

她只是说，这就是发生了什么。她只是坦诚地讲述自己内心的状况。而这是你首先要理解的一点。基本上，公开信仰就是不隐藏自己的内心。

不隐藏生命之泉。不隐藏真实的自我。如果你不再隐藏，自然地与人分享你的决策过程，如何应对问题和压力，如果是一个基督徒，你就让人们了解你是谁，这样就变得很自然了。你看，你不一定跟任何人谈论这些事情，但一个人不必是亲密朋友也能分享三件事。

一是，你是否曾与他人讨论过你如何处理某个问题或生活中的压力？二是，你是否曾说过... 有没有人说最近我压力挺大的？我知道，我已经处理过了。三是，你是否曾与他人讨论过你的决策？

四是，你是否曾与他人分享过你的优先事项？现在，你可以与不是你最亲密的朋友交谈，但在了解对方的过程中，你会逐渐透露更多信息。当你到达那个阶段时，如果你是基督徒，并且不透露耶稣总是参与你解决问题和做决策的过程，你就切断了随着相互了解加深而自然产生的透明度。换句话说，公开信仰就是不要切断它，不要隐藏它。

你看，我们都知道人们不想听这些，尤其是在我们的文化中。但是重点在于，这是不自然的，是错误的。这是一种缺乏透明度的表现。所以你不需要去学习一堆要点，也不需要站在讲台上，只需要停止对自己的决定和处理问题进行虚假描述。

不要隐藏。不要隐藏。这就是第一个，个人的透明度。但第二个方面，请注意这一点。

她没有说要参加研讨会、读一本书，而是说要见一个人。我已经说过这一点了。她对耶稣的理解还不够深入。也就是说，她说他是救世主或者可能是救世主，好吧。

但她知道他会为她或我们而死吗？不。她知道他将从死里复活吗？这些都是非常重要的事情。

在这里，她显然没有太多神学知识。然而，不知怎么地，她抓住了基督教与所有宗教之间的本质区别。她实际上掌握了基督教的精髓。那是什么？

我认为，其他所有的宗教中，主要的东西就是“道路”。道路。例如，宗教的创始人、教师、先知、圣贤来到这里说：“这是五项支柱。”“这是通往觉悟的八正道。

” 换句话说，他们给人们提供了一条道路。他们会说：如果你想要找到上帝，如果你想要获得拯救，如果你想要与神圣相连，如果你想要开悟，如果你想要得到拯救，如果你想要获得上帝的恩宠，如果你想要与上帝建立关系，这里有一条路。你这样做，那样做，并思考它。佛教有一个非常明确的道路——四圣谛的最后一谛是八正道。

但是，你知道很多关于佛陀的知识对于这条道路是否有效真的重要吗？当然不。答案是你不需要知道太多关于佛陀的事情。为什么呢？

因为佛陀带来了这条路，但主要的是这条道路本身。有人可以触摸到那个带来它的人。主要的是，由于你们通过自己的努力让他们失去了上帝的恩典和与上帝的关系，所以关键在于方式。在于步骤。

在于计划。在于公式。这才是关键所在。不是创始人，也不是先知，而在基督教中完全不同。

在约翰福音14章，当有人对耶稣说：“主啊，你知道那条路。” 耶稣回答说：“我是道路。” 主啊，你有真理的话语。“我是真理。

” 我是道路。我是真理。他为什么这么说？难道他在自夸吗？

不是的。他说的是：我是道路意味着所有的宗教都告诉你如何找到上帝。我是来寻找你的上帝。所有的宗教都告诉你如何找到上帝。

我来是为了做你们自己做不到的事情，我来是要给你们作为礼物的救赎，你看。我们总是说福音改变了所有的一切，并且我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在《福音与生命》中八月是“去分享”月份的原因。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出一小步，向生活中上帝安排的人分享福音。

对于这个月向《福音与生命》捐款的朋友，我们将赠送两本《理解上帝》（Making Sense of God）一书，这是Tim Keller 的著作，是一份强大的资源，探讨了基督教如何在当今世界中从情感、文化以及理性方面来解释。这是我们对您礼物的感谢，并提供了一种通过阅读这本书与朋友分享福音的方式，或者送给同事，甚至将两本书传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人。这是一种开始或继续福音对话的简单方式。要获取您的两本《理解上帝》，只需访问福音与生命.com/捐赠。

再次，这是福音与生命.com/捐赠。现在，请听Dr. Keller 今天余下的教导。因此，其他所有宗教中的教师和创始人并不是关键所在。真正重要的不是你有多好，而是你要做好事，要走正道。

但在基督教里，一切都是关于耶稣。耶稣是你依靠的那位。他是唯一的道路。他是真理，是生命。

多年来，人们常常对我说这样的话，我经常听到有人说：“我很高兴你是基督徒，这很棒。” 但我相信所有好人最终都能上天堂。让我再重复一遍，这样你们就能听到并看到其中的错误假设。“我很高兴你是基督徒。

” 但我相信所有好人最终都能上天堂。这个假设是什么？假设是基督徒认为自己的好行为能让他们进入天堂，但实际上他们不应该这么狭隘地认为只有基督徒才是好的。但基督徒并不认为自己的好行为能让它们进入天堂。

事实上，基督教的精髓在于我们停止了依靠自己好行为的这种徒劳的努力。我们摆脱了依赖自己好行为所带来的疲惫感，而是依靠耶稣的好行为。**这意味着你不能谈论作为基督徒时内心的感受而不提到耶稣。**你无法避免这一点，必须指出他的美好，并指向他。

她就是这样理解的。这就是公开表达信仰的本质。只是要透明地说明你内心的状况，但你必须谈到、引用并指明耶稣。现在，这里是纽约市，你们中的许多人知道我刚才花费的18分钟对大多数纽约人来说是完全冒犯性的。

因为大多数纽约人都会说，你们基督徒可以相信你们所相信的一切，但你不应该试图改变别人。你不应该告诉人们基督教比他们的信仰更好或更真实，他们应该改变。你不应该试图说服别人。你不应该说你的信仰比他们的更好或更真实，并且他们应该改变。

你绝对不能这样做。你之前可能听过这样的说法。也许你就是这样认为的。我想给你两个理由来证明这种说法是完全错误的。

它绝对是个人上的错误，也是逻辑上的错误。首先从个人层面来说。人的内心不会那样运作。想象一下，一群家庭中每个家庭都有一位成员患有MS（多发性硬化症），这是一种非常可怕的疾病。

假想这些家庭的那位成员都在使用同一种药物进行治疗。结果发现，大多数家庭发现他们的MS患者得到了治愈。还有一些家庭发现，由于这种药物，病情有了显著改善。他们聚在一起交流心得、分享经验，并进行了研究，最终得出结论：这是治疗MS的方法。

世界需要看到这一点。于是他们成立了一个基金会，在各种平台上宣传这一消息。现在你会如何看待这些人？我认为你可能会想，他们可能是对的。

也可能是错的。但他们说这是治疗方法并没有什么狭隘之处。他们可能是对的。也可能错了。

但当然，如果他们认为自己找到了治疗方法，并且亲身经历了这一点，那么他们自然会这样做。也许你觉得其中有些人有点咄咄逼人，或许他们的态度有点强硬。但这并不妨碍他们的运动。他们想要向世界宣告这一消息是完全合理的。

好的，那为什么基督徒们就不能这样呢？其实他们并没有不同，只是更加如此。因为基督徒不仅仅相信自己找到了一种治疗疾病的疗法，他们相信自己找到了更为根本的东西。所以他们必须走向世界，说这是治疗方法。

因此你应当认为，他们可能是对的也可能是错的。其中有些人可能有点咄咄逼人。顺便提一句，很多基督徒确实有点咄咄逼人。但这并不是狭隘的表现。

这完全是自然而然的事情。最近在《大西洋月刊》上有一篇有趣的文章。这其实是一篇挺有意思的关于大学无神论者的文章。换句话说，这些人是在教会中长大的，上了大学之后变成了无神论者。

整篇文章都是在讨论他们。其中有这么一句话我想读给你们听。在这段话里引用了迈克尔的话——一个达特茅斯学院的多心理学专业的学生说：“如果一个人是基督徒，并且真的相信耶稣的那些说法，那么他认为自己找到了一种‘治愈’的方法，那迈克尔的意思就是：如果你是一个有道德的人，你就必须试图说服我。当然，他并不想让人觉得这是强加于人的。

” 为什么这么说呢？如果你是一个基督徒并且真的相信耶稣的说法，你认为你的信仰是正确的，那么迈克尔的意思是：如果一个人是有道德的，他就应该试图说服别人。当然，他并不是要人们粗鲁无礼。他只是在说，如果你相信这一点，那么你不尝试说服我，你就不是一个好人，因为你没有爱我，也没有相信它。

但这不只是说基督教徒可以信仰自己的宗教，但不应该试图说服别人。他们不应该说他们的信仰比别人的更好或更优越，让人们放弃自己的信仰来接受你的信仰。首先，我要亲自向你展示这并不合理；其次，从逻辑上来说也不成立。我会简短地说明一下，但从逻辑上来说，说你的精神现实观点比他人的更好是不合理的。

你知道吗？你说你的宗教观点比别人的好或重要，实际上就是在做你告诉别人他们不能做的事情。比如说，有几种方式可以表达这一点。如果你说没有人对灵性本质的信仰立场是优越的。

但你这么说本身就是一种信仰立场，你是无法用科学证明这一点的，而你在说这种观点是优越的。你是在说所有宗教都正确的观念比认为某个宗教错误的观念更优越。听我说，如果说一个宗教是对的是一种傲慢，那么为什么说关于宗教的观点正确也是一种傲慢呢？因为你其实想说的是：我认为所有宗教都是正确的这个想法比你认为只有你的宗教才是正确的更好。

**这意味着你自己认为你是对的。**我认为你应该相信我所信仰的东西，并且改变你的信仰。哎呀。你看，你无法避免做出真理声明。

排他性的真理声明。一说没有人应该做真理声明，那本身就是一种真理声明。一说没有人应该说你不应该说你的信念比我的更正确。但就在那一刻，你在说你的信念比我的更正确。

你是无法克服这一点的。现在，一旦意识到每个人都在做排他性真理声明，基督徒和其他人并没有什么不同。因此，每个人都对一些他们无法证明的东西有信心，并试图让别人相信他们的观点，因为他们认为如果世界是这样而不是那样会更好。每个人都在这样做。

好吧，我可以暂停一下说一句：你们中的一些人可能会正确地得出结论，在我一生中有过很多这样的对话，确实有过。让我告诉你，当你到达这种地方时——即某个人说，你知道的，基督徒不应该传教，也不应该公开他们的信仰，更不应该告诉别人他们错了。当我进入这种境地时，我说你正在做你告诉我不要做的事情，但他们说，不，我没有。然后你说，但你在再次这样做。

你在再次这样做。你在再次这样做。在某个时刻，他们会有点沮丧，并不是针对我，我想他们肯定不会。他们会说一些我非常能理解的话：“那我们怎么才能实现世界和平呢？

” 如果每个人都在那里说自己的宗教是正确的宗教，那么就会有暴力冲突。我们怎么能实现世界和平呢？没错，这就是问题所在。但让我问你们一件事。

实际上，我要用我的年龄来给你们一点提示。我已经足够老了，记得那些试图炸毁我们的敌人——共产主义者。他们就是那个试图炸毁我们的人。因此，他们是无神论者。

所以，无神论者是自由和民主的敌人。当然，宗教是自由和民主的朋友。这在我成长的那个50年代、60年代就是这样。但现在我们生活在一个时代，这个时代里，宗教极端分子正在试图炸毁我们。

没错吧？不再是无神论者了，而是宗教极端分子。所以现在大家说，自由和民主的敌人是宗教极端主义。当然，无神论现在看起来像是自由思想和自由。

我们能不能暂时脱离我们的文化背景，站出来，不要成熟起来，而是客观地思考一下？宗教并不是暴力的来源。无神论也不是暴力的来源。因为实际上，你有波尔布特、柬埔寨的大屠杀，是无神论者、共产主义者。

还有十字军东征。不，不，不。问题出在人性上。不是宗教或不信教或无神论的问题。

问题出在人性上。我可以告诉你们什么不会帮助改变人性。当你说不要做任何真理主张时，而你实际上却在这样做，这只会让人感到烦扰。如果你认为暴力来自人性，并且你认为解决办法是让每个人都保持私密，没有人说谁拥有真相——当然，这就是那个不切实际的真相主张，根本不起作用，只会让大家都感到沮丧。

那么我们怎么才能改变人性呢？### 三点。看看耶稣。看看祂的动机。

当然，耶稣是想引导这个女人从她的自然信仰转向新的信仰。但看看他是如何做的。**关键是，**真正的疑问不是**。****真正的疑问不是**。

我们怎么能阻止人们提出真理主张？因为你是做不到这一点的。**真正的疑问是**，谁的真理主张能引导更多人获得和平？或者谁的观点能让人们在与他们有深刻分歧的人身上表现出尊重、温柔和爱？

你听到了吗？让我们来看一下。首先，看看27节。就在这时，门徒回来了，惊讶地发现耶稣正在和一个女人说话。

但他们为什么会感到惊讶呢？你知道为什么吗？这是一个父权社会，在这种社会中，男人通常不会在公共场合与女人交谈。因为她们被认为地位低下。

这被认为是低人一等的行为。这也是一种种族主义的社会，在这种社会中，犹太人认为撒玛利亚人为半血种。第三，这是一个道德主义的社会。在一个道德主义的社会里，这里有一个拉比正在和一个曾经有过五段婚姻、现在与一个可能在中午来取水的男人同居的女人说话。

这个男人可能因为没有早上去取水而被视为社会边缘人。这里有个男人在和一个女人交谈。这里是个犹太人在和一个撒玛利亚人交谈。这里有个拉比正在和一个堕落的女人交谈。

这本来是不被允许的，但他却做了这件事。而且顺便说一句，一些评论家指出，井是一个搭讪的地方。而耶稣独自与这个女人在井边交谈，并且还与她交流。当门徒来的时候，他们感到非常惊讶。

顺便提一下，在叙述的早期部分，她自己也对这个人竟然会和她说话感到震惊。她在每一道社会界限上都处于不利地位。她是道德上的局外人、种族上的局外人。她是个女人，而不是男人。

她是撒玛利亚人，而不是犹太人。她是不道德的，而不是道德的。然而耶稣却与她交谈。为什么？

他不在乎别人怎么想。为什么？基本上有两种动机来告诉人们他们应该改变信仰。一种是骄傲。

我认为我是对的，你错了。爱是另一件事。我希望你们拥有我所拥有的，而耶稣基督充满了爱。这不是一个骄傲、自以为是的人会做的事。

所以如果他那样做，就不会和她说话了。因此，他在引导她走向永恒的生命，并试图改变她的信仰。但显然出于爱，我们如何做到这一点呢？如果你能敞开心扉地展示真实的自己，并能够公开表达你的信仰，那么你就会成为世界的一部分，对吧？

这就是**我们需要的。**不是那些隐藏自己的人，也不是那些以挑衅的方式说话、激怒别人的人。而是真实地展现自我，同时又尊重和温柔。我们如何做到这一点呢？

看看她是如何做到的。看第29节：“然后那妇人离开水罐，回到城里去，对众人说：‘你们来看一看，有一个人把我所做过的一切事都给我说了。’”请注意她的话。在小城镇里，大家都知道彼此的事情。

所以注意她在说什么。她不只是在说，天哪，他是不是通灵？不，不。你在说什么？

有个犹太拉比向我提供了生命之水，并且他知道我的一切。他说出了我做过的一切。你能想象她的朋友说：“他知道一切。” 是的，他知道关于哈利、彼得和乔的一切。

她说，“他看到了我最糟糕的一面。” 他看到了我最坏的时候，但他却给了我永恒的生命。你知道吗，这很奇怪。这里有个耶稣的拉比。

他向她提供了永恒的生命。记得那水是什么意思吗？他称之为能够让你永不渴的水。什么意思？

是灵魂的满足。他说，尽管你一直在错误的地方寻找它，我现在可以给你。> 然后那妇人离开水罐，回到城里去，对众人说：“你们来看一看，有一个人把我所做过的一切事都给我说了。” > 请注意她的话。

现在，作为一名犹太拉比，他为什么不说，亲爱的？我知道你心地善良，但你知道，你的表现一直很糟糕。也许你需要做的就是保持六周的清白，把事情做好，整顿一下自己，大约六周后回来再约一次。然后你们可能就准备好接受生命的活水了。

是的，那时你或许才配得上它。不，不，不，不，不，不。他看到了她的底细，依然伸出援手。你看，祂知道我做过的一切。

祂说：“我不在乎你的性经历。” 你知道耶稣为什么能做到这一点吗？祂可以免费向我们提供生命的活水，即使我们不配。因为在十字架上，祂说：“我渴了。

” 当祂在十字架上的时候，祂喊出的一句话是“我渴了”。难道只是口渴吗？可能不是。祂是在被神隔离，灵魂干枯。

祂正在经历我们因没有过应有的生活而应得的惩罚。但因为耶稣基督上了十字架，承担了我们的罪和我们应受的惩罚，当我们相信祂时，神可以接纳我们，并且免费赐给我们生命的活水。这就是恩典，这改变了你的身份。你知道我指的是什么吗？

社会学家说，事实上，一些社会理论家认为，每个人的身份都是基于差异建立的。也就是说，我感到自豪是因为我不像他们那样。我感到自豪是因为我不是她们、奴隶或异教徒。你记得那个犹太男人几百年前早上起床时念的祷告吗？

他说：“主啊，感谢祢没有让我成为奴隶、外邦人或女人。”这种自尊心是建立在“我不是女人”、“我不是奴隶”、“我不是外邦人”的基础上。那是什么？这就是一种基于差异的身份。

换句话说，我比你更好。而且老实说，即使通常不是那么明显，当有人说自己有传统价值观，而另一个人则说自己是进步的开明人士时；又有人称自己是宗教道德的人；还有人自认为是自由思想者。你总能感觉到他们背景中的一个共同点：我不像他们。如果你属于其他任何基督教派别，或者实际上认为自己是基督徒但对福音并不真正理解——这正是许多人的情况——你可能会相信与上帝的关系是因为你是好人、努力过、有道德。

因此，当你遇到不信神的人时，你可能会假设自己比他们更好。而你公开分享信仰的动机可能是骄傲和自大，只是喜欢告诉别人他们是错的。那么，你的救赎不是通过成就获得的吗？它不正是一种恩赐吗？

你的自我价值不是基于礼物吗？你的救赎不是因为你更优秀，而是因为你知道自己并不比任何人更好，需要极大的拯救？你知道，尽管你有糟糕的历史，上帝仍然爱你。这种新的身份感会改变你与人交谈的方式。

如果你知道你是因恩典得救的，而不是因为你更优秀或更有智慧，当你与一个不信的人、没有得救的人交谈时，你绝不会假设自己比他们更好，因为你不因自己的好而得救。他们可能更好。他们可能在某些方面更有智慧，在某些方面更能自我控制，可能是更好的丈夫、妻子、父亲或母亲。为什么不是呢？

因为你不是通过成为好父母、好配偶或有智慧的人来得救的。不，不，不。所有的优越感都消失了。你有了另一种身份感。

``` 因为你们有了不同的身份，因为你们看到耶稣为你们钉死在十字架上，因为你们看见他口渴时说“给我水喝”，你们就可以白白得着生命的活水。因此，你们成了问题的解决者。你们可以出于爱来谈论自己的信仰，但没有傲慢，没有自义。看看这个。

她能够对她说：“我不在乎你的性史。我不在乎你是否是黑帮的杀手。我可以给你这生命的活水，因为我口渴了。” 然后她回到朋友那里说：“他看到我最糟糕的一面却仍然爱我。

我从未遇到过像这样的男人。你们来看看这个人吧。” 他看到了我的底细，却仍然爱我到天边。要知道，她对基督教了解不多，而你和我知道得更多。

我们的借口是什么？让我们祷告。所以父啊，感谢你赐给我们永生。这生命之水通过耶稣基督的口渴、宇宙般的饥渴、他的死来到我们这里。

我们确实想成为问题的解决者。我们生活在一个多元的社会里。**我们需要很多知道如何分享自己的人——这些分享是令人安心的、尊重人的、充满爱的、勇敢的。**我们祷告，父啊，请使我们成为这样的人。

感谢你通过耶稣基督的恩典赐给我们这种能力，他来不是为了被服侍，而是来服侍，并且舍弃他的生命作为多人的赎价。奉他的名祷告。阿门。谢谢收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的讲道。
