## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

**Introduction:**

Welcome to Gospel in Life. During January, we're inviting our listeners to consider becoming a Gospel in Life monthly partner. If you'd like to learn more, keep listening at the end of today's podcast for details.

Have you ever wondered what it really means to live a great life? The Bible says the Ten Commandments aren't confining rules, but a framework for building a life of true greatness. Today, Tim Keller takes an in-depth look at one of the Ten Commandments and helps us understand what it means to live the way God designed us to, free, whole, and rooted in His love.

Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth. Fathers do not exasperate your children, instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.

This is the word of the Lord. Now my wife will be quick to tell you that when I approached this topic a couple weeks ago, I was unhappy about it. I said, I don't want to preach on this.

This is one of the great advantages of a series, it disciplines the preacher. I said, why do I want to preach on this? Maybe it was Mother's Day or Father's Day, but this is New York, and they don't have Mother's Day and Father's Day in New York.

It doesn't seem very interesting. Everybody knows about that command, right? I mean, it's pretty cut and dried.

What's there to say? And I think Kathy remembers that at the end of the day, I spent all day working on this, studying this one commandment, honor thy father and thy mother. And I worked on it all day on my son's bed.

I spread everything out on his bed. At the end of the day, she came on in and I looked up and I was amazed. I was amazed at what I'd learned.

I was amazed at how I'd been convicted and challenged. I was amazed at how I knew that I had changed. I changed.

And I felt like the psalmist who said, oh, thy commandment is exceeding broad, you see, and thy words are sweeter than honey to my mouth. Let me explain.

**引言：** 欢迎来到生命福音。在一月份，我们邀请听众考虑成为生命福音的月度伙伴。如果您想了解更多信息，请在今天的播客结束时继续收听。您是否曾经想过，真正伟大生活的意义是什么？

圣经说，十诫不是限制性的规则，而是构建真正伟大生活的框架。今天，提姆·凯勒深入探讨十诫之一，帮助我们理解按照上帝的设计生活意味着什么，自由、完整，并扎根于他的爱中。孩子们，要在主里听从父母，因为这是对的。要孝敬父母，这是第一条带应许的诫命，使你得福，并长寿在世上。

父亲们，不要惹儿女的气，只要照着主的教训和警戒养育他们。这是主的话。现在，我的妻子会很快告诉你，当我几周前接触这个话题时，我对此不满。我说，我不想讲这个。

这是系列讲道的一大优势，它约束了传道人。我说，我为什么要讲这个？也许是母亲节或父亲节，但这是纽约，他们在纽约没有母亲节和父亲节。这似乎不太有趣。

每个人都知道那条诫命，对吧？我的意思是，这很简单明了。有什么好说的？我想凯西记得那天结束时，我整天都在研究这条诫命，孝敬父母。

我整天都在我儿子的床上工作。我把所有东西都摊开在他的床上。那天结束时，她走进来，我抬头看着她，我很惊讶。我对我学到的东西感到惊讶。

我对我受到的触动和挑战感到惊讶。我对我知道我已经改变感到惊讶。我改变了。我觉得像诗篇作者说的，哦，你的诫命极其宽广，你的话语比蜜更甜。

让我解释一下。

## 格林童话：摧毁家庭的社会 / The Grimm's Fairy Tale: A Society That Destroys Family

**The Grimm's Fairy Tale:**

Have you ever heard a Grimm's fairy tale?

It's not a real famous one, but an intriguing one that is very, very relevant to our subject this morning. It was about a little old man who had gotten very, very, very senile. He got very confused about things and he was particularly messy at the supper table.

He was always dropping things and he was always splattering things all over himself. And he lived with his married son and his son's wife particularly hated the fact that he was so messy and so much of a nuisance. And over the months and years, she had really turned her son's, her husband's, she turned her husband against her father, his father in many ways.

And it convinced him that his father was a great nuisance. And his father really was a tremendous father. And his father was a tremendous burden.

One day, he was particularly messy in the supper, in the dining room. And the wife said, that does it. You're eating in the other room.

And she picked him up and they went into the other room and she sat him in the corner and she gave him the earthenware bowl. And for weeks and weeks, the little old man sat in that corner with his eyes blinking, not really sure what was going on, far away from everybody else, just eating his porridge. And one day, he dropped the earthenware bowl and he destroyed it.

And the daughter-in-law, the wife, was very furious. And she came in and she says, that does it. If you're going to eat like a pig, you might as well eat like a pig.

And she grabbed a trough out of the pigsty, and this was a farm, and she brought it in and she put it down in front of him and says, from now on, you can eat out of this. And that's how she served him. And it was some weeks later that the father and the mother, the husband and the wife, son and daughter-in-law, saw their little boy carving something.

And they said, what are you working on? And the fairy tale goes like this, he looks up and he says, very proudly, he says, I am carving you and daddy a trough so that when you grow up, when I grow up and you get old, I can feed you out of it. And the son and daughter-in-law looked at each other and they said nothing.

And they began to weep. And suddenly the son, the son-in-law, I mean the son of the adult son, his memory began to go back. He began to think and he began to think and work overtime and began to smolder.

And what happened was that the son and daughter-in-law walked on in and picked the old man up by the hand and led him back into the dining room and sat him down in the most comfortable chair and let him eat there and never, ever, ever got angry at him again. That's a fairy tale. You know, it's a good fairy tale.

But its point is, it sums up the fifth commandment. And what is that? The fifth commandment teaches this, a society that destroys the family destroys itself.

The fifth commandment is this, if you eliminate honor in the family, you will eliminate honor, period. And what amazes me over the years is I have preached on this commandment four times before. Obviously, I must have preached at least four other series on the Ten Commandments.

Every time I addressed the commandment to parents, every time I preached a sermon on it, I would get to that place and I would talk about what Christian family life ought to be like. But if you read the commandment, you see it does not address parents at all. It says, honor thy father and thy mother.

It's talking to children and particularly it's talking to adult children. And what's intriguing about the Ten Commandments is you have to realize that the Ten Commandments are a summary of everything that human beings ought to be. We're saying all along that the Ten Commandments are like a high, are high steel.

When you think about a skyscraper going up, you see the high steel and then on top of it, after they put the steel framework up there, they build the skyscraper on it. And we've said that the Ten Commandments are like high steel on which you can build a life of greatness and a society of greatness. And yet in all of the Ten Commandments, there's no place that talks about how Christians should relate to the state or Christians should relate to the government or how people should relate to their people above them.

It doesn't talk about authority except right here. And I think it's because God knows that if we honor our parents, all kinds of other things will fall into place. Now, you say it's awfully cut and dried.

I know we're supposed to honor our parents, but let's look into it a little bit deeper and let's ask the commandment three questions, what, why, and how. And let's just blip right through, what does this commandment tell us, why does this commandment tell us, and how can we go about obeying it? What, why, and how?

What should we do? Why should we do it, and how can we do it? All right?

Let's take a look.

**格林童话：** 你听说过格林童话吗？这不是一个非常有名的故事，但却是一个非常非常与我们今天早上主题相关的引人入胜的故事。它讲述了一个小老头，他变得非常非常非常年老糊涂。

他对事物非常困惑，尤其是在餐桌上特别邋遢。他总是掉东西，总是把东西溅得到处都是。他和他已婚的儿子住在一起，他儿子的妻子特别讨厌他如此邋遢，如此麻烦。经过几个月和几年，她在许多方面真的让她的丈夫对她的父亲产生了反感，并让他相信他的父亲是一个很大的麻烦。

他的父亲确实是一个了不起的父亲。他的父亲是一个巨大的负担。有一天，他在餐厅特别邋遢。妻子说，这就够了。

你去另一个房间吃饭。她把他扶起来，他们走进另一个房间，她让他坐在角落里，给他一个陶碗。几个星期，小老头坐在那个角落里，眼睛眨巴着，不太清楚发生了什么，远离其他人，只是吃他的粥。一天，他打破了陶碗，把它摔坏了。

儿媳妇，妻子，非常生气。她走进来，她说，这就够了。如果你要像猪一样吃饭，你就像猪一样吃饭。她从猪圈里抓出一个槽，这是一个农场，她把它带进来，放在他面前说，从现在开始，你可以从这里吃。

她就是这样伺候他的。几个星期后，父亲和母亲，丈夫和妻子，儿子和儿媳，看见他们的小男孩在雕刻东西。他们说，你在做什么？童话是这样的，他自豪地抬起头来说，我正在为你和爸爸雕刻一个槽，这样当我长大而你们变老时，我可以用它来喂你们。

儿子和儿媳互相看着，他们什么也没说。他们开始哭泣。突然，儿子，儿媳的儿子，我是说成年儿子的儿子，他的记忆开始回溯。他开始思考，他开始思考并加班工作，开始发怒。

结果是，儿子和儿媳走进去，牵着老人的手，把他带回餐厅，让他坐在最舒适的椅子上，让他在那里吃饭，再也没有对他生气过。这是一个童话。你知道，这是一个好童话。但它的重点是，它总结了第五诫。

那是什么？第五诫教导我们，一个摧毁家庭的社会就是在自我毁灭。第五诫是这样的，如果你消除家庭中的尊重，你将消除所有的尊重。让我惊讶的是，多年来我已经四次讲过这条诫命。

显然，我至少讲过四次关于十诫的系列讲道。每次我讲到对父母的诫命，每次我讲到这条诫命，我都会讲到基督徒家庭生活应该是什么样的。但如果你阅读这条诫命，你会发现它根本没有提到父母。它说，孝敬父母。

它是在对孩子们说话，特别是对成年子女说话。十诫的有趣之处在于，你必须意识到十诫是对人类应该成为的一切的总结。我们一直在说，十诫就像高钢。当你想到一座摩天大楼升起时，你会看到高钢，然后在上面，他们把钢框架放在那里，他们在上面建造摩天大楼。

我们说，十诫就像高钢，你可以在上面建造一个伟大的生活和一个伟大的社会。然而，在所有的十诫中，没有一个地方谈到基督徒应该如何与国家相处，或者基督徒应该如何与政府相处，或者人们应该如何与他们之上的人相处。除了这里，它没有谈到权威。我想这是因为上帝知道，如果我们尊重父母，其他许多事情都会顺理成章。

现在，你说这非常简单明了。我知道我们应该尊重父母，但让我们深入一点，让我们问这条诫命三个问题，是什么，为什么，以及如何。让我们快速浏览一下，这条诫命告诉我们什么，为什么这条诫命告诉我们，以及我们如何去遵守它？是什么，为什么，以及如何？

我们应该做什么？为什么我们应该这样做，以及我们如何做到？好吧？让我们看看。

## 孝敬的真正含义 / What Does It Mean to Honor?

**What Does It Mean to Honor?**

Number one, what does this commandment ask for? Think.

It is absolutely stubborn, it's absolutely single-minded, it commands honor. Notice what it does not command. This text does not command affection.

Now, that doesn't mean that affection isn't appropriate, but it doesn't command that you have affection for, that you confide in, or that you even trust your parents. Number two, it does not command admiration. It doesn't command that you think that they're the greatest thing.

Number three, it does not command obedience. It does not command that you always do what they wish. But it always commands honor.

Now, why? The reason it commands honor, and not these other things, is because the relationship between a child and a parent is incredibly complex. It changes.

In the earliest stages, we must be totally dependent on our parents, and we must obey them. It says so. In fact, this passage in Ephesians says, children, obey your parents.

But the word children there means little children. And we know the Bible says that at a certain stage, we should leave our parents. That means we no longer obey them.

We're supposed to be raised up. We're supposed to become adults. In fact, to continue to depend on your parents and to continue to be intimate with your parents into adulthood can be very pathological.

So you see, things change, and obedience is not always something that's good. Dependence is not always something which is good. Another thing that can differ is your parents themselves.

Some parents are quite admirable people. Some parents are downright evil. And for you to obey them, or for you to even trust them, or for you to try to admire them would be to live a lie, and would be very unwise.

But you see, the command is so wise because it doesn't say you must love your parents in the sense of admiring them or having deep affection for them. In some cases, yes. In some times, yes.

But the one thing you must always, always, always give them, no matter what age you are, no matter what condition they are in, no matter what kind of person you are, no matter what kind of people they are, is honor. The Bible says that there's no excuse under any condition for you not to honor your parents. And do you realize how important that is to separate honor from all these other things?

A lot of us are thinking, well, if I continue to honor my parents, that means I have to obey them. And I shouldn't. And since I just shouldn't obey them, why do I have to honor them?

Your conscience tells you that you don't have to obey them, but your conscience does tell you that you have to honor them. And you've got to separate these out or you'll never be able to really honor your conscience or this law. Honor your father and your mother.

That's what it asks for. Nothing more and nothing less. That's the what.

Now, why does it command this? And that's interesting. You see, some cultures and some traditions and some religions will say you should honor your father and your mother because of the mystery of the blood.

You know what the mystery of the blood is? Because you should be so awed in the presence of the one out of whom loins you spring. You see, there's something mysterious and awesome.

But that's not what the Bible talks about because, you know, the Bible considers that an adopted father or mother is just as worthy of honor as a natural one. Some people say, well, the reason that you need to honor your father and your mother is because they're wiser than you because they're older than you. And we all know that's not necessarily true.

The Bible doesn't teach that the older you are, the wiser you get. The Bible teaches that the more mature in Christ you are, the wiser you get. And therefore, the fact is that parents are sinners and children are sinners, the Bible says, and so you can't just say because we should honor parents because parents are less sinful.

That's just, that's not what it says. In fact, some people would say, well, the reason you must honor your parents is because you should honor your parents out of gratitude for what they've done. The fact is that there are situations in which there's very little gratitude owed because there was very little given.

And yet the word honor is there for everybody.

**什么是孝敬？** 第一，这条诫命要求什么？想想。它绝对固执，绝对专一，它命令尊重。

注意它没有命令什么。这段经文没有命令感情。这并不意味着感情不合适，但它没有命令你对父母有感情，信任他们，甚至依赖他们。第二，它没有命令钦佩。

它没有命令你认为他们是最伟大的。第三，它没有命令服从。它没有命令你总是做他们希望的事情。但它总是命令尊重。

现在，为什么？它命令尊重而不是其他这些东西的原因是，因为孩子和父母之间的关系极其复杂。它会改变。在最早的阶段，我们必须完全依赖父母，我们必须服从他们。

事实上，这段以弗所书的经文说，孩子们，要听从父母。但这里的孩子们这个词是指小孩子。我们知道圣经说，在某个阶段，我们应该离开父母。**这意味着我们不再服从他们。**

我们应该被养育长大，成为成年人。事实上，继续依赖父母并在成年后与父母保持亲密关系可能是非常病态的。所以你看，事情会改变，服从并不总是好的。依赖并不总是好的。

另一个可能不同的是你的父母本身。有些父母是相当令人钦佩的人。有些父母是彻头彻尾的邪恶。让你服从他们，甚至信任他们，或者试图钦佩他们将是生活在谎言中，并且非常不明智。

但你看，这条诫命是如此明智，因为它没有说你必须爱你的父母，意思是钦佩他们或对他们有深厚的感情。在某些情况下，是的。在某些时候，是的。但无论你多大年龄，无论他们处于什么状态，无论你是什么样的人，无论他们是什么样的人，你必须始终始终始终给予他们的是尊重。

圣经说，在任何情况下，你都没有理由不尊重你的父母。你意识到将尊重与所有这些其他事情分开的重要性吗？我们中的许多人在想，好吧，如果我继续尊重我的父母，那意味着我必须服从他们。而我不应该。

因为我不应该服从他们，为什么我必须尊重他们？你的良心告诉你，你不必服从他们，但你的良心确实告诉你，你必须尊重他们。你必须将这些分开，否则你将永远无法真正尊重你的良心或这条法律。尊重你的父亲和母亲。

这就是它要求的。没有更多也没有更少。这是“是什么”。现在，为什么它命令这个？

这很有趣。你看，一些文化和一些传统和一些宗教会说你应该尊重你的父亲和母亲，因为血缘的神秘。你知道血缘的神秘是什么吗？因为你应该在你所出的父母面前感到敬畏。

你看，有一些神秘和令人敬畏的东西。但这不是圣经所谈论的，因为你知道，圣经认为一个养父或养母和一个亲生父母一样值得尊重。有些人会说，你需要尊重你的父亲和母亲的原因是因为他们比你更聪明，因为他们比你年长。我们都知道这不一定是真的。

圣经没有教导说你越老越聪明。圣经教导说你在基督里越成熟，你就越聪明。因此，事实上，圣经说父母是罪人，孩子是罪人，所以你不能仅仅因为我们应该尊重父母，因为父母更少罪恶。这只是，这不是它所说的。

事实上，有些人会说，你必须尊重你的父母的原因是因为你应该出于对他们所做的事情的感激而尊重你的父母。事实是，有些情况下，几乎没有感激之情，因为几乎没有给予。然而，尊重这个词对每个人都是如此。

## 为何孝敬：父母是神的道德代表 / Why Honor: Parents as God's Moral Representatives

**Why Honor - Parents as Representatives of God's Moral Order:**

So the real question is, why do it? And the answer is right here, actually.

Honor your father and your mother, look, for this is right. For this is right. What's that getting at?

Something very profound. Give me about three minutes to develop it, all right? There's a moral structure in the universe.

There's a moral order to things. There's a right and there's a wrong. And there's a God who created us.

And when we listen to his word and we come under his authority and we say, yes, I believe what you say about me, and we listen to what he does, what he says, we experience the liberty of authority. Now, there are lots of little illustrations you can give here on earth. When a bunch of musicians get together and they follow a conductor, they're going to experience the liberty of authority.

In other words, if they all do what the conductor says, they may have a symphony on their hands. If a bunch of people get together to play a game, whether it's basketball or football or whatever, you've got to have a ref. And if they don't listen to the referee and if every single person there says, well, I want to play by my own rules, there's not going to be a game.

But if they listen to the ref, there may be a game. If they listen to the conductor, there may be a symphony. And you may not like the referee or think he's doing a good job.

And you may not like the conductor and think that he or she is doing a good job. But you do know this, you've got to have one. And you give respect to the person in authority knowing that even if that person's not doing a good job, it would be far worse if there was no one there because there's got to be somebody there.

Because there's a moral structure to things. And some things like music, some things like sports, most things don't happen unless you put yourself under someone's authority. The Bible says there's a moral order for life and God is our creator and he tells us what is right and wrong.

But the first incarnation of that moral order, the first representative that we have of that moral order in the universe is your parents. And that moral order is a teaching authority. Now let me explain that.

**为什么孝敬——父母作为神道德秩序的代表：** 所以**真正的问题是**，为什么要这样做？

答案就在这里，实际上。尊重你的父亲和母亲，看，因为这是对的。因为这是对的。这是什么意思？

非常深刻的东西。给我大约三分钟来发展它，好吗？宇宙中有一个道德结构。事情有一个道德秩序。

有对与错。有一个创造我们的上帝。当我们听从他的话语，服从他的权威，说，是的，我相信你对我的看法，并听从他的所作所为时，我们体验到权威的自由。现在，这里有很多小例子可以在地球上给出。

当一群音乐家聚在一起并听从指挥时，他们将体验到权威的自由。换句话说，如果他们都按照指挥的说法去做，他们可能会有一场交响乐。如果一群人聚在一起玩游戏，无论是篮球还是足球或其他，你必须有一个裁判。如果他们不听裁判的话，如果每个人都说，好吧，我想按照自己的规则玩，就不会有游戏。

但如果他们听从裁判，可能会有游戏。如果他们听从指挥，可能会有交响乐。你可能不喜欢裁判或认为他做得不好。你可能不喜欢指挥，认为他或她做得不好。

但你知道这一点，你必须有一个。你尊重权威者，知道即使那个人做得不好，如果没有人在那里会更糟糕，因为必须有人在那里。因为事情有一个道德结构。像音乐这样的东西，像运动这样的东西，大多数事情都不会发生，除非你把自己置于某人的权威之下。

圣经说，生活有一个道德秩序，上帝是我们的创造者，他告诉我们什么是对的和错的。但这种道德秩序的第一个体现，这种道德秩序的第一个代表是你的父母。那种道德秩序是一种教学权威。让我解释一下。

## 家庭：非专制亦非放任 / The Family: Neither Authoritarian Nor Permissive

Over the last few years, there's been a revolution in the modern understanding of the family. The old understanding of the family was completely authoritarian where fathers in particular, fathers had the right to kill their children if they wanted to. They had that kind of authority.

But over the last 150 years, the authoritarian model is going by the boards and I'll tell you one of the reasons why. There's lots of reasons. There's ideological reasons.

In the East, totalitarianism has weakened the family so that the state can have more control over the child. But in the West, individualism has weakened the family because in the West, we believe so strongly that you should never sacrifice for anybody but you should always seek to fulfill yourself first. You've got to look out for number one.

You've got to take responsibility for yourself. You know all the cliches. And the most important thing is to find yourself and a parent should not put the child's welfare over his or her own.

And the child should not put the parent's authority over his or her welfare. And so that's undermined. But frankly, the biggest reason that the old authoritarian understanding of marriage has been undermined is the Industrial Revolution which happened 150 years ago.

If you read the Bible, you will see that the father and the mother, the husband and the wife were co-heirs of both the economic provision of the family and the rearing of the children. The father and the mother worked together to provide for the family. Whether they were farmers, whether they were craftsmen, they did it together.

And the father and the mother together reared the children. But what happened somewhere 150 years ago, because of the way in which industrialization proceeded in our society, the husband got to the place where he left to go work. And the wife stayed home with the children.

And then this unbiblical bifurcation happened, and that was that career and money-making work was man's work, and taking care of the children was women's work. Now what happened was that on the one hand, men became alienated from child-rearing. They became incompetent at it, totally incompetent at it.

Meanwhile, women became embittered by it, because they were bearing the whole brunt on themselves. And so in the last 20 years, we see that in the wisdom of the human soul, women have decided in order to be equal, we're going to be equally alienated from child-rearing. In order to be equal, what we're going to do is not call the husbands back, but to say career-first.

We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life. Good things that can easily become ultimate things. When we put our faith in them, deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings.

The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need. In his book, Counterfeit Gods, The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power and the Only Hope That Matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals and our own hearts, and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires. This month, we'll send you Counterfeit Gods as our thank you for your gift to help Gospel & Life share the love of Christ with people all over the world.

You can request your copy at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. And now recently, the Carnegie Foundation came out with this remarkable study on the family. And it says, no longer is the family the place where a child is reared.

The family is only a place, that foundation said, for creating warmth and encouragement, emotional nurture in the sense of just support. And that study said this, if I can paraphrase it, I can't quote it. The study said that parents are no longer craftsmen, but they are more like executives.

They are executives over a whole plant in which they try to make sure that all the processes are coordinated to come out with the final product. In other words, parents do not rear their children, but they take them to the child development expert, and they take them to the child psychologist, and they take them to the teacher, and they take them to all the people, and the child works out what he or she wants to become along with the experts. And it's just the parent's job to support that.

So the authoritarian model has been jettisoned for the warm fuzzy model, that the family is not a place where we tell the children what they should be, but it's a place where we just simply emotionally support them. The Bible will have neither of those. And it doesn't.

Right here it says, fathers, bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And look at that. Look at that balance.

First of all, there's authority, because nurture and admonition mean teach your children what is right. But the word bring them up is very important, because the whole purpose of teaching your child is not to make them more controlled by you, but to get them up. To bring them up, raise them up means make them independent.

Bring them to the place of critical freedom, to where the child can make his or her own decisions and gets out from under. The very second you begin to teach your child, you're trying to get ready to have that child not need you. And that is the kind of servant authority the Bible says that the family ought to have.

And herein is what the Bible says a parent's authority really is. A parent is called to be a representative of God's teaching authority. A parent's job is to say to their children, this is what's right, this is what's good, this is what's valuable.

And what makes a parent effective is not whether or not he or she is right, but whether or not he or she takes up the office God called the parents to. And most parents intrinsically have always known that it's their job to pass along their values. And a good parent is somebody who does it.

And what destroys a child's respect for the parent is not whether or not the parent is wise or smart or profound or orthodox. What really destroys a child's respect for a parent is if the parent doesn't believe what he or she says and doesn't do any teaching at all. And the experts will tell you misdirected authority is nowhere near as devastating as no authority.

For a parent to simply say, I don't know what's right and wrong and who knows and you can make up your own mind, is much more devastating to a child than to be told the wrong thing. And that's the reason why Emil Durkheim, the famous sociologist, says that if you give children the wrong kind of authority, at least they'll grow up and they'll say that was wrong, that was stupid, I'm going to find the right kind of right and wrong. But if you give the children no teaching authority at all, the children grow up not believing there is right and wrong and so they can never get to the place of critical freedom.

Because they're never in a position to be able to discern good from bad, wise from foolish, you see. And they die for a famine of authority.

近年来，现代家庭观念发生了一场革命。旧的家庭观念是完全专制的，特别是父亲，父亲有权杀死他们的孩子，如果他们愿意的话。他们有那种权威。但在过去的150年里，专制模式正在消失，我会告诉你其中一个原因。

有很多原因。有意识形态的原因。在东方，极权主义削弱了家庭，以便国家可以对孩子有更多的控制。但在西方，个人主义削弱了家庭，因为在西方，我们非常相信你不应该为任何人牺牲，但你应该始终首先寻求实现自我。

你必须为自己着想。你必须对自己负责。你知道所有的陈词滥调。最重要的是找到自己，父母不应该把孩子的福利放在他或她自己的上面。

孩子不应该把父母的权威放在他或她的福利之上。因此，这削弱了。但坦率地说，旧的专制婚姻观念被削弱的最大原因是150年前的工业革命。如果你阅读圣经，你会看到父亲和母亲，丈夫和妻子是家庭经济供给和孩子抚养的共同继承人。

父亲和母亲一起工作来养家。不管他们是农民，还是工匠，他们都是一起做的。父亲和母亲一起抚养孩子。但150年前的某个时候，由于我们社会工业化的方式，丈夫到了离开去工作的地步。

妻子留在家里照顾孩子。然后发生了这种不符合圣经的分裂，那就是职业和赚钱的工作是男人的工作，照顾孩子是女人的工作。现在发生的是，一方面，男人与抚养孩子疏远了。他们在这方面变得完全无能。

而与此同时，女人对此感到痛苦，因为她们自己承担了全部负担。所以在过去的20年里，我们看到在人类灵魂的智慧中，女人决定为了平等，我们将同样疏远于抚养孩子。为了平等，我们要做的是不召回丈夫，而是说职业优先。我们都追逐诸如成功、真爱或完美生活之类的东西。

好东西很容易成为终极的东西。当我们把信仰放在它们上面时，内心深处，我们知道它们无法满足我们最深的渴望。事实是，我们把好东西变成了较小的神，无法给予我们真正需要的东西。在他的书《假神：金钱、性与权力的空承诺以及唯一重要的希望》中，提姆·凯勒向我们展示了如何正确理解圣经揭示了社会理想和我们自己内心的真相，并向我们展示只有一位神可以完全满足我们的愿望。

本月，我们将把《假神》作为我们对您帮助生命福音与世界各地的人分享基督之爱的礼物的感谢。您可以在gospelandlife.com/give请求您的副本。那是gospelandlife.com/give.现在，这里是凯勒博士，继续今天的教学。最近，卡内基基金会发表了一项关于家庭的显著研究。

它说，家庭不再是抚养孩子的地方。家庭只是一个创造温暖和鼓励、情感滋养的地方。该研究这样说，如果我可以转述，我不能引用。研究说，父母不再是工匠，而更像是高管。

他们是整个工厂的高管，他们试图确保所有过程协调，以得出最终产品。换句话说，父母不抚养孩子，而是带他们去儿童发展专家，带他们去儿童心理学家，带他们去老师，带他们去所有的人，孩子与专家一起决定他或她想成为什么。父母的工作只是支持这一点。因此，专制模式被抛弃，取而代之的是温暖的模糊模式，家庭不是一个告诉孩子他们应该成为什么的地方，而只是一个情感支持他们的地方。

圣经既不接受这两者。它没有。在这里，它说，父亲们，要按照主的教训和警戒养育他们。看看这个。

看看这个平衡。首先，有权威，因为教养和警戒意味着教导你的孩子什么是对的。但“养育他们”这个词非常重要，因为教导孩子的整个目的是不是让他们更受你控制，而是让他们成长。养育他们，养育他们意味着让他们独立。

把他们带到批判性自由的地方，让孩子可以做出自己的决定，并摆脱束缚。你开始教导孩子的那一刻，你就试图让孩子不再需要你。这就是圣经所说的家庭应该有的仆人权威。圣经在这里说，父母的权威真正是什么。

父母被召唤成为上帝教学权威的代表。父母的工作是对孩子说，这是什么是对的，这是什么是好的，这是什么是有价值的。使父母有效的不是他或她是否正确，而是他或她是否承担了上帝召唤父母的职责。大多数父母本能地一直知道，他们的工作是传递他们的价值观。

一个好父母是这样做的人。真正破坏孩子对父母的尊重的，不是父母是否聪明、聪明、深刻或正统。真正破坏孩子对父母的尊重的是，如果父母不相信他或她所说的，并且根本没有进行任何教学。专家会告诉你，错误的权威远没有没有权威那么具有破坏性。

父母简单地说，我不知道什么是对的和错的，谁知道，你可以自己决定，这对孩子来说比被告知错误的事情更具破坏性。这就是为什么著名社会学家埃米尔·涂尔干说，如果你给孩子错误的权威，至少他们会长大后说那是错的，那是愚蠢的，我要找到正确的对与错。但如果你根本不给孩子任何教学权威，孩子们长大后不相信有对与错，因此他们永远无法达到批判性自由的地步。因为他们从未处于能够分辨好坏、明智与愚蠢的地位。

因为他们因权威的饥荒而死。

## 如何孝敬：认真对待与饶恕 / How to Honor: Take Them Seriously and Forgive

**How to Honor Your Parents:**

Why do you have to know this to honor your parents?

You have to know this because look at your parents. Most of you are adults. Look at your parents in your mind.

Did your parents give you bad advice? Did they tell you things that now you believe are just wrong? You need to honor them for the fact that they picked up their office and they discharged it.

There's nothing that says anywhere that all parents, in order to honor God, have got to be right all the time about what is right and wrong. But the office is you've got to teach your children. Did your parents teach you the wrong things?

At least they taught you. But secondly, what if your parents really booted the ball badly? What if they were the kind of parents that really completely, completely failed in their office?

They never saw you. They were never with you. Then you still honor them.

Why? Because of what they represent. The fact is that they were God with you.

The fact is they were the first representation of God in your life. And though they did a lousy job at it, you give them, what, respect because of what lies behind them, which is the throne of God itself. You just remember that Grimm's fairy tale and you remember that no matter how bad things are, you have got to see that if we don't honor our parents, there's no honor in the society.

If we don't honor that kind of community, there's no community possible. And therefore, you must honor your parents. Now the last issue, remember, what, why?

What do we have to do? We have to honor them. Why do we have to do it?

Because they're God's first representatives of his moral order in your life. Because they represent him. Third, how can we do it?

How can we do it? Let me be specific. I'm going to tell you there's three things you've got to do to honor your parents.

Number one, you've got to take them seriously. Number two, you've got to forgive them. And number three, you've got to make sure that you're a son or a daughter of the real Father, the one in heaven.

All three. Now listen. Number one, take your father and mother seriously.

The word kibboth is the word for honor. One of my favorite words in the Hebrew, when it says honor your father and your mother, it says kibbeth them. And the word kibboth means wait.

It means treat them, not lightly, but as significant. And that's the important thing. You don't have to necessarily do what they say.

You don't necessarily have to think that they're marvelous. You don't necessarily have to confide all your problems to them. But you do have to treat them as if they are not insignificant.

You cannot treat them flippantly. You have to take them seriously. Now there's lots of ways to do that.

One, of course, is through all the familiar symbols, by giving them the place of honor at the table, by remembering their anniversaries and remembering things like that. By asking them for their opinion and listening to it seriously, even if you're not sure you're going to take their opinion, even if you're not sure you're going to take their advice. Familiar symbols.

Another way to take them seriously, and listen to this, honor the fact that they need to see themselves in you. You know, I'm only beginning to realize now that when one of my sons gets some kind of award, for some reason I feel awarded. And when one of my sons gets a citation for bad behavior, in some way I feel that I have been dishonored.

It's a strange feeling. And I realize now why the Bible often says, your children are your image. You know, I always wonder when I'm walking around the subway stations, since there's so many New York personalities that are famous that actually, you know, walk around New York, and they must see these billboards of themselves up on, down in the subways or up on the walls, and they must see how people have defaced them and made them look stupid.

You know, putting on mustaches and weird things like that. I mean, it must seem, when you put your image up there like that, you are vulnerable. Somebody can make you look like a jerk, and when you go by, you know, in your limousine and you look at it, you must feel like a jerk.

But it's a lot worse. It's a lot worse when your children do things that you disapprove of. You feel that they're making you look ugly.

And it gets hard when you've adopted a very different set of values than your parents have. Very difficult. But what you must do, one of the ways to honor your parents is to point out to them things that you have learned from them.

Point out things that are continuous. Things in you, good things in you that you can attribute to them. It doesn't take much.

Sometimes it's getting on the phone and saying, you know, one thing I've always learned from you and I still do it, and that's all it can take. That honors their need to see themselves in you. It's natural.

You're their image. There's so many ways. Take them seriously, number one.

**如何孝敬父母：** 为什么你需要知道这一点来尊重你的父母？你需要知道这一点，因为看看你的父母。你们大多数人都是成年人。

在你的脑海中看看你的父母。你的父母给了你坏建议吗？他们告诉你一些你现在认为是错误的事情吗？你需要尊重他们，因为他们承担了他们的职责并履行了它。

没有任何地方说，所有父母为了尊重上帝，必须在什么是对与错上总是正确的。但职责是你必须教导你的孩子。你的父母教了你错误的事情吗？至少他们教了你。

但其次，如果你的父母真的把球踢得很糟糕怎么办？如果他们是那种完全失败的父母怎么办？他们从未见过你。他们从未和你在一起。

那么你仍然尊重他们。为什么？因为他们代表的是什么。事实是，他们是与你同在的上帝。

事实是，他们是你生命中上帝的第一个代表。虽然他们做得很糟糕，但你给予他们，什么，尊重，因为他们背后是什么，那就是上帝的宝座本身。你只需记住那个格林童话，并记住无论情况多么糟糕，你必须看到如果我们不尊重我们的父母，社会就没有尊重。如果我们不尊重那种社区，就没有可能的社区。

因此，你必须尊重你的父母。现在最后一个问题，记住，是什么，为什么？我们必须做什么？我们必须尊重他们。

为什么我们必须这样做？因为他们是上帝在你生命中道德秩序的第一个代表。因为他们代表他。第三，我们如何做到这一点？

我们如何做到这一点？让我具体一点。我会告诉你有三件事你必须做来尊重你的父母。第一，你必须认真对待他们。

第二，你必须原谅他们。第三，你必须确保你是天上真正父亲的儿子或女儿。所有三个。现在听着。

第一，认真对待你的父亲和母亲。kibboth这个词是尊重的词。当它说尊重你的父亲和母亲时，它说kibbeth他们。kibboth这个词的意思是重量。

它的意思是对待他们，而不是轻视，而是作为重要的。这是重要的事情。你不必一定要做他们说的事情。你不一定要认为他们是了不起的。

你不一定要向他们倾诉你所有的问题。但你必须对待他们，好像他们不是无关紧要的。你不能轻率地对待他们。你必须认真对待他们。

现在有很多方法可以做到这一点。当然，通过所有熟悉的象征，通过给他们在桌子上的尊贵位置，记住他们的纪念日和记住这样的事情。通过询问他们的意见并认真听取，即使你不确定你会接受他们的意见，即使你不确定你会接受他们的建议。熟悉的象征。

另一种认真对待他们的方法，听着，尊重他们需要在你身上看到自己的事实。你知道，我现在才开始意识到，当我的一个儿子获得某种奖项时，我感到自己也获得了奖项。当我的一个儿子因为不良行为而被处罚时，我在某种程度上感到自己受到了侮辱。这是一种奇怪的感觉。

我现在意识到为什么圣经经常说，你的孩子是你的形象。你知道，我总是想知道，当我在地铁站走来走去时，因为有那么多纽约的名人实际上在纽约走来走去，他们一定看到这些广告牌上有他们自己的形象，在地铁或墙上，他们一定看到人们如何对待他们，让他们看起来很愚蠢。你知道，给他们画上胡子和奇怪的东西。我的意思是，当你把你的形象放在那里时，你是脆弱的。

有人可以让你看起来像个傻瓜，当你经过时，你知道，在你的豪华轿车里，你看着它，你一定感到像个傻瓜。但这要糟糕得多。当你的孩子做一些你不赞成的事情时，你觉得他们让你看起来很丑。当你采用了与你父母非常不同的价值观时，这变得很困难。

但你必须做的是，尊重你的父母的一种方法是指出你从他们那里学到的东西。指出在你身上与他们连续的东西。你可以归因于他们的好东西。有时只需打个电话说，你知道，我一直从你那里学到的一件事，我仍然这样做，这就是全部。

这尊重了他们在你身上看到自己的需要。这是自然的。你是他们的形象。有很多方法。

认真对待他们，第一。

## 饶恕与挣脱父母的认可 / Forgiveness and Freedom from Parental Approval

Number two. By the way, here's another way to take them seriously. Don't you remember how you used to hate it when you were growing up, that they always acted like they knew you and they knew exactly what you were doing and they knew exactly what you were thinking?

They would never let you change. They stereotyped you. Remember that?

How you used to hate that? Don't do that to them. Have you heard of the golden rule?

There's a tendency after years and years of being with them that you know exactly what they mean, exactly what they do, and exactly what they're thinking, and you can stereotype them. Honor their mystery. Recognize that they're people and they still change.

Anyway, number one, take them seriously. Number two, you have to forgive them. Now, the problem with forgiveness is great.

As I talk to people, I find there's a tremendous amount of resentment toward parents, and the reason for that is because the relationship between parents and children is really one like this. The parents start off as big and we start off as small, and as time goes on, they get weaker and we get stronger. And they should.

They're supposed to give us more freedom, give us more freedom, but many of us are bitter because our parents thrust us out into the cold world too soon, and either because they themselves were harsh and abusive or because they were alcoholics or they had problems with themselves or they had marital problems or something like that. We can get very, very bitter because we feel that for one reason or another we couldn't trust them when we still needed to. And they threw us out too soon.

And we can be pretty bitter about that, and I'm telling you the only way to honor your parents is to forgive them and do it for two reasons. One is do it for your sake. Do it for your sake.

I remember some years ago going by after we'd had some children come to vacation Bible school at our church in Virginia, and I went by and I knocked on a door and I said to a father who was there, and neither he nor his wife came to church, we said, listen, we'd be very happy to come on by with a car or a van or a bus and give your children a ride to Sunday school and to church on Sundays. And he looked at me and he said, I'm never going to have my children do that because all of my life my father made me go to church and made me go to Sunday school and I hated it and I'm not going to do that to my children. And this poor guy, because of his bitterness against his father, guess what, was still being controlled by that nasty old man because he hadn't forgiven him.

And what I say to people is, you know, maybe your father or your mother was really just as awful as you say, but the only way that person can continue to control you is if you stay resentful. They're still winning. They've won.

They're still controlling you. And the only way you can possibly actually get free from them, which is the purpose of growing up, is to forgive them. But do it for Christ's sake.

And here's why. You will never be able to love and honor your parents unless you are free from their need for their approval. You see, the whole purpose, the Bible tells us here, of child raising is to bring them up and get them free from you.

Physically, it's one thing to grow up. Psychologically, it's another thing to grow up. But spiritually, the only way to grow up to really be free from your parents is if you are looking beyond your parents to the love of your Heavenly Father.

I'll explain this. Because our parents really did represent God, it was natural that early on in our lives, our parents gave us meaning in life. If our parents said, well done, good and faithful servant, in whom I am well pleased.

If your parents talked like that, you felt that you were worthwhile. You felt that you were good. You felt that life had meaning, right?

But now what happens as you get older, some of you are still locked in that. Some of you are so dependent on what your parents think, and you're dependent in very strange ways. You don't even talk to them, maybe.

You may be that unhappy with them. And yet, you're driven to achieve, or you're driven to do certain things to show that bitter old person that was your father or your mother, that you really can be good, and you are still not free. Because you still need their verdict.

Because you still need their approval. And the only way to be free to honor your parents is if you look beyond and say, no, it's God's verdict, my Father in Heaven's approval who I need. And only His that I need.

第二。顺便说一句，这里还有另一种认真对待他们的方法。你还记得你小时候多么讨厌他们总是表现得好像他们了解你，知道你在做什么，知道你在想什么吗？

他们永远不会让你改变。他们给你贴上标签。记得吗？你多么讨厌那样？

不要那样对待他们。你听说过黄金法则吗？经过多年与他们在一起后，有一种倾向，你知道他们的意思，知道他们在做什么，知道他们在想什么，你可以给他们贴上标签。尊重他们的神秘。

承认他们是人，他们仍然在改变。无论如何，第一，认真对待他们。第二，你必须原谅他们。现在，原谅的问题很大。

当我与人交谈时，我发现对父母有很大的怨恨，原因是因为父母和孩子之间的关系真的是这样的。父母一开始是大的，我们一开始是小的，随着时间的推移，他们变得更弱，我们变得更强。他们应该。他们应该给我们更多的自由，给我们更多的自由，但我们中的许多人很苦，因为我们的父母太早把我们推到寒冷的世界中，要么是因为他们自己很严厉和虐待，要么是因为他们是酒鬼，或者他们自己有问题，或者他们有婚姻问题，或者类似的事情。

我们可以非常非常苦，因为我们觉得由于某种原因，当我们仍然需要他们时，我们无法信任他们。他们太早把我们推了出去。我们可能对此感到非常苦，我告诉你，尊重你的父母的唯一方法是原谅他们，并为两个原因这样做。一个是为了你自己。

为了你自己。我记得几年前，我们在弗吉尼亚的教会举办了一个暑期圣经学校，我们有一些孩子来参加，我经过一个门，敲门，我对一个在那里的人说，他和他的妻子都不去教堂，我们说，听着，我们很乐意开车或面包车或公共汽车来接你的孩子去参加主日学和周日教堂。他看着我说，我永远不会让我的孩子去，因为我父亲一生都让我去教堂，让我去主日学，我讨厌它，我不会对我的孩子这样做。这个可怜的家伙，因为对父亲的怨恨，你猜怎么着，仍然被那个讨厌的老头控制着，因为他没有原谅他。

我对人们说，也许你的父亲或母亲真的像你说的那样糟糕，但那个人继续控制你的唯一方法是如果你保持怨恨。他们仍然在赢。他们仍然在控制你。你唯一可能真正摆脱他们的方法，这是成长的目的，是原谅他们。

但为了基督的缘故这样做。这就是为什么。除非你不再需要他们的认可，否则你永远无法爱和尊重你的父母。你看，圣经告诉我们，抚养孩子的整个目的是养育他们，让他们不再需要你。

身体上，长大是一回事。心理上，长大是另一回事。但从精神上讲，唯一真正从父母那里长大的方法是，如果你超越父母，看到你天父的爱。我来解释一下。

因为我们的父母确实代表了上帝，所以在我们生命的早期，我们的父母给了我们生命的意义。如果我们的父母说，做得好，忠心的仆人，我很高兴。如果你的父母这样说，你会觉得你是有价值的。你觉得你是好的。

你觉得生活有意义，对吧？但现在发生的是，随着你长大，有些人仍然被困在那种状态。有些人非常依赖父母的看法，而且以非常奇怪的方式依赖。你甚至可能不和他们说话。

你可能对他们非常不满。然而，你被驱使去取得成就，或者你被驱使去做某些事情，以向那个苦涩的老人展示你的父亲或母亲，你真的可以是好的，而你仍然没有自由。因为你仍然需要他们的判决。因为你仍然需要他们的认可。

唯一能够自由地尊重你的父母的方法是，如果你超越并说，不，是上帝的判决，我在天上的父亲的认可是我需要的。只有他的认可是我需要的。

## 成为天父的儿女 / Becoming a Child of the Heavenly Father

**Becoming a Child of the Heavenly Father:**

Now the Bible tells us that being a Christian is this, it's to have God for your father. You may believe in God, you may believe in Him in a general way and lead a moral life, but if you don't know Him as your father, you are not really a believer. You want to know what it means to know Him as your father?

You go to Luke chapter 15, where we see the parable of the prodigal son. Here the prodigal son took all of his inheritance from his father. His father liquidated his inheritance, even though his father hadn't died.

He says, I don't want to wait for you to die, Father, I want your inheritance now. And so the father liquidated half of his belongings and gave them to the son, and he went off and he wasted it in a licentious life. And as he decided to come back and he decided to ask God, ask his father not just to come back to be his son, but only to be a slave.

He says, I will just come to my father and I will say, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, I'm not worthy to be called your son, just make me a slave. But what happens? Do you remember, before the son can even get his confession out of his mouth, the father comes running through the hedges and pounces on him and jumps on him and says, my son, my son, put on the best robe, put on my family ring again, let's kill the fatted calf, let's have a banquet because you've returned.

And what you learn there is, number one, father love is unconditional love. That's what you want. You've never been able to get that from any father or mother.

Some parents are better than others. Some parents are really good at it, some parents are terrible at it, but the thing that you must have and that you need down deep is that unconditional love, knowing, knowing, knowing what J. I.

Packer says, that is, that there's a tremendous relief in knowing that God's love to me is utterly realistic, based at every point on prior knowledge of the worst about me so that no discovery can disillusion him about me in the way I am so often disillusioned about myself and quench his determination to bless me. Father love, family love, is that kind of absolutely certain unconditional love. You can't get it from the places you've been looking.

You can't. But you can get it from this father. Because if God is your father, you know his love unconditionally.

If God is your father, you have access to him, and you can talk to him anytime. As great a man as he is, he's your father, so you don't have to go through a secretary. You don't have to make an appointment with him.

You have access to him. And you will even have his inheritance. And you will live with him forever.

That's what it means for God to be your father. Now, let me just conclude. Do you have the marks of sonship in your life?

Do you sense God's unconditional love for you through Jesus? Do you, for example, find that you're constantly needing to prove yourself to others and get approval and defend yourself? Or do you sense a relaxation in the spirit of saying, the real verdict is in, the final verdict is in, the real father loves me completely?

The only way that's possible is through Jesus Christ. Because Jesus Christ is the one, we're told in John 1.12, as many as received him, he gave power to become the sons of God. You need to be able to go to your parents and say, once you were God to me, but no more.

Now God inhabited my father, so I can finally be free to honor you as I ought. Take them seriously, forgive them, but most of all, grow up. How do you grow up to have God in heaven as your father?

**成为天父的孩子：** 现在，圣经告诉我们，成为基督徒的意思是，有上帝作为你的父亲。你可能相信上帝，你可能以一种普遍的方式相信他，并过着道德生活，但如果你不认识他作为你的父亲，你就不是真正的信徒。

你想知道认识他作为你的父亲是什么意思吗？你去路加福音第15章，我们看到浪子回头的比喻。这里浪子从父亲那里拿走了他所有的遗产。他的父亲变卖了他的遗产，尽管他的父亲还没有死。

他说，我不想等你死，父亲，我现在就要你的遗产。因此，父亲变卖了他的一半财产，给了儿子，儿子去了，浪费在放荡的生活中。当他决定回来时，他决定不只是回来做他的儿子，而是只做一个奴隶。他说，我会去找我的父亲，我会说，父亲，我得罪了天和你，我不配被称为你的儿子，只让我做一个奴隶。

但发生了什么？你还记得吗，在儿子甚至还没能把他的忏悔说出口之前，父亲穿过树篱跑来，扑到他身上，跳到他身上，说，我的儿子，我的儿子，穿上最好的袍子，戴上我的家族戒指，让我们杀掉肥牛犊，让我们举行宴会，因为你回来了。在那里你学到的是，第一，父爱是无条件的爱。这就是你想要的。

你从未能从任何父亲或母亲那里得到过。有些父母比其他父母更好。有些父母在这方面做得很好，有些父母在这方面做得很糟糕，但你必须拥有的东西，你内心深处需要的是那种无条件的爱，知道，知道，知道J.I. Packer所说的，那就是，知道上帝对我的爱是完全现实的，在每一点上都基于对我最坏的事先了解，以至于没有发现能使他对我失望，就像我对自己经常失望一样，并熄灭他祝福我的决心。父爱，家庭爱，是那种绝对确定的无条件的爱。

你不能从你一直在寻找的地方得到它。你不能。但你可以从这位父亲那里得到它。因为如果上帝是你的父亲，你知道他的爱是无条件的。

如果上帝是你的父亲，你可以随时与他交谈。作为一个伟大的人，他是你的父亲，所以你不必通过秘书。你不必与他预约。你可以与他交谈。

你甚至会有他的遗产。你会永远与他同住。这就是上帝作为你的父亲的意义。现在，让我总结一下。

你在生活中有儿子的标志吗？你通过耶稣感受到上帝对你的无条件的爱吗？例如，你是否发现你不断需要向他人证明自己，获得认可并为自己辩护？或者你是否感受到一种精神上的放松，说真正的判决已经到来，最终的判决已经到来，真正的父亲完全爱我？

唯一可能的方法是通过耶稣基督。因为耶稣基督是那位，我们在约翰福音1：12中被告知，凡接待他的人，他就赐他们权柄，成为上帝的儿女。你需要能够去你的父母那里说，曾经你是我的上帝，但不再是。现在上帝居住在我的父亲中，所以我终于可以自由地尊重你，像我应该的那样。

认真对待他们，原谅他们，但最重要的是，长大。你如何长大成为天上父亲的孩子？让我们祷告。感谢您收听提姆·凯勒在生命福音播客上的讲道。
