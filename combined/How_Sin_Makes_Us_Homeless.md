## 罪破坏了神的设计 / Sin Breaks God's Design

Now, because this is the third in the series, we need to take some stock what we're doing, why we're doing it, where we've come. We're talking about sin, doing a series on sin.

Why? Well, because early in the century, maybe late 19th century, early 20th century, this isn't, we can't be completely, you can't pinpoint this exactly, basically our Western society told us to get rid of the concept of sin. To get rid of it.

And there was some pretty good reasons for it. I mean, because of the abuses, they said, when you use the word sin and evil, when you use sin with regard to yourself, when you look at yourself and call yourself a sinner, you just crush yourself. Just make yourself feel guilty, you make yourself feel terrible and worthless, see?

Feel ashamed. And when you call other people's sinners, when you put sin on them, you do the same thing, you not only crush them and make them feel shame, but it probably might lead you to abuse them. They're sinners, so you can just treat them in all sorts of ways.

So sin was considered a dangerous and unhelpful category. And the reason at the time, there was some at least logical reason to get rid of it, was because at the very same time, many, many people in Europe and America were saying this, they were saying, well, you know, the troubles and the difficulties of our country and of our society, the reason people are filled with what the reason of for violence and for oppression and for selfishness is really because of unjust social conditions, because of bad education, because of bad environment. And through political and social transformations and the procedure, the progress of science, we can deal with these things.

It's a much better way of putting it. And of course, it does not do so much more optimistic, but we got a problem now. At the end of the 20th century, we've been through the Holocaust, we've been through two world wars, and a couple years ago, a book that's really had a big impact on me, Andrew Del Bonco, right up here at Columbia University wrote a book called The Death of Satan, fascinating book.

And he says something here, I'll read it to you. He says, a gulf has opened now in our culture between the visibility of evil and the intellectual resources available for coping with it. And then he puts it perfectly.

We now have an inescapable problem. We feel something that our culture no longer gives us the vocabulary to express. Now, it's pretty simple.

Look, Marxism, at least said, I know it's, we know it's wrong. You know, they had a theory what's wrong, why the why why we're so messed up. And of course, Marxism has done as a movement.

Freudianism had a theory about what's wrong with us, but it's over with a movement, you see? The optimistic idea that if we just educate people and we do this and that, we can deal with, you know, pressure and racism and violence and so forth, that's over. It's gone.

And Del Bonco says, but here's the weird thing. We got rid of vocabulary. We got rid of the concept of sin.

And now we see it in front of us when we can't talk about it. We can't deal with it. We feel ourselves in the presence of something that we no longer have the vocabulary to deal with.

It's terrible. In fact, next week, a couple weeks or now, come back and give you some examples that Del Bonco gives. I can't do that tonight.

But today, but here's the point. We have got to go back to the Bible to get the vocabulary. And here's my proposition to you.

The reason that the Bible's vocabulary concept of sin was jettison was partly because it wasn't very well understood. The average person, if I ask you, what's sin? You know, our memories of society about what the Bible says about sin is pretty simple.

Sin is breaking God's law. And that makes us guilty. And that's true.

And actually, I've got a sermon coming on that. But I want you to say that if you start with that, you really don't understand that multidimensional, profound, nuancedness of the biblical doctrine of sin. We started last week and we said, okay, first of all, sin is the first thing is that sin is breaking God's scale.

It is reducing God and that creates smallness of spirit. It's refusing to treat him as glorious, remember? Then last week, we said, sin is not just breaking God's scale, it's breaking God's heart.

Breaking God's scale and treating him is something less glorious than he is, making him too small, leads to strunginess of spirit. But when you replace God, when you break his heart and you reject his love, then what you're actually doing is you create addiction, remember that. So sin is smallness of spirit, sin is addiction.

Now, this week we're going to go, oh, still, before we get to the idea of breaking God's law, we have to understand it's breaking God's scale. That means it's treating him as less glorious than he is. Otherwise, you don't understand sin.

It's breaking God's heart. He says, I want to be the lover of your soul and we put ourselves in the arms of other lovers and as a result, we're addicts. This week, we're going to look at one more before we get anywhere else and that is sin is not just breaking God's scale, breaking God's heart.

It's also breaking God's design for us. You do not understand sin at all unless you think, unless you understand that sin is breaking God's design. See, God's law is not just an expression of his heart, so to break God's law, you're trampling on his heart.

God's law is also, it's your design print of your heart. It's the way you're built to work. And when you break God's law, you break yourself.

You're trampling on yourself. Let's get into this. This passage actually is telling us about that because it's telling us what the Messiah is going to do.

And the first thing it shows us is the Messiah is going to deal with the problems of life and that shows us something about sin. So here's how we're going to break this down. We're going to see what the problem is, what God is going to do about it and how we should respond.

What the problem is, what we should do about it, what God's going to do about it, how we should respond. First of all, what is the problem? Right away, we have to see this is remarkable.

All the things this Messiah does and the thing that first hits you is the range of them. First of all, take a look here. First of all, he deals with both body and soul.

For example, he comes to the poor. Collar read from Matthew 11, Jesus was very big on this passage. I'll tell you how big he was.

The first sermon he ever preached, he chose this text. Now, when you're going to start a campaign, you're really careful what you say that first time, isn't it? Because you want to make sure it's perfect.

It perfectly conveys what you're trying to, what you're all about. When Jesus Christ preaches very first sermon and look for, he preached on this text, Isaiah 61, 1 and 2. The first thing it comes up, preaches the poor.

That has to do with, he's dealing with economic brokenness. But then secondly, look at, he binds up the broken hearted. He's dealing with emotional brokenness.

Then it says, look, he's released from darkness. He releases from darkness. Now, you have to be careful because it says, proclaim freedom for the captors and release from darkness.

And those are two different things. It's not repetitious. And he's talking about intellectual blindness.

He's talking about spiritual blindness, not seeing the truth. But then lastly, and this is, this is what it takes just a moment to massage, all right? He says, he has been sent, he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the captors and then down to the second verse to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.

Now, this is not something you're going to get by reading it in English. What he's doing here, this person who comes and says, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of the Lord's favor, proclaim liberty. He is quoting Leviticus 25.

And Leviticus 25 is talking about the Jubilee. And this Messianic figure is coming to say, I have come to bring the Jubilee. What's that?

Well, let me tell you, you've heard the Sabbath. You've heard that in the Old Testament God said to the people, one day in seven Sabbath rest. But maybe you haven't heard that he also said to the people, one year in seven must be a Sabbath year.

He didn't just institute the Sabbath day. He also instituted a Sabbath year. And a Sabbath year was this.

In those days, when someone through poor crops, poor misfortune or poor judgment, would come to the place where you get so in debt you couldn't pay your debts off. What would happen is you would become an indentured servant to the people that you owed. And you would become their servant.

And of course, that's the sort of thing that happened. Some people got more prosperous. Some people didn't get as prosperous.

But every seventh year, God says Sabbath. What a Sabbath? In the Sabbath year, all debts were forgiven.

All servants went free, therefore. And the land was the life fallow which meant in order to build up its nutrients, the people were to eat out of the storehouses and not till the field. So everybody rested.

And the land rested. And you forgave your brother from the heart, their debts. And you forgave your brother from the heart, any wrongs that you had done.

That's the Sabbath year. But then on top of that, that was in the Old Testament. You can read about in Deuteronomy and Leviticus.

But in Leviticus 25, we have one of the weirder parts of the Old Testament. It's weird because it's so radical. And from what we can tell, it was never practiced.

And it's always the possibility that wasn't supposed to be. But here's what would happen. You said every seven days is a Sabbath day and every seven years is a Sabbath year.

But every Sabbath Sabbath. In other words, every seven Sabbath years, which would mean the 50th year, the Jubilee year, every seven seven of years, there was to be a Jubilee. And the Jubilee was even more extensive.

Not only were all the debts forgiven, not only were all the servants and the slaves freed. But if you lost your land any time in that 49 years, bad crops, bad judgment, if you had lost your land, your family's original land, it came back to you. And the whole purpose behind the Sabbath year, and the Jubilee, was how do you make sure that if you blow it, you get a running start, a second chance economically.

How do you make sure that you don't have long-term families getting down to the culture of poverty, learning habits that have to do with poverty, other people getting into the culture of wealth and having those kinds of habits. How do you do that? Well, that's how it was supposed to be done.

Now, one of the things that's pretty interesting about this is it clearly goes that the Jubilee was an institution that was not only for spiritual rest. It wasn't only the place where you were saying, I'm going to forgive you, and God has forgiven me. But it was also economically.

I was forgiving you, and I'm going to give you so that you can come up out of the place economically where you are. It's astounding. And it really was pretty remarkable.

And as far as we know, Israel never observed it. Can you imagine? And the Messiah shows up and says, I bring the Jubilee.

And he not only shows that this means body and soul are going to be put together. But if you look carefully, it also shows that he comes to not only deal with body and soul problems, but also individual and corporate problems, because look at verse three and verse four. In verse three, we see complete individual transformation.

I will bring you a crown of beauty. We'll get back to that. Oil of gladness, garments of praise, and you will become oaks of righteousness.

That's what it. That's not just symbolic. Oaks of righteousness means organic righteousness.

God is not just going to declare you righteous, which he does when he wraps you in the robe of righteousness in verse 10. But he's going to make you actually righteous. He's going to put his spirit in you.

He's going to put his nature in you. And that's what you have in verse three. You're going to become inside out, completely transformed.

But then in verse four, we see that they're supposed to go and rebuild cities. And if you look at verse four and five, it doesn't just say, oh, you know, forget the cities. You know, let's put up a new subdivision.

You go back and you rebuild the cities. And if you look carefully, in that city, there's going to be racial harmony. It says, it says aliens are going to be working with you.

You have to be a little careful because the English doesn't bring it out. It says, for example, when it says the aliens are going to shepherd your flocks, that word for shepherd doesn't just mean you. They're going to be your hired hands.

But that means that they're going to stand with you and they're going to take responsibility with you. There's a racial harmony. There's a rebuilding of cities.

There's personal transformation. There's social transformation. There's spiritual wholeness.

There's psychological wholeness. There's economic wholeness. There's racial wholeness.

现在,因为这是这个系列的第三讲,我们需要盘点一下我们在做什么,为什么这样做,我们走到了哪里。我们在谈论罪,做一个关于罪的系列。

为什么?嗯,因为在本世纪初,也许是19世纪末、20世纪初,这不是,我们不能完全确定,你不能准确地指出这一点,但基本上我们的西方社会告诉我们要摆脱罪的概念。摆脱它。

这样做有一些相当充分的理由。我的意思是,因为这些滥用,他们说,当你使用罪和邪恶这个词时,当你把罪用在你自己身上时,当你审视自己并称自己为罪人时,你只是在打击自己。只是让自己感到内疚,让自己感觉糟糕和毫无价值,明白吗?

感到羞耻。而当你称其他人为罪人时,当你把罪加在他们身上时,你做的是同样的事情,你不仅打击他们,让他们感到羞耻,而且这可能会导致你虐待他们。他们是罪人,所以你可以用各种方式对待他们。

所以罪被认为是一个危险和无益的范畴。而当时的理由,至少有一些合乎逻辑的理由来摆脱它,是因为在同一时间,在欧洲和美国有许多许多人这样说,他们说,嗯,你知道,我们国家和社会的麻烦和困难,人们充满暴力、压迫和自私的原因,实际上是因为不公正的社会条件,因为糟糕的教育,因为糟糕的环境。通过政治和社会变革以及科学的进步,我们可以处理这些事情。

这是一种好得多的表述方式。当然,这确实不那么乐观了,但我们现在有一个问题。在20世纪末,我们经历了大屠杀,我们经历了两次世界大战,几年前,一本真正对我产生了重大影响的书,安德鲁·德尔班科,就在哥伦比亚大学这里,写了一本叫《撒但之死》的书,引人入胜的书。

他在这里说了一些话,我读给你听。他说,现在在我们的文化中,在邪恶的可见性和可用于应对它的智力资源之间出现了一道鸿沟。然后他说得很完美。

我们现在有一个不可避免的问题。我们感受到一些东西,但我们的文化不再给我们表达它的词汇。现在,这很简单。

看,马克思主义至少说,我知道这是,我们知道这是错误的。你知道,他们有一个理论,说明什么是错的,为什么我们如此混乱。当然,作为一个运动,马克思主义已经完了。

弗洛伊德主义有一个关于我们出了什么问题的理论,但作为一个运动,它已经结束了,你明白吗?那种乐观的想法,认为如果我们只是教育人们,我们这样做那样做,我们就可以处理,你知道,压力、种族主义、暴力等等,那已经结束了。它消失了。

德尔班科说,但这就是奇怪的事情。我们摆脱了词汇。我们摆脱了罪的概念。

现在我们在面前看到它,却无法谈论它。我们无法处理它。我们感到自己处在某种东西的面前,却不再有词汇来处理它。

这太糟糕了。事实上,下周,或者现在几周后,回来我会给你一些德尔班科给出的例子。我今晚不能做那个。

但今天,但这里是重点。我们必须回到圣经去获得词汇。这是我给你的命题。

圣经关于罪的词汇概念之所以被抛弃,部分原因是它没有被很好地理解。普通人,如果我问你,什么是罪?你知道,我们关于圣经所说的罪的社会记忆是相当简单的。

罪就是违背神的律法。这使我们有罪。这是真的。

实际上,我有一篇关于这个的讲道要讲。但我想告诉你,如果你从这个开始,你真的不理解圣经关于罪的教义的多维度、深刻、细微差别。我们上周开始说,好吧,首先,罪的第一件事是罪违背了神的尺度。

它是贬低神,这创造了灵里的狭小。它拒绝把他当作荣耀的,记得吗?然后上周,我们说,罪不仅仅是违背神的尺度,它是打破神的心。

违背神的尺度,把他当作不如他荣耀的东西,使他变小,导致灵里的吝啬。但当你取代神,当你打破他的心,拒绝他的爱时,你实际上在做的是创造成瘾,记得那个吗。所以罪是灵里的狭小,罪是成瘾。

现在这周我们要继续,哦,仍然,在我们到达违背神律法的观念之前,我们必须理解它是违背神的尺度。这意味着它把他当作不如他荣耀的东西。否则,你不理解罪。

它是打破神的心。他说,我想成为你灵魂的爱人,而我们把自己投入其他爱人的怀抱,结果,我们是瘾君子。这周,在我们到达其他任何地方之前,我们要再看一个,那就是罪不仅仅是违背神的尺度,打破神的心。

它也是打破神对我们的设计。你根本不理解罪,除非你思考,除非你理解罪是打破神的设计。看,神的律法不仅仅是他心的表达,所以违背神的律法,你是在践踏他的心。

神的律法也是,它是你心的设计蓝图。这是你被建造来运作的方式。当你违背神的律法时,你打破了你自己。

你在践踏你自己。让我们进入这个。这段经文实际上告诉我们这个,因为它告诉我们弥赛亚要做什么。

它向我们展示的第一件事是弥赛亚要处理生活的问题,这向我们展示了关于罪的一些东西。所以我们要这样分解这个。我们要看问题是什么,神要对此做什么,以及我们应该如何回应。

问题是什么,我们应该做什么,神要对此做什么,我们应该如何回应。首先,问题是什么?马上,我们必须看到这是显著的。

这位弥赛亚所做的所有事情,首先打动你的是它们的范围。首先,看这里。首先,他处理身体和灵魂。

例如,他来到贫穷人那里。科勒从马太福音11章读到,耶稣非常看重这段经文。我会告诉你他有多看重。

他讲的第一篇讲道,他选择了这段经文。现在,当你要开始一个运动时,你真的很小心你第一次说什么,不是吗?因为你想确保它是完美的。

它完美地传达你想要的,你的全部内容。当耶稣基督讲他的第一篇讲道时,看看,他讲的是这段经文,以赛亚书61章1和2节。它首先出现的是,向贫穷人传道。

这与经济破碎有关。但其次,看,他医治伤心的人。他在处理情感破碎。

然后它说,看,他从黑暗中释放。他从黑暗中释放。现在,你必须小心,因为它说,宣告被掳的得自由,从黑暗中得释放。

这是两件不同的事情。它不是重复的。他在谈论智力盲目。

他在谈论属灵盲目,看不见真理。但最后,这是,这只需要花点时间来理解,好吗?他说,他被差遣,他差遣我医治伤心的人,宣告被掳的得自由,然后到第二节,宣告耶和华的恩年。

现在,这不是你通过读英文就能理解的东西。他在这里做的,这个来说"主的灵在我身上,宣告主的恩年"、宣告自由的人,他在引用利未记25章。

利未记25章在谈论禧年。这位弥赛亚人物来说,我来带来禧年。那是什么?

好吧,让我告诉你,你听说过安息日。你听说在旧约中神对人们说,七日中有一日安息日安息。但也许你没有听说他还对人们说,七年中有一年必须是安息年。

他不仅设立了安息日。他还设立了安息年。安息年是这样的。

在那些日子里,当有人因为收成不好、不幸或判断失误,来到一个你负债累累无法偿还债务的地方。会发生的是你会成为你所欠之人的契约仆人。你会成为他们的仆人。

当然,这种事情会发生。有些人变得更繁荣。有些人没有那么繁荣。

但每七年,神说安息。什么是安息?在安息年,所有债务都被免除。

因此所有仆人都获得自由。土地要休耕,这意味着为了积累养分,人们要从仓库里吃,而不耕种田地。所以每个人都休息。

土地也休息。你从心里饶恕你弟兄的债务。你从心里饶恕你弟兄任何你所做的错事。

那是安息年。但除此之外,那是在旧约中。你可以在申命记和利未记中读到。

但在利未记25章,我们有旧约中更奇怪的部分之一。它很奇怪因为它如此激进。从我们所能知道的,它从未被实行过。

它总是有可能本来就不应该被实行。但这里是会发生的事情。你说每七天是一个安息日,每七年是一个安息年。

但每个安息的安息。换句话说,每七个安息年,这意味着第50年,禧年,每七个七年,要有一个禧年。禧年甚至更广泛。

不仅所有债务被免除,不仅所有仆人和奴隶被释放。而且如果你在那49年内的任何时候失去了你的土地,收成不好,判断失误,如果你失去了你的土地,你家族的原始土地,它会回到你手中。安息年和禧年背后的整个目的是,如果你搞砸了,你如何确保得到一个新的开始,在经济上的第二次机会。

你如何确保你不会有长期家庭陷入贫困文化,学习与贫困有关的习惯,其他人进入财富文化并拥有那些习惯。你怎么做到这一点?嗯,那就是应该这样做的方式。

现在,关于这个相当有趣的一件事是,禧年显然是一个制度,它不仅是为了属灵的安息。它不仅是你说"我要饶恕你,神已经饶恕我"的地方。而且它在经济上也是这样。

我要饶恕你,我要给你,这样你就可以从你所在的经济地位中走出来。这令人震惊。它真的相当显著。

据我们所知,以色列从未遵守过它。你能想象吗?弥赛亚出现并说,我带来禧年。

他不仅表明这意味着身体和灵魂将被放在一起。而且如果你仔细看,它还表明他不仅来处理身体和灵魂的问题,还有个人和集体的问题,因为看第三节和第四节。在第三节,我们看到完全的个人转变。

我要给你华冠。我们会回到这个。喜乐油,赞美衣,你将成为公义树。

那就是它。那不仅仅是象征性的。公义树意味着有机的公义。

神不仅要宣告你为义,他在第10节用公义袍包裹你时就这样做了。但他要实际使你成为义。他要把他的灵放在你里面。

他要把他的本性放在你里面。这就是你在第三节所拥有的。你将从内到外,完全转变。

但然后在第四节,我们看到他们应该去重建城市。如果你看第四节和第五节,它不只是说,哦,你知道,忘记城市。你知道,让我们建一个新的分区。

你回去重建城市。如果你仔细看,在那个城市里,将会有种族和谐。它说,它说外人将与你一起工作。

你必须小心一点,因为英文没有把它表达出来。它说,例如,当它说外人要牧放你们的羊群时,那个牧放的词不仅仅意味着你。他们不仅仅是你的雇工。

而是意味着他们将与你站在一起,他们将与你一起承担责任。有种族和谐。有城市的重建。

有个人的转变。有社会的转变。有属灵的完整。

有心理的完整。有经济的完整。有种族的完整。

## 罪的工价:灰尘 / The Wages of Sin: Ashes

The whole nine yards. And the Messiah comes back and says, that's what I'm about to do. Now, what does that tell us about sin?

That's the first point. And here's what it tells us about sin. The wages of sin is ashes.

You notice in verse three, it says, I will put a crown of beauty on where you have ashes. And he's thinking very literally, when somebody died or when anything went really wrong in your life, you didn't just put on black. What you did was you put ashes.

You went into the fireplace and you picked up ashes and you put them on your forehead. And not just a little cute little cross, you say that you put even today at Lent in many churches where you put the ashes on there for good for Ash Wednesday. No, you poured it on your head.

Think about it. You looked ugly. You were totally dirty.

And here's what you were saying. Life is like this. The Bible, what are ashes?

You put something in the fire. And the fire knocks it apart. There's chemicals that were coherent.

You put a wooden fire and there was a cohesion. There was a coherence. It was integrated.

There was all these various sorts of chemicals and various things that turned it into wood. But what does the fire do? The fire destroys that which keeps those things that should be together.

It destroys the coherence and it goes to ashes. If you put your hand in the fire, it'll go to ashes. If you put your paper in the fire, it'll go to ashes.

But you see, when the Messiah says, I'm going to give you beauty for ashes. He's actually referring to everything he's been looking at in a whole survey. Because essentially life is like that.

My favorite illustration is, there's a couple of ways to put it. Think of a chicken in your oven. You bring the chicken out.

You put it on the table. Too hot to eat. So you wait for 15 minutes.

And you're happy. Why? Because now I can eat it.

But the only reason you can eat it is because it's losing energy. Because that's how life is. Leave it for three hours.

Then you won't want to eat it. It loses energy until it's kind of yucky. Leave it for three days.

And now it's a help hazard. Leave it for three weeks. But when you watch it, go to pieces.

Oh, of course, if you could burn it up, you see, in the fire, it goes to ashes very quickly. But don't you see? If you just let it be, it's going to ashes anyway.

And as you watch the chicken go to ashes, why? Because that's the way existence is. You're looking in a mirror.

You're going to ashes. If you put yourself into the fire, you'll go to ashes very quickly. But if it doesn't matter, die at all you want.

Go to the doctor all you want, okay? Exercise all you want to keep yourself together, to keep yourself whole, to keep yourself tight, but you're spreading. And you will continue to spread until finally, you are ashes.

You are dust, dust thou art, ashes thou art. Now what are we talking about here? The Bible says that the whole world is burning in a flame of sin.

That when I want to be my own master, when I want to be my own Lord, when I want to be my own Savior, what I'm just doing essentially is I put fire, sin is fire against the design that God has for the way He wants things to be, which is peace, flourishing, growth, shalom, which is the Hebrew word for peace, but it means every kind of human flourishing. Now you can get this down into the micro. Can I get it out of the micro?

Somebody treats you bad. And you say, I'm not going to forgive. I will not forgive.

And some of you are in this situation right now, right now. The Bible says God says, I forgive, therefore you must forgive you must forgive. That's the word of God.

If you don't forgive, that's a sin. Now let's think about this for a second. All right.

If you sin, what are the consequences of sin? Well, a lot of people say, I'm just scared, you know, maybe God won't answer my prayer if I keep my sin in my heart. Maybe that's that.

Well, it does say that. Okay. So maybe you think of sin like this.

I better not sin because God's sort of watching me. And as long as I stay sinful, you know, God's going to get me. He's going to watch me say, boy, that person's sinning, what can I do to make their life miserable today?

But boy, you misunderstand. You misunderstand. When you hold that grudge, the doctor will tell you that that's that is actually turning up the flame on your heart.

You're much more likely to have heart problems. You're much more likely to stomach problems. You're much more likely to have physical problems because you're mad.

But not only that, of course, you start to break down psychologically. You'll be in denial. It'll control you.

But, of course, it breaks you down spiritually. Sin disintegrates us. Sin makes us break down.

Sin puts, sin is an invisible flame. It's visible to God. Oh God sees it.

God looks down and he sees us all on fire. He sees us all fall into part. Why?

Because what we're doing is we're going against our design. Whenever you want to be your own savior, your own master, it's not like oh gosh, you know, here I did what I shouldn't have done today. I wonder where the God's going to get me.

Sin is guilty, but sin is, first of all, stupid. Sin does break God's law, but God's law is simply the way he built you. He built you to love, not to hate.

He built you to be unselfish, not to be selfish. He built you not to spend all your money on yourself. That's the reason why he says, give it away.

He built you to forgive. That's why he says forgive. He built you to have sex inside.

A covenant of marriage. That's why he says to do that. None of this is busy work.

This is not like my eighth grade algebra teacher. You used to say, well, you know, kids got to be still off the street. So as you say, do all these things to keep you off the street.

That's busy work. There's no busy work in the will of God. God comes and says, I built you this way.

You will only flourish. If you break this, you break yourself. If you trample on this, you're trampling on your own heart.

If you're trampling on this, you're trampling on your own world. And every time you send you just turning the flame up, turning up the burner, and you go to ashes faster, do you see that? Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache.

We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way? And what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr.

Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us, and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now that's a negative part of this point. Let me tell you what the positive part is.

The positive part is the Messiah comes to deal with all the results of sin. The Messiah comes not look at Messiah does not come only to forgive your sins, give you peace in your in your little heart, and take you to heaven. The Messiah does not come to earth and say, let me take you away from all this.

He doesn't do that. Instead, he says I'm going to give you a joy and a power so we can rehab the world. I can give you a I'm going to bring you a joy and a power inside.

I'm going to remake you inside so we can remake the whole world together. My power, my spirit, my goal is not just simply to take you into some other world of esoteric consciousness. Listen, every other religion says that.

Eastern and Western, what's the ideal? What's the ideal? Paradise or the all-soul or something like that.

That's never what Christianity or Judaism has ever talked about. It talks about the new heavens. It talks about the new earth.

It means matter is good. Jesus didn't just die to save our souls. He also rose to save our bodies.

What else is the resurrection for? Therefore, when the Messiah comes, he's going to say, I have come back to make things whole. I've come back to, first of all, turn off the fire and then to rebuild everything, restore everything, say, reweave everything, make everything whole.

That's what he's after. That's the only way you can understand so many of the prophecies of Isaiah. That's the problem.

Now, how is God going to do that? And the answer is here in this tremendous Messiah.

应有尽有。弥赛亚回来说,这就是我要做的。现在,这告诉我们关于罪的什么?

这是第一点。这是它告诉我们关于罪的。罪的工价是灰尘。

你注意到在第三节,它说,我要在你有灰尘的地方给你戴上华冠。他在非常字面地思考,当有人死去或当你生活中发生真正糟糕的事情时,你不只是穿黑色。你做的是你放灰尘。

你走进壁炉,拿起灰尘,放在你的额头上。不仅仅是一个可爱的小十字架,你说今天在许多教会的大斋期你在圣灰星期三那里放灰尘。不,你把它倒在你的头上。

想想看。你看起来很丑。你完全脏了。

这就是你在说的。生活就是这样的。圣经,什么是灰尘?

你把什么东西放进火里。火把它分解。有一些化学物质是连贯的。

你把木头放进火里,有一种凝聚力。有一种连贯性。它是整合的。

有各种各样的化学物质和各种东西把它变成木头。但火做什么?火摧毁那些使应该在一起的东西在一起的东西。

它摧毁连贯性,它变成灰尘。如果你把手放进火里,它会变成灰尘。如果你把纸放进火里,它会变成灰尘。

但你看,当弥赛亚说,我要给你以华冠代替灰尘。他实际上是在指他在整个调查中一直在看的一切。因为本质上生活就是这样的。

我最喜欢的例证是,有几种方法可以表达它。想想你烤箱里的鸡。你把鸡拿出来。

你把它放在桌子上。太热了不能吃。所以你等15分钟。

你很高兴。为什么?因为现在我可以吃它了。

但你能吃它的唯一原因是因为它正在失去能量。因为这就是生活的样子。把它放三个小时。

然后你就不想吃它了。它失去能量,直到它有点恶心。放三天。

现在它是一个健康危害。放三周。但当你看着它,散架。

哦,当然,如果你能烧掉它,你看,在火里,它很快就会变成灰尘。但你不明白吗?如果你只是让它在那里,它无论如何都会变成灰尘。

当你看着鸡变成灰尘时,为什么?因为这就是存在的方式。你在照镜子。

你正在变成灰尘。如果你把自己放进火里,你会很快变成灰尘。但如果这不重要,随便你死。

随便去看医生。好吗?随便你运动,让自己保持在一起,让自己完整,让自己紧凑,但你在扩散。你将继续扩散,直到最后,你是灰尘。

你是尘土,你本是尘土,你是灰尘。现在我们在这里谈论什么?圣经说整个世界都在罪的火焰中燃烧。

当我想成为自己的主人,当我想成为自己的主,当我想成为自己的救主时,我所做的本质上就是放火,罪是对神对他希望事物存在方式的设计的火,那就是和平、繁荣、成长、平安,这是希伯来语中和平的词,但它意味着各种人类的繁荣。现在你可以把这个深入到微观。我能不能把它从微观中拿出来?

有人对你不好。你说,我不会原谅。我不会原谅。

你们中的一些人现在就处在这种情况下,现在。圣经说神说,我饶恕,因此你必须饶恕,你必须饶恕。这是神的话。

如果你不饶恕,那就是罪。现在让我们想一想这个。好吧。

如果你犯罪,罪的后果是什么?嗯,很多人说,我只是害怕,你知道,也许如果我把罪留在心里,神不会回答我的祷告。也许就是那样。

嗯,它确实这样说。好吧。所以也许你这样想罪。

我最好不要犯罪,因为神在某种程度上看着我。只要我保持有罪,你知道,神会抓住我。他会看着我说,天哪,那个人在犯罪,我今天能做什么让他们的生活痛苦?

但是,天哪,你误解了。你误解了。当你怀着那个怨恨时,医生会告诉你,那实际上是在给你的心脏加火。

你更有可能有心脏问题。你更有可能有胃问题。你更有可能有身体问题,因为你生气。

但不仅如此,当然,你开始在心理上崩溃。你会否认。它会控制你。

但是,当然,它在属灵上打垮你。罪使我们瓦解。罪使我们崩溃。

罪放,罪是一种无形的火焰。它对神是可见的。哦,神看见它。

神俯视,他看见我们都着火了。他看见我们都在散架。为什么?

因为我们所做的是违背我们的设计。每当你想成为自己的救主、自己的主人时,这不像哦天哪,你知道,今天我做了我不该做的事。我想知道神会在哪里抓住我。

罪是有罪的,但罪,首先是愚蠢的。罪确实违背了神的律法,但神的律法就是他建造你的方式。他建造你去爱,而不是去恨。

他建造你无私,而不是自私。他建造你不要把所有的钱花在自己身上。这就是他说,把它给出去的原因。

他建造你去饶恕。这就是他说要饶恕的原因。他建造你在婚姻盟约内有性。这就是他说要这样做的原因。这些都不是忙碌的工作。

这不像我八年级的代数老师。你过去常说,嗯,你知道,孩子们必须远离街头。所以你说,做所有这些事情让你远离街头。

那是忙碌的工作。神的旨意中没有忙碌的工作。神来说,我这样建造你。

你只有这样才会繁荣。如果你打破这个,你打破你自己。如果你践踏这个,你在践踏你自己的心。

如果你践踏这个,你在践踏你自己的世界。每次你犯罪,你只是把火焰调高,调高炉子,你更快地变成灰尘,你明白吗?无论我们看哪里,我们都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。

我们在我们周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到它。它怎么变成这样的?对此能做什么?

在他本月发行的全新书中,世界出了什么问题?提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。从在救赎主教会所做的一系列教导中汲取,凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦,以及只有福音如何提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状态所压倒,还是在与自己的错误或选择斗争,还是在寻找希望和喜乐,《世界出了什么问题》将帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛又对我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发行的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们对你本月帮助"生命中的福音"分享耶稣的好消息的礼物的感谢。

今天就在gospelandlife.com斜杠give请求你的副本。那是gospelandlife.com斜杠give。现在这里是凯勒博士和今天教导的其余部分。

现在那是这一点的消极部分。让我告诉你积极的部分是什么。

积极的部分是弥赛亚来处理罪的所有结果。弥赛亚来不看弥赛亚不只是来赦免你的罪,在你的小心里给你平安,带你去天堂。弥赛亚不来到地球说,让我带你离开这一切。

他不那样做。相反,他说我要给你一个喜乐和能力,这样我们就可以改造世界。我可以给你一个,我要在里面给你带来一个喜乐和能力。

我要在里面重新塑造你,这样我们就可以一起重新塑造整个世界。我的能力,我的灵,我的目标不仅仅是把你带入某个其他的神秘意识世界。听着,所有其他宗教都这样说。

东方和西方,理想是什么?理想是什么?天堂或万有之灵或类似的东西。

这从来不是基督教或犹太教所谈论的。它谈论新天。它谈论新地。

这意味着物质是好的。耶稣不仅死来拯救我们的灵魂。他也复活来拯救我们的身体。

复活还为了什么?因此,当弥赛亚来时,他要说,我回来使事物完整。我回来,首先,关掉火焰,然后重建一切,恢复一切,说,重新编织一切,使一切完整。

这就是他追求的。这是你能理解以赛亚书许多预言的唯一方式。这就是问题。

现在,神要如何做到这一点?答案就在这位了不起的弥赛亚身上。

## 征服的君王与受苦的仆人 / The Conquering King and Suffering Servant

Now, this Messiah, in verse 1, again, I have to give you a little help.

It doesn't hit you right away as an English reader so much. But anyway, this particular Messiah, right away, we're told the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach. Now, before we go on any further, the Lord has anointed me to preach.

Now, this is what that's saying. If you really read all of Isaiah, and you know, it's very hard, and I want to admit, I don't want anybody to go away feeling guilty because it's too hard. It's very hard to read Isaiah.

It's a long book. But I didn't realize until because of you, because I had to do this for you, I had to read the whole book. For the first of my life, I realized that there is a narrative, and there's an enormous crisis coming up to chapter 61 when you read the book.

Because in the early part of the book of Isaiah, we're told that there's going to be this strong, incredible, Davidic king, someone who's going to raise a banner. In fact, in Isaiah 11, verses 1 and 2, it says, this great king is going to come and he's going to raise a banner and he's going to be glorious and he's going to summons the nation and he's going to put down all evil and he's going to make the whole world right. And it says, the spirit of the Lord will be upon him to do this.

And so this is a reference to Psalm 2, Isaiah 11. And that makes sense to us. They say, yes, the world is a mess.

We need somebody to come in and deliver us. But then in the middle part of Isaiah, starting in Isaiah 42, suddenly a new figure appears in these prophecies. And this figure is utterly unlike the old, the anointed king of the earlier chapters.

Utterly unlike the anointed king, this is what's called in the literature, the servant. And in Isaiah 42, Isaiah 49, Isaiah 50, and Isaiah 53, we're going to go next week. A new figure arises.

And we're told that he's not attractive. He's totally unlike the anointed conqueror. The anointed conqueror is glorious and we all want him.

This one we're told, Isaiah 53 has no beauty. No beauty with which we should desire him. And we're told, of course, the great anointed conqueror is going to go on to victory.

However, this figure is going to suffer. This figure is utterly unstrong. What do we tell about this figure?

We're told he had no beauty that we should desire him, but we're also told as a lamb before her shearers is silent. So he opened not his mouth. And he was led to slaughter.

He's likened to a little lamb. He's likened to a female lamb. He's likened to one of the most weak little creatures in the animal kingdom.

And so this is a person who's utterly different. Then the first person, why is Isaiah doing this? What's going on?

Who is this person? But we're told in Isaiah 42, verse one, that this servant is the one who is anointed by the spirit. And this is the reason why when you come to Isaiah chapter 61, first one, if you've been reading it all along and especially been reading in Hebrew, which is what they originally did, you suddenly, your jaw drops, hits the top of your chest.

You can't believe it because up to now, you've either had somebody who's suffering and sweet and nice and sacrificing and ugly and defeated, or you have this incredibly, you know, this conqueror, this strong one, this glorious one, this beautiful one. And suddenly, we see that they're the same person. As Isaiah 61 says, this is the same one because not only does he proclaim freedom to the captives, he binds up to broken hearted.

The warrior is a nurse. How could this be the same person? But Isaiah says, this is my breakthrough.

This is my theological breakthrough. This is what the Lord has shown me. The victory will be a defeat.

The strong one will be incredibly weak. The salvation will happen not by you, summonsing up your strength and obeying this great king. It will happen because this great king will become incredibly weak and suffer and be defeated and die.

Now, somebody says, how could that be? Why would that be? I don't get it.

And here's the answer, in verse three, three little words instead. Three little words instead. It says, I will provide for those who grieve in Zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes that oil of gladness instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.

Now, that's not too bad a translation. It kind of gets at it. But basically, what we're told is that the Messiah is not just simply saying, you've got your ashes.

Let me put a crown of beauty on top of your ashes, right? He's not saying, you've got your, you know, you have your, your mourning, but let me, let me put oil on top of you. No, he's saying, I'll give you what I've got.

You give me what you've got. What we have here is the principle of substitution. And all of a sudden, we realize why he's not beautiful.

Why isn't he beautiful? Because we got his beauty. He gets our ashes.

Why are we joyful? Because he got his joy. He gets our despair.

This is the reason why on the cross, he cries out, my God, my God, why has nothing for sake? I mean, that's despair. We got his despair.

Pardon me. He got our despair. You see that?

This means he'd have to be so incredibly strong. Don't you see? It's one thing if you are a lamb to face your shears and or to fit in at your shears.

It's one thing if you are a lamb to face the people who are about to kill you. You see, with a certain poise, it's another thing when you're not a lamb to become a lamb. It's one thing if you are ugly to live with it.

It's another thing if you're beautiful, the voluntarily become ugly. Somebody else can be beautiful. Do you see what's going on here?

Behold the beauty of his voluntary ugliness. Behold the strength of his voluntary weakness. He had to be that strong.

He had to be the first figure if he could in order to be the second figure. And of course, being the second figure, he wasn't something that he was something he had to do. He did it for us.

And therefore, substitution. Jesus Christ, when he comes to earth, is able to deal with the fire of sin because he personally has to go through every aspect of the devastation of sin. He is physically broken.

That's the reason why he gets ashes. He is psychologically broken. That's why he gets mourning.

And he spiritually broken in that the father cuts him off. He's like, God, my God, why I stop forsaking me so he gets the spirit of despair. Now, what does that mean for us practically?

现在,这位弥赛亚,在第1节,再次,我必须给你一点帮助。

作为一个英语读者,它不会马上打动你。但无论如何,这位特别的弥赛亚,马上,我们被告知主耶和华的灵在我身上,因为主用膏膏我传道。现在,在我们继续之前,主用膏膏我传道。

现在,这就是在说什么。如果你真的读了所有的以赛亚书,你知道,这很难,我想承认,我不想让任何人因为太难而感到内疚。读以赛亚书很难。

这是一本长书。但我没有意识到,直到因为你,因为我必须为你做这个,我必须读整本书。我第一次意识到有一个叙事,当你读这本书时,有一个巨大的危机上升到第61章。

因为在以赛亚书的早期部分,我们被告知将有这位强大的、不可思议的、大卫的君王,一个将要举起旗帜的人。事实上,在以赛亚书11章,第1和第2节,它说,这位伟大的君王要来,他要举起旗帜,他将是荣耀的,他将召集国家,他将镇压一切邪恶,他将使整个世界正确。它说,主的灵将在他身上做这事。

所以这是对诗篇2篇、以赛亚书11章的引用。这对我们来说是有意义的。他们说,是的,世界是一团糟。

我们需要有人进来拯救我们。但然后在以赛亚书的中间部分,从以赛亚书42章开始,突然一个新人物出现在这些预言中。这个人物与旧的,早期章节的受膏君王完全不同。

完全不同于受膏的君王,这是文献中所谓的仆人。在以赛亚书42章、以赛亚书49章、以赛亚书50章和以赛亚书53章,我们下周要讲。一个新人物出现了。

我们被告知他没有吸引力。他完全不像受膏的征服者。受膏的征服者是荣耀的,我们都想要他。

这个我们被告知,以赛亚书53章说没有美貌。没有我们应该渴望他的美貌。我们被告知,当然,伟大的受膏征服者将走向胜利。

然而,这个人物将受苦。这个人物完全不强壮。我们被告知关于这个人物什么?

我们被告知他没有我们应该渴望他的美貌,但我们也被告知,像羔羊在剪毛的人面前默默无声。所以他不开口。他被带去宰杀。

他被比作小羔羊。他被比作母羊羔。他被比作动物王国中最弱小的生物之一。

所以这是一个完全不同的人。那么第一个人,为什么以赛亚这样做?发生了什么?

这个人是谁?但我们在以赛亚书42章第1节被告知,这个仆人是被灵膏抹的。这就是为什么当你来到以赛亚书第61章,第一节,如果你一直在读它,特别是用希伯来语读,那是他们原来做的,你突然,你的下巴掉下来,打到你的胸口顶部。

你不能相信,因为到现在为止,你要么有一个受苦的、甜美的、善良的、牺牲的、丑陋的、被击败的人,要么你有这个令人难以置信的,你知道,这个征服者,这个强壮的,这个荣耀的,这个美丽的。突然,我们看到他们是同一个人。正如以赛亚书61章所说,这是同一个,因为他不仅宣告被掳的得自由,他还医治伤心的人。

战士是护士。这怎么可能是同一个人?但以赛亚说,这是我的突破。

这是我的神学突破。这是主向我显明的。胜利将是一次失败。

强壮的将是难以置信的软弱。拯救不会通过你,召集你的力量,服从这位伟大的君王来实现。它将发生,因为这位伟大的君王将变得难以置信的软弱,受苦,被击败,死去。

现在,有人说,这怎么可能?为什么会这样?我不明白。

这里是答案,在第三节,三个小词"代替"。三个小词代替。它说,我要为锡安悲哀的人预备,赐他们华冠代替灰尘,喜乐油代替悲哀,赞美衣代替忧伤之灵。

现在,那不是太糟糕的翻译。它有点接近了。但基本上,我们被告知的是弥赛亚不只是简单地说,你有你的灰尘。

让我在你的灰尘上面给你戴上华冠,对吗?他不是说,你有你的,你知道,你有你的,你的悲哀,但让我,让我在你上面涂油。不,他在说,我会给你我所拥有的。

你给我你所拥有的。我们这里有的是替代的原则。突然,我们意识到为什么他不美丽。

为什么他不美丽?因为我们得到了他的美丽。他得到我们的灰尘。

为什么我们喜乐?因为他得到了他的喜乐。他得到我们的绝望。

这就是为什么在十字架上,他呼喊,我的神,我的神,你为什么离弃我?我的意思是,那是绝望。我们得到了他的绝望。

原谅我。他得到了我们的绝望。你明白吗?

这意味着他必须如此难以置信地强壮。你不明白吗?如果你是一只羔羊,面对你的剪羊毛者是一回事,或者符合你的剪羊毛者。

如果你是一只羔羊,面对要杀你的人是一回事。你看,有一定的镇定,当你不是一只羔羊却成为一只羔羊时,那是另一回事。如果你很丑,忍受它是一回事。

如果你很美丽,却自愿变丑是另一回事。其他人可以美丽。你明白这里发生了什么吗?

看他自愿的丑陋之美。看他自愿的软弱之力量。他必须那么强壮。

他必须是第一个人物,如果他能够成为第二个人物。当然,成为第二个人物,他不是他所是的东西,而是他必须做的事情。他为我们做的。

因此,替代。耶稣基督,当他来到地上时,能够处理罪的火焰,因为他个人必须经历罪的毁灭的每一个方面。他在身体上被打碎。

这就是他得到灰尘的原因。他在心理上被打碎。这就是他得到悲哀的原因。

他在属灵上被打碎,因为父切断了他。他像,神,我的神,为什么我停止离弃我,所以他得到了绝望之灵。现在,这对我们实际上意味着什么?

## 活出禧年 / Living the Jubilee

Let's get to that. Let's make a little list. How should we respond?

Number one, please trust him. Now, here's what I'm saying. The first thing is, look at verse 11, the soil is what grows the sapling.

Do you see that? If I take an acorn and I hold it in my hand, I can walk around for years and years and years. You know what's going to happen?

Nothing. Why? Because it's the soil that gives the power of growth to the acorn or at least opens up the power of growth in the acorn.

It's the soil. It's the nutrients. It's the moisture.

If I just hold on to it, I just walk around all the time with it. Nothing. And verse 11 says, as the soil will finally turn us from ashes, you know, without the soil, eventually the acorn will go to ashes.

If I just carry it around, eventually just fall apart. It has to be planted. So what we're being told is the sovereignty of the Lord.

That word sovereign Lord is pretty unusual. Sovereign means the kingliness of the king. That is the soil in which your soul can grow.

Obedience to him. Now you see, if we only knew that he was the king of the first part of Isaiah and not the king of the second part of Isaiah, I know you couldn't handle it, but a lot of us can't handle it anyway. Let me be real honest.

A lot of you say I would like something from God. I'm afraid to say I submit. I'm afraid to say I surrender.

I'm just afraid. And I know why, because there's a part of your heart that says, if I really, really say to God, anything you say, I will do, anything you send, I'll accept. See, that's submitting.

That's going under the soil. That's putting your soul under the sovereignty of him. To say anything you tell me, no matter how I feel about it, I'll do.

No matter what it looks like, practically, I'll do. And then whatever you send me, I will accept. That's putting yourself underneath the soil.

We're being told it's his kingship that your soul needs. You'll never grow until that happens. The fire will never start to be turned.

The burner won't be turned down until that happens. And you know what, a lot of you are saying, I'm scared to do that. Of course, he might ask me to do something I don't want to do.

Well, of course, Abraham didn't want to take Isaac up the hill. Jesus didn't want to go to the cross. I'm not saying he won't ask you something you don't want to do.

Of course, he's going to do that. But unless Jesus says, unless the seed falls into the ground and dies, it cannot bear fruit. Ironically, the seed can either die underground.

And it becomes something great and beautiful. It can die above ground, but it's going to die one way or the other and you're going to die one way or the other. You can either be your own master and your own Lord.

And you'll go to ashes or you can die to your will. You can die to leading your own life your own way. You want to go under?

I will do whatever you say. Whatever I see your will is I will do no matter what. Whatever you send me, I will accept.

And verse 1 says, the sovereignty of the king. You can trust him. Verse 11 says, the sovereignty of the king.

It will grow you, but the whole passage is saying, but this is the king who went under for you. This is the king who lost everything for you. Think about what you, what might you give up?

If you really say, I am going to give myself to Jesus Christ utterly. Sure you're going to give up some things. You think you're going to give up anything like what he gave up?

He says, if you give up these things, all you're going to give up is this, if you give up your rights, you'll give up your despair. If you give up your rights, you'll give up your ashes. I took your ashes.

You're going to get nothing but beauty from me. I took your morning. You're going to get nothing but co-adness from me.

Don't you see? That's the first thing. The warrior is a nurse.

Go under. That's the first thing. Second thing.

Very important. Unless you see that he's both the suffering servant and the great Lord, you can't become a Christian. You know why?

You see, if you just think of him as this great Lord, I'm going to obey. I'm just going to obey. That's not what makes you a Christian.

What makes you a Christian is verse 10. This is Isaiah beginning to speak. Isaiah actually gives us the prophecy.

It's the Messiah who's speaking. Jesus Christ who's speaking. But when you get down there to verse 8 and 9, suddenly you see, look it.

Suddenly Isaiah begins to speak. He begins to speak about this and here's what Isaiah says. He has robed me.

In fact, I deviated from the NIV. He has wrapped me in a robe of righteousness. What does it mean to become a Christian?

It means to not say, I'm strong enough and I can follow the king. I'll obey. Then I'll get his blessing.

Oh no, no. We have to see it. He's stronger than that.

He's stronger than that. We do not just have a king who comes to this follow me. We have a king who first comes and says, I'm going to die.

I'm going to be everything you need to be. I'm going to substitute for you. So I don't ask you to achieve a righteousness.

I'm going to give you a righteousness. I'm going to plant it in your heart. I'm going to wrap it around your body and your soul.

You're going to get my righteousness, my gladness, see? My beauty. That's what you're going to get.

And so you're not a Christian, if you say, I'm going to try from now on to really live a good life. That's not really dying, by the way. You may think, oh, I'm no longer my own Lord, but you're your own Savior.

And if you're your own Savior, you are your own Lord. You have to willing to say, I give up my rights to my own life because you have done everything for me except me. Oh, Father, for what Jesus has done.

That'll make you a Christian. You've got to put the two together or you can't become a Christian. Thirdly, Christian friends, until you see that he's both the conquering hero, conquering the anointed conqueror and the suffering servant.

You're not going to understand actually even the way he deals with you in your own life. Here's one thing that I know. Sometimes I do something very stupid and God just gets me off the hook.

He just, you know, I say, I did something very stupid. Please help me. And somehow he shields me.

He lets it go, okay, right? So sometimes it's just something really stupid and everything's fine. And other times I do just the tiniest little sort of stupid thing.

And wham, wham, wham, wham. You say, hit me again, Lord. I'm still breathing.

Why would that be? I never forget when I listen to a tape by Dick Lucas on John 11 where Jesus comes to the tomb of Lazarus and two sisters come out to him. Do you remember this?

Martha comes and says, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died. Okay. And like three verses later, Mary comes to him, the other sister and says, if my brother, if you had been here, my brother Lazarus wouldn't have died.

If you look carefully, it's the same words. It's the same spot. It's the same circumstance.

It's the same condition. My goodness. It's the women who their names both start with MA.

I mean, everything's the same. And in the first case, what does Jesus do? He says to Martha, Martha, I am the resurrection in the life.

It's really in the face. I know when we read it, we hear, I am the resurrection in the life. He who, you know, yeah, but look at the context.

He's sort of, he's, he's getting Martha like this. He's really saying, Martha, I am the resurrection in the life. If I had been here, when I'm here, you live.

It doesn't matter when. He said, I am the resurrection in the life. So he's kind of confronting her.

But when Mary comes up, says the same question, makes the same statement, excuse me, comes after him in the same way. What does he do? Do you remember?

He just weeps. See, the first time he gives the ministry of truth and the second time he gives the ministry of tears, one time he just kind of wham and the other time he just listens. Now, you know why?

Because the warrior is a nurse. He is the wonderful counselor. You and I, any, every, some of your counselors, aren't you?

You're not perfect. I know. I've tried so hard to be a perfect counselor.

And here's the problem. Sometimes where I really need to just listen and patient and hold their hand and instead I confront them, doesn't go right. They really need to be listened to.

And other times I listen and listen and listen and listen and I should have confronted them. I mean, I tend to confront when I should be listening. I listen when I should confront.

Sometimes I do the ministry of truth when it should be just the ministry of tears. Other times I do the ministry of tears when I really should be doing a ministry of truth. But Jesus is always spot on.

And that's the only reason why he seems like a schizophrenic to you. Because he knows exactly what you need when you need it. And there's times in which for some reason he just comes in and he sort of lifts the ship and takes you right on through.

And other times he just, other times he seems to completely abandon you. Why? He's the perfect counselor.

He's the warrior and a nurse. He'll change your bedpan. He'll punch you in the chops.

See, nurses very often can't do that or they don't want to do that. They're not that kind of person. And wires, obviously, also can't change bedpounds.

They're not kind of that kind of person. But our savior is the wonderful counselor. See, the wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of Peace, the whole thing.

Fourth. When Jesus Christ preached this text, he says, listen, he gets to the middle of the verse and he says, the year of the Lord's favor. In other words, when Jesus Christ preached this, he got up and he says, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, right?

Because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news of the poor. He has sent me to bind the broken hearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from the darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. And he stopped right in the middle of the sentence, right in the middle of the verse.

And he sat down and he says today, it begins. Well, why didn't he go on to this less part of this passage here? Why in the world didn't he come on and say, and the day of the Lord's vengeance?

What's a matter with Jesus? And here's the answer. It's pretty clear that they're not the same thing.

There's a day of vengeance coming. There's a day of judgment coming. But it's pretty intriguing that Isaiah, the Messiah here in Isaiah says, I've come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance.

That means there's a period of time that's called the Jubilee. But eventually it'll be over and it'll be a day of judgment. And this is really simply what Jesus is saying.

Jesus is saying, not seize the day. Jesus saying the Christians seize the year. Now what's that mean?

It means from now, my first coming to my second coming, I want you to live on the principles of the Jubilee. From what we can tell, when Jesus Christ preached this in the very first time, and he literally said, I've come to declare the Jubilee, there is no indication that he tried to set up a social program in Israel. He didn't say, look, we've got to go back and everybody's got to get their old land, but he didn't do that.

On the other hand, he didn't do that. On the other hand, it is silly to think that he is really talking about his only spiritually. That is not what the text, that's not what Leviticus 25 is like.

And here's my best answer. A New Testament scholar named NT Wright has a really good passage on this in one of his books. And he says, Jesus Christ is calling Christians between the first and second coming of Christ to live themselves on the Jubilee principle.

That means Jesus is coming and saying, my kingdom of God, my kingdom is here partially but not fully. And I want you to begin to sacrifice. I want you to be radically generous with each other.

I want you to forgive each other to your debts. I want you to create a community in which people really lay themselves out for the poor. I want you, a community in which you really lay yourself out for the brokenhearted.

I want you to say because of what you've done for me, I am now going to be working to bind up people in every way. I'm going to try to bring them to Christ spiritually. I'm going to try to bring them together and bind up themselves psychologically.

I'm going to try to bring them up socially and economically. If they're poor, I'm going to do everything I can. Does that mean I'm going to have to be spending money?

I'm going to be giving a lot of my money away. Does it mean I'm going to be involved in people's lives? Yes.

Jesus is not saying Christians get into power and make the Jubilee the program. But that hasn't worked. That's not the point.

It doesn't mean that Christians shouldn't be working for justice in society in general. Yes. But what he is saying is let's not get out from under this.

Christians now redeemer. You right now begin to live on the principles of the Jubilee. That means forgive each other spiritually and also means be unbelievably generous with each other in every way.

让我们谈谈那个。让我们列一个小清单。我们应该如何回应?

第一,请信靠他。现在,这是我在说的。第一件事是,看第11节,土壤是长出树苗的。

你明白吗?如果我拿一颗橡子,我把它握在手里,我可以走来走去很多年很多年。你知道会发生什么吗?

什么都不会。为什么?因为是土壤给橡子成长的力量,或者至少在橡子中打开成长的力量。

是土壤。是养分。是水分。

如果我只是握着它,我只是一直带着它走来走去。什么都不会。第11节说,如土壤最终会使我们从灰尘,你知道,没有土壤,最终橡子会变成灰尘。

如果我只是带着它,最终它只会散架。它必须被种植。所以我们被告知的是主的主权。

那个词"主耶和华"是相当不寻常的。主权意味着君王的君王性。那是你的灵魂可以成长的土壤。

顺服他。现在你看,如果我们只知道他是以赛亚书前半部分的君王而不是以赛亚书后半部分的君王,我知道你无法处理它,但我们很多人无论如何都无法处理它。让我非常诚实。

你们中的很多人说我想从神那里得到一些东西。我害怕说我顺服。我害怕说我降服。

我只是害怕。我知道为什么,因为你内心的一部分说,如果我真的真的对神说,你说什么,我都会做,你差遣什么,我都会接受。看,那就是顺服。

那就是进入土壤下面。那就是把你的灵魂放在他的主权之下。说无论你告诉我什么,无论我对此感觉如何,我都会做。

无论实际上看起来像什么,我都会做。然后无论你差遣我什么,我都会接受。那就是把你自己放在土壤下面。

我们被告知是他的君王性是你的灵魂需要的。你永远不会成长,直到那发生。火焰永远不会开始被关掉。

炉子不会被调小,直到那发生。你知道吗,你们中的很多人在说,我害怕那样做。当然,他可能会要求我做我不想做的事情。

嗯,当然,亚伯拉罕不想把以撒带上山。耶稣不想去十字架。我不是说他不会要求你做你不想做的事情。

当然,他会那样做。但除非耶稣说,除非种子落在地里死了,它不能结果子。讽刺的是,种子可以在地下死去。

它成为伟大和美丽的东西。它可以在地上死去,但它无论如何都会死,你无论如何都会死。你可以成为自己的主人和自己的主。

你会变成灰尘,或者你可以向你的意志死去。你可以向按自己的方式过自己的生活死去。你想进入下面吗?

我会做你说的任何事情。无论我看到你的旨意是什么,无论如何我都会做。无论你差遣我什么,我都会接受。

第1节说,君王的主权。你可以信靠他。第11节说,君王的主权。

它会让你成长,但整段经文都在说,但这是为你进入下面的君王。这是为你失去一切的君王。想想你,如果你真的说,我要把自己完全交给耶稣基督,你可能会放弃什么。

当然你会放弃一些东西。你认为你会放弃任何像他所放弃的东西吗?

他说,如果你放弃这些东西,你要放弃的只是这个,如果你放弃你的权利,你会放弃你的绝望。如果你放弃你的权利,你会放弃你的灰尘。我拿走了你的灰尘。

你将从我这里得到的只有美丽。我拿走了你的早晨。你将从我这里得到的只有欢乐。

你不明白吗?那是第一件事。战士是护士。

进入下面。那是第一件事。第二件事。

非常重要。除非你看到他既是受苦的仆人又是伟大的主,否则你不能成为基督徒。你知道为什么吗?

你看,如果你只是把他看作这位伟大的主,我要顺服。我只是要顺服。那不是使你成为基督徒的。

使你成为基督徒的是第10节。这是以赛亚开始说话。以赛亚实际上给了我们预言。

是弥赛亚在说话。耶稣基督在说话。但当你到达第8和第9节时,突然你看到,看它。

突然以赛亚开始说话。他开始谈论这个,这是以赛亚所说的。他给我披上。

事实上,我偏离了NIV。他用公义袍包裹我。成为基督徒意味着什么?

这意味着不是说,我足够强壮,我可以跟随君王。我会顺服。然后我会得到他的祝福。

哦不,不。我们必须看到它。他比那更强壮。

他比那更强壮。我们不仅仅有一位来说跟随我的君王。我们有一位首先来说,我要死的君王。

我要成为你需要成为的一切。我要为你替代。所以我不要求你取得一个义。

我要给你一个义。我要把它种在你的心里。我要把它包裹在你的身体和灵魂周围。

你会得到我的义,我的欢乐,明白吗?我的美丽。那就是你会得到的。

所以你不是基督徒,如果你说,从现在开始我要尝试真正过一个好的生活。那实际上不是真正的死,顺便说一下。你可能认为,哦,我不再是我自己的主,但你是你自己的救主。

如果你是你自己的救主,你就是你自己的主。你必须愿意说,我放弃我对自己生活的权利,因为你为我做了一切,除了接受我。哦,父啊,为了耶稣所做的。

那会使你成为基督徒。你必须把两者放在一起,否则你不能成为基督徒。

第三,基督徒朋友们,除非你看到他既是征服的英雄,征服的受膏征服者和受苦的仆人,你不会真正理解他在你自己生活中对待你的方式。

这是我知道的一件事。有时我做了一些非常愚蠢的事情,神只是让我摆脱困境。

他只是,你知道,我说,我做了一些非常愚蠢的事情。请帮助我。不知怎么的,他保护我。

他让它过去,好吗,对吗?所以有时只是一些真的很愚蠢的事情,一切都很好。其他时候我只是做了一点点愚蠢的事情。

然后砰,砰,砰,砰。你说,再打我一次,主。我还在呼吸。

为什么会这样?我永远不会忘记当我听迪克·卢卡斯关于约翰福音11章的录音带时,耶稣来到拉撒路的坟墓,两个姐妹来到他面前。你记得这个吗?

马大来说,如果你在这里,我的兄弟拉撒路就不会死。好的。大约三节经文后,马利亚,另一个姐妹来到他面前说,如果我的兄弟,如果你在这里,我的兄弟拉撒路就不会死。

如果你仔细看,是同样的话。是同样的地点。是同样的情况。

是同样的条件。我的天哪。是名字都以MA开头的女人。

我的意思是,一切都一样。在第一种情况下,耶稣做了什么?他对马大说,马大,我是复活,我是生命。

当我们读它时,真的很直接。我知道,我们听到,我是复活,我是生命。那个,你知道,是的,但看看上下文。

他有点,他在,他正在对马大这样。他真的在说,马大,我是复活,我是生命。如果我在这里,当我在这里时,你活着。

什么时候无关紧要。他说,我是复活,我是生命。所以他有点在面对她。

但当马利亚上来时,说同样的问题,做同样的陈述,对不起,以同样的方式来找他之后。他做什么?你记得吗?

他只是哭泣。看,第一次他给予真理的事工,第二次他给予眼泪的事工,一次他有点砰,另一次他只是倾听。现在,你知道为什么吗?

因为战士是护士。他是奇妙的策士。你和我,任何,每个,你们中的一些人是辅导员,不是吗?

你不完美。我知道。我尝试过如此努力成为一个完美的辅导员。

这是问题所在。有时我真的需要只是倾听和耐心并握住他们的手,相反我面对他们,不顺利。他们真的需要被倾听。

其他时候我倾听,倾听,倾听,倾听,我应该面对他们。我的意思是,我倾向于在我应该倾听时面对。我在应该面对时倾听。

有时我在应该只是眼泪的事工时做真理的事工。其他时候我在真的应该做真理的事工时做眼泪的事工。但耶稣总是恰到好处。

这就是为什么他对你来说似乎像精神分裂症的唯一原因。因为他确切地知道你何时需要什么。有些时候不知为何他只是进来,他有点举起船,带你直接穿过。

其他时候他只是,其他时候他似乎完全抛弃你。为什么?他是完美的辅导员。

他是战士和护士。他会换你的便盆。他会在你的下巴上揍你一拳。

你看,护士通常不能那样做,或者他们不想那样做。他们不是那种人。显然,战士也不能换便盆。

他们不是那种人。但我们的救主是奇妙的策士。看,奇妙的策士,全能的神,永在的父,和平的君,整个事情。

第四。当耶稣基督讲这段经文时,他说,听,他到达这节经文的中间,他说,主的恩年。换句话说,当耶稣基督讲这个时,他站起来说,主的灵在我身上,对吗?

因为主用膏膏我,叫我传好消息给贫穷的人。他差遣我医治伤心的人,宣告被掳的得释放,被囚的从黑暗中得释放,宣告主的恩年。他正好停在句子中间,正好停在这节经文中间。

他坐下说,今天,它开始了。好吧,为什么他不继续这段经文的最后一部分?为什么世界上他不继续说,和主报仇的日子?

耶稣怎么了?这是答案。很清楚它们不是同一件事。

有报仇的日子要来。有审判的日子要来。但相当有趣的是,以赛亚,这里的弥赛亚在以赛亚书中说,我来宣告主的恩年和报仇的日子。

这意味着有一段时间被称为禧年。但最终它会结束,会有审判的日子。这真的只是耶稣在说的。

耶稣在说,不是抓住今天。耶稣在说,基督徒抓住这一年。现在那是什么意思?

这意味着从现在,我的第一次降临到我的第二次降临,我要你按照禧年的原则生活。从我们所能知道的,当耶稣基督第一次讲这个时,他字面上说,我来宣告禧年,没有迹象表明他试图在以色列建立一个社会计划。他没有说,看,我们必须回去,每个人都必须拿回他们的旧土地,但他没有那样做。

另一方面,他没有那样做。另一方面,认为他真的只是在属灵上谈论这个是愚蠢的。那不是这段经文,那不是利未记25章的样子。

这是我最好的答案。一位新约学者名叫赖特,在他的一本书中对此有一段非常好的段落。他说,耶稣基督在基督第一次和第二次降临之间呼召基督徒按照禧年原则生活。

这意味着耶稣来说,我的神的国,我的国在这里部分但不完全。我要你开始牺牲。我要你们彼此之间极其慷慨。

我要你们饶恕彼此的债务。我要你们创造一个社区,人们真的为穷人牺牲自己。我要你们,一个社区,你们真的为伤心的人牺牲自己。

我要你们说,因为你为我所做的,我现在要努力以各种方式医治人们。我要尝试在属灵上把他们带到基督面前。我要尝试把他们聚在一起,在心理上医治他们。

我要尝试在社会和经济上提升他们。如果他们贫穷,我要尽我所能。这意味着我要花钱吗?

我要把我很多钱给出去。这意味着我要参与人们的生活吗?是的。

耶稣不是说基督徒掌权并使禧年成为计划。但那没有奏效。那不是重点。

这并不意味着基督徒不应该在社会中为公义工作。是的。但他说的是让我们不要从这下面逃脱。

基督徒现在,救赎主。你现在开始按照禧年的原则生活。这意味着在属灵上彼此饶恕,也意味着以各种方式对彼此难以置信地慷慨。

把彼此带入彼此的家中。
