## 为什么教会必须谈论金钱

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why does the Bible talk about money so much?

How we think about and use our money is one of the most common subjects throughout Scripture. And the Bible tells us something striking. You cannot experience deep spiritual growth without putting your money and your attitude toward it in God's hands. Listen as Tim Keller shows us why generosity is not optional for Christians, but a vital mark of authentic faith. I've been bringing your Gospel of John to church for the last year and a half. You'll have to look over into somebody else's Bible. I'm going to read to you from 2 Corinthians 9.

I'll explain why the detour in a moment. 2 Corinthians 9, verses 6 through 15. Paul's epistle to the Corinthians, his second one, at least the second one we have. And Paul says, As it is written, he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor. His righteousness endures forever.

Now he who supplies seed in the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be made rich in every way so that you may be generous on every occasion. And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. The service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people, but also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the Gospel of Christ and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else. And in their prayers for you, their hearts will go out to you because of the surpassing grace God has given you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift.

This is God's Word. Now, one of the things you can always expect near the end of the year is you've got a lot of special features. You've got Christmas coming and Advent. You've got Thanksgiving. And therefore, we're going to move back and forth and each week you may get a John sermon, you may not.

But we'll finish John up this spring. Now, here's what I'd like to talk about today. I'd like to talk about money. One of the very first things that I learned when I came to New York in figuring out where people were at, I found out that there were a lot of people who that New Yorkers get extremely nervous when ministers talk about money. And part of the reason, partly because of that research that I did, I've stayed away from the subject. And one of the good things is that many people like about the church is that there don't seem to be lots of appeals and canvases and things like that.

But there's an imbalance that can happen and here's why I have to make sure that today I talk about money. It's coming up on Thanksgiving and we're going to budget today to the congregation. It's a traditional time to talk about money in a congregation. Why should I do it?

Why should we do it? For this reason, it's artificial, very artificial, to avoid the subject when A, so many of your problems, I know I listen to them, so many of your worries, so many of your difficulties, so many of the complexities of your life revolve around money. And then secondly, it's artificial because so much of the Bible is about money. It's about money. The Gospel of Luke is almost completely about money if you read it through and see how often it's mentioned. And therefore, it's very artificial to stay away from something that's so central to, in many cases, it's the thing that's really right now been worrying more than anything else.

每到年底，总有一些特别的事情。圣诞节和将临期要来了，还有感恩节。所以接下来几周我们会来回切换，每周你可能会听到约翰福音的讲道，也可能不会。不过我们会在明年春天讲完约翰福音。

今天我想谈的主题是：金钱。

我刚来纽约的时候，在了解大家的想法时，学到的第一件事就是，有很多人——纽约人在牧师谈论金钱的时候会极度紧张。部分原因是基于我做的那些调查研究，我一直在回避这个话题。而很多人喜欢这间教会的一个原因，就是这里似乎没有太多的呼吁和募款之类的事情。

但这样做可能会造成一种失衡，以下就是为什么我今天必须谈论金钱。感恩节就要到了，我们今天要向会众报告预算。在教会中，这是传统上谈论金钱的时间。我为什么应该这样做？

我们为什么应该这样做？原因是这样的：回避这个话题是非常矫揉造作的。首先，你们的许多问题——我知道，因为我一直在倾听——你们的许多忧虑、许多困难、生活中许多的复杂纠结，都与金钱有关。其次，这样回避也是不自然的，因为圣经有大量篇幅在谈论金钱。金钱是圣经的一大主题。如果你通读路加福音，看看金钱被提到的频率，你会发现它几乎整本都在谈论金钱。因此，刻意回避一个如此核心的话题——在很多情况下，这恰恰是你们此刻最为焦虑的事情——是非常不自然的。

所以很显然，我们不能以"对一个对有组织宗教高度不信任的文化保持谨慎和敏感"为借口，特别是在涉及金钱的时候，就回避这个话题，因为你们需要听到这些。圣经说的是：**除非你把你的金钱和你对金钱的态度都交在神的手中，否则你不可能经历真正的属灵成长。**你的生命中不可能有真正的、显著的属灵成长，除非你把你的金钱和你对金钱的看法交在神的手中。因为金钱在你的生命中实在太重要、太关键了。

## 全人医治的比喻

So we obviously can't, in the name of being careful and sensitive to a culture that is very distrustful of organized religion, especially when it comes to money, that we would avoid the subject because you need to hear it. And the Bible says this, there can be no significant spiritual growth unless you put your money and your attitude toward it into God's hands. There can be no significant growth, no significant spiritual growth in your life unless you put your money and what you think about your money into God's hands. Because it's just too big and too pivotal an issue. If you would go to a doctor, and you go because of a general need to improve your health. If you went into a doctor and said, doctor, I am just not healthy. I'm always tired and I'm constantly getting sick.

Can you help me? What would the doctor say?

She would look at would say, listen, you're going to have to tell me everything. Because I can't just give you a physical checkup. You're going to have to tell me how you're sleeping. How well you sleep. How many hours you sleep. You have to tell me what you're eating and how much you're eating. You need to tell me about your work.

How many hours are you working? How satisfying is your work to you?

You have to tell me about personal stresses may be happening in your life. You got to tell me everything. And if you looked at her and said, no, wait a minute, you're a doctor. You stick to the physical.

I don't want to talk to you about my personal stresses. And I don't want to talk to you about the personal problems I have at work. That's not your department. You help me with my health. What would she say?

She'd say, I'm sorry. The answer is, I'm sorry. They're all connected. You can't break your life into departments. Maybe the reason that you're always getting sick is because there's some kind of psychological strain on you. And the physiological effects are real. They're not psychosomatic, but they're being caused by something.

You might need counseling as well as my treatment. And therefore, you got to tell me everything. Of course, that's what the doctor's going to say. And in the same way, God says, you come to me. Because you want meaning. Because you want renewal. Because you want strength.

Because you want forgiveness. You want me in your life. Then you've got to let me talk to you about your money.

假如你去看医生。你因为整体健康状况需要改善而去看医生。假如你走进去对医生说："医生，我就是不健康。我总是觉得累，而且不停地生病。你能帮帮我吗？"医生会怎么说？

她会看着你说："听着，你得把所有情况都告诉我。因为我不能只给你做一个体检就了事。你得告诉我你的睡眠情况，睡得好不好，每晚睡几个小时。你得告诉我你吃什么，吃多少。你需要告诉我你的工作情况——每天工作几个小时？工作让你满意吗？你得告诉我你生活中可能正在经历的个人压力。你得把所有事情都告诉我。"

而如果你看着她说："不，等一下，你是医生。你就管管身体的事吧。我不想跟你谈我的个人压力，我也不想跟你谈我工作上的私人问题。那不是你的管辖范围。你就帮我处理健康问题就好了。"她会怎么说？

她会说："对不起。"答案是："对不起。这些事情都是互相关联的。你不能把你的生活分成一个一个的格子。也许你总是生病的原因，正是因为你承受着某种心理压力。那些生理上的影响是真实的——它们不是心理暗示，但它们可能是由某些原因引起的。你可能需要心理辅导，也需要我的治疗。所以，你得把所有事情都告诉我。"当然，这就是医生会说的话。

同样地，神说：你来到我面前，因为你想要意义，因为你想要更新，因为你想要力量，因为你想要饶恕，你希望我参与到你的生命中。那么，你就必须让我跟你谈论你的金钱。

你看，如果你说："我希望神参与我的生命，但我不想任何人跟我谈论神怎么看金钱"——这是不可能的。就像那位医生最终会让你离开，说："抱歉，你想要的是不可能实现的。你想让我处理你的健康问题，但你又不肯把所有情况告诉我，你不愿意承认你是一个各方面互相关联的整体。"

同样地，神说：除非你愿意跟我谈论你的金钱，除非你愿意把你的金钱和你对金钱的态度也交在我手中，否则我们没法做成这件事。因此，我们必须来看看经文。这就是我们眼前的一段经文。你看到了这其中的实际含义吗？

这是一个非常有力的论证，而且它非常有道理。

## 激进慷慨：真基督徒的标志

You see, if you want, I want God in my life, but I don't want anybody talking to me about what God says about money. That's impossible. And just like the doctor will kick you out after a while and say, I'm sorry. What you want is impossible. You want me to deal with your health, but you won't tell me everything. And you won't see that you're an interconnected person. You won't see that you're an interconnected whole.

In the same way, God says, unless you're willing to talk to me about your money, unless you're willing to put your money and your attitude toward your money in my hands as well, we can't do business. Therefore, we have to take a look at the passages. And here's a passage. I mean, do you see the practical implications of that?

That's a powerful argument. And it makes so much sense. Now, the scripture says, it gives a lot of places where it gives you principles for what it means to put your money in God's hands.

What does that mean, you say? What does the Bible say our attitude has to be?

圣经在许多经文中给出了关于把你的金钱交在神手中意味着什么的原则。那意味着什么呢？圣经说我们的态度应该是什么？

有许多相关的经文，但我们今天要看的是这一段。这段经文告诉我们的是：**真基督徒的标志就是激进的慷慨。**你有没有注意到，当我们读过这段经文时，"慷慨"这个词——慷慨、慷慨、慷慨——出现得多么频繁？

激进的慷慨，令人瞩目的慷慨，这就是基督徒的标志。现在，我想向你们展示，这段经文教导我们三件事：第一，慷慨对我们生命的**影响**——慷慨的效果是什么；第二，慷慨的**动力**——它内在的源泉是什么；第三，慷慨的**衡量标准**——你怎么知道自己是否慷慨？到底给多少？你知道的，底线，这里是纽约嘛，对吧？

慷慨的影响、慷慨的动力、慷慨的衡量标准——让我们来逐一看看，因为这些都在这段经文里。

## 慷慨的双重影响

Well, there's a number of passages, but we're going to look at this one. And what this passage will tell us about is that it's the mark of real Christians to be radically generous. Did you notice as we read through there how often in many verses the word generosity, generosity, generosity comes up?

Radical generosity, remarkable generosity. That's the mark of a Christian. Now, I'd like to show you that this scripture teaches us about the impact of that generosity on our lives. It teaches us about the effects of generosity, what the effects are. Then secondly, the motivation for that generosity. Where does it come from internally?

And then lastly, the measure of that generosity. How do you know that you're generous or not?

How much? You know, bottom line, New York, right?

So the impact of that generosity, the motivation for that generosity, and the measure of that generosity. Let's run through those three things because they're all here. Now, first of all, let's see. I'm going to actually, you know, you could easily turn this around and, but the impact lasts, but I want to put it first because I want you to see the importance of radical Christian generosity for the world.

Paul says, pardon me, I have to keep this in context. Paul in 2 Corinthians is raising money for famine relief. There's hints of passage I read you, but you see it over in 2 Corinthians 8.

There's been a famine in Jerusalem. There's many people there who are in need, and Paul is going to Asia Minor and to the churches in that area, and he is raising money. He's asking for money for the Christians there to give money to do famine relief in Jerusalem. And therefore, if you look carefully, you'll see that Paul is saying the impact of this generosity will be twofold. Not only will there be people who are physically fed, but secondly, we see, for example, in verse 13, radical generosity will also lead people to praise God.

See, there's a twofold impact. There's a twofold impact. There's a twofold impact to radical generosity.

Let me show you what that means and then how radical generosity brings it about. Twofold. Not only does it feed people, but it also leads them to praise God.

首先，让我们来看慷慨的影响。不过我想先把它放在前面，因为我想让你们看到激进的基督徒慷慨对这个世界的重要性。

保罗在哥林多后书中正在为饥荒救济筹款。在我读给你们的这段经文中有一些暗示，但你在哥林多后书第8章能看得更清楚。耶路撒冷发生了饥荒，那里有许多人处于需要之中。保罗正在前往小亚细亚和那一带的教会，他在募集资金。他请求那里的基督徒捐款，为耶路撒冷的饥荒救济提供帮助。

因此，如果你仔细看，你会发现保罗说的是，这种慷慨的影响是双重的。不仅有人会得到身体上的喂养，而且我们看到，例如在第13节，激进的慷慨还会引导人们赞美神。

看到了吗？激进的慷慨有双重影响。让我来解释这意味着什么，以及激进的慷慨如何带来这些效果。双重的：它不仅喂养人的身体，还引导人赞美神。

你看，人有两个部分。你有身体和灵魂，或者说身体和灵。随便你怎么说。你有一个非物质的部分和一个物质的部分。生理学家会告诉你，你就是一袋化学物质。但如果有人告诉你"你只不过是一袋化学物质"，你会一拳揍在他鼻子上。为什么？

因为你知道你不仅仅是化学物质。你知道这一点。坦白说，如果你真的不过是化学物质，那你就有权像对待一袋真正的化学品一样对待一个人。而我们不会像对待其他化学品那样对待人这一事实，恰恰说明我们内心深处相信人有物质的部分和非物质的部分。

在我们身上，有着远超肉眼或显微镜所能看到的东西。你有两个部分。帮助人有许多方式，而教会一直在帮助人的身体。教会一直在喂养人。教会一直在建医院。教会一直在服务老年人和弱势群体。

在这个国家的任何一座城市，如果教会停止做这些事，你知道那些城市的生活质量会立刻受到负面影响。所以显然，教会一直在关怀身体的需要。但教会，不同于其他任何机构，宗教机构能够同时关怀身体——物质的部分——和非物质的部分。因为宗教机构不仅能做喂养、医疗等工作，还能给你生命的意义，告诉你事物的目的是什么。而如果你没有这些，那么所有对身体、物质和肉体的关怀其实都是没有意义的。

## 番茄的比喻：意义的重要性

You see, you are two parts. You are body and soul or body and spirit. You can put it either way.

There's an immaterial part to material part to you. The physiologist will tell you that you are a bag of chemicals. But if somebody tells you you're only a bag of chemicals, you'll punch them in the nose. Why?

Because you know you're more than just chemicals. You know that. If you are, frankly, if you're not more than just chemicals, then you have the right to treat a human being the way you would treat a real bag of chemicals. And the fact that we don't treat human beings the way we treat other bags of chemicals shows implicitly we believe there's a material and an immaterial part.

There's more to us than meets the eye or the microscope. There's two parts to you. Now, there's many ways to help people. And churches have always helped the body. Churches have always fed people. They've always built hospitals. They have always worked with the elderly and the disadvantages.

And in any city in this country where churches stop doing that, you know there'd be an immediately negative impact on the quality of life in those cities. So obviously the church has always dealt with the body, but the church, unlike any other institution, religious institutions, can deal with both the body the material and the immaterial. Because the religious institutions not only can do the feeding and the medical and so on, but they can also give you meaning in life, tell you what the purpose of things is, without which, if you don't have that, all the dealing with the body and the physical and material really is kind of meaningless. For example, what can botanists tell you about a tomato?

---

举个例子，植物学家能告诉你关于番茄的什么？他们能告诉你很多关于番茄的事情，比我知道的多得多。只有一件事他们告诉不了你，而那恰恰是最重要的。他们能告诉你关于番茄的一切，唯独不能告诉你——为什么。为什么会有番茄？

他们回答不了这个问题。你看到这为什么重要了吗？

想想看：这个番茄是创造的美丽杰作呢，还是——请原谅我这么说——它只是一个该死的番茄？这取决于更大的问题。你看，当你看着这个东西的时候，你看到的是充满美感、秩序和对称的事物，是创造的奇迹，是一种喜悦，还是仅仅是一个可以扔掉或砸向别人的东西？

这取决于你是否相信生命有任何意义。关键是，除非你看到那些大问题——我们谈论什么能帮助人——朋友们，如果人们不知道自己为什么活着，如果人们不知道事物的目的是什么，如果人们不知道什么是对什么是错，如果人们不知道自己在宇宙中的位置，如果他们没有那个大图景、那些大问题的答案——如果他们在灵性上没有和在身体上一样得到关怀，那他们就没有真正被关怀到。

## 拉丁美洲的属灵复兴

They can tell you a lot of things about tomatoes. They can tell you a lot more than I know about tomatoes. There's only one thing they can tell you. They can't tell you, and that's the most important thing. They can tell you everything about the tomato, except why. Why the tomato?

They can't tell you about that. Do you see why that's important, though?

Look, is this tomato a beautiful work of creation, or please excuse me, is it a beautiful fruit, or is it just a damn tomato? It depends on the bigger question. See, is this, is this thing when you look at it, do you see something that's full of beauty and order and symmetry, a wonder of creation, a joy, or do you see it as something just to squash or throw at somebody?

It depends on whether you believe there's any meaning in life at all. The point is, unless you see the big issues, we talk about what will help people. Friends, if people don't know why they are living, if people don't know what the purpose of things is, if people don't know how you know what the purpose of things is, if people don't know how you know what the purpose of things is, if people don't know what's right and wrong, if people don't know who they are in the universe, if they don't have both the big picture, the big issues, if they're not dealt with spiritually as well as physically, they're not being dealt with. One of the most important and interesting things that's happening in the world today is what's happening religiously in Latin America. Recently there have been two major studies written by sociologists, not writing from a Christian point of view, not published by Christians, in houses of publication, but two sociologists have written books on the fact that in Latin America the poor are turning to traditional Protestant Christianity in incredible numbers. In Brazil, 500,000 people a year are joining these churches. Guatemala is 30% now evangelical Protestant.

Now let me tell you what I mean by traditional Protestant. I mean this. That is, traditional Christianity without the modern bias against the supernatural, up until 50 years ago, this is what all Christians believed, and still, traditional Christians believe this. They believe in the supernatural. The modern mind has faith that there is no supernatural, but that can't be proven. It's a bias. It's not objective.

It's a faith assumption. Traditional Christians have always believed that the Bible is God's revelation. It's a miracle. It's God's word. That there is such a thing as a new birth, that Christ can come on in and change you from the inside. That he can live with you and give you power.

That the kingdom of God can move into our lives and give us power to change lives and social structures. And those are the kind of churches that the poor are flooding into in Latin America. Lots of people have been trying to help the poor in Latin America in all kinds of very important ways. Extremely important ways. Community development and hunger relief and so on.

But the poor themselves, the kind of help the poor are getting themselves is they're flooding into these churches. You know why?

These two sociologists have written these two different books independently of each other and they say that classic Christianity is radically empowering. What the poor realize when they get a hold of the gospel is that whether you're high or low socially, we're all sinners. And then secondly, no matter who you are socially, in Christ, every human being has equal dignity before the Father.

See, that's radically empowering. It's radically democratic. You might say, it's democratic. It's radicalizing.

当今世界正在发生的最重要、最有趣的事情之一，就是拉丁美洲在宗教方面发生的变化。最近有两项重要研究，由社会学家撰写——不是从基督教的角度写的，也不是由基督教出版社出版的——但这两位社会学家写了关于这样一个事实的书：在拉丁美洲，穷人正在以惊人的数量转向传统的新教基督教。在巴西，每年有50万人加入这些教会。危地马拉现在30%的人口是福音派新教徒。

我来解释一下我说的"传统新教"是什么意思。就是这样的：传统的基督教信仰，没有现代人对超自然事物的偏见。在50年前，这是所有基督徒都相信的，而今天传统的基督徒仍然这样相信。他们相信超自然。现代人的信念是没有超自然的存在，但这一点是无法证明的。这是一种偏见。这不是客观的。这是一个信仰假设。

传统的基督徒一直相信圣经是神的启示，是一个神迹，是神的话语。相信有新生这回事——基督能够进入你的内心，从里面改变你。他能与你同在，赐给你能力。相信神的国度能够进入我们的生命，赐给我们改变生命和社会结构的能力。

而这正是穷人在拉丁美洲蜂拥而入的那种教会。有很多人一直在用各种非常重要的方式帮助拉丁美洲的穷人，极其重要的方式——社区发展、饥荒救济等等。但穷人自己呢，穷人自己正在寻求的那种帮助，就是涌入这些教会。你知道为什么吗？

这两位社会学家各自独立地写了这两本不同的书，他们说，正统的基督教信仰具有激进的赋能作用。穷人在抓住福音的时候认识到的是：无论你的社会地位是高是低，我们都是罪人。其次，无论你的社会地位如何，在基督里，每一个人在天父面前都拥有平等的尊严。

你看，这是激进的赋能。这是激进的民主。你可能会说，这是民主的。这是激进的变革性力量。这是那些书中实际说的。通过基督教信仰，他们获得了面对当下的力量和对未来的盼望，这意味着他们能够面对自己的生活。当整个村庄都归向基督的时候，家庭就凝聚在一起，经济状况也随之改变。因为，你看，这些人正是那个根本问题——大问题——得到了回应。

教会能做的不仅仅是喂养人，它还能引导人赞美神。而事实是，除非你有值得赞美的对象，你的生命就没有意义。一个饱腹的肚子是不够的。你难道看不出来吗？

## 激进慷慨如何改变罗马帝国

That's what they say, actually, in the books. And the fact that through Christianity, they got power for the present and hope for the future means they're able to face their lives. And where there are whole villages that are coming to Christ, what happens is families come together and the economic conditions change. Because, you see, these people are having the big issue addressed. Not simply. What the church can do is not simply feed people, but it can lead them to praise God. And the fact is, unless you've got something to praise, you've got no meaning in your life.

And a full stomach is not enough. Don't you see?

You say, what does the world need? What does the world need?

Paul was in the Roman world. And the old religions and philosophies of that ancient world were disintegrating because they couldn't bear the freight of people's real meaning needs. The church came in, it could do it all. It could feed people and it could lead them to praise God. And it ran through the Roman Empire like lightning. Do you see how it changed things?

It changed things radically. And here's how it changed things. It changed things through radical generosity.

A lot of people say, well, it's fascinating. How did Christianity actually move through the Roman Empire and change it the way it's moving through cultures today?

Wherever the church spreads, in New Testament purity, it changes everything. It addresses both the body and the soul, both the material and the immaterial. And only religious institutions can do that. And the only ones that can actually do it, they have to multiply.

There is nothing, for example, there would be nothing better for New York City than in the next 10 years to have 2,000 new churches planted. That's the rate that things are being planted in parts of Latin America and parts of Korea. There is nothing that could possibly change people's lives.

There is nothing that could possibly change people's lives physically, completely, you see, physically and spiritually, than a church. There is nothing more important to spread than that. Now, how does it happen?

你说，这个世界需要什么？这个世界需要什么？

保罗处在罗马帝国时代。那个古老世界的旧宗教和哲学正在瓦解，因为它们无法承载人们真正的意义需求。教会进来了，它什么都能做到。它能喂养人，也能引导人赞美神。它像闪电一样传遍了整个罗马帝国。你看到它如何改变了一切吗？

它彻底地改变了一切。而改变的方式是什么？就是通过激进的慷慨。

很多人说，太不可思议了，基督教到底是怎么传遍罗马帝国、并像今天在各种文化中传播那样改变了它？无论教会以新约的纯正形式在哪里传播，它都改变一切。它同时关怀身体和灵魂，同时关怀物质的和非物质的。只有宗教机构能做到这一点。而那些真正能做到的，它们必须不断地增长繁殖。

举例来说，对纽约来说，没有什么比在未来十年建立2000间新教会更好的事了。这是目前拉丁美洲和韩国部分地区教会建立的速度。没有任何事情能比一间教会更完全、更彻底地改变人们的生命——身体上和灵性上。没有什么比教会更值得传播的了。

那么，这是怎么发生的？

它通过激进的慷慨来传播。听着。当教会成为它应当成为的样子时，教会中人们的生命就有一种磁力和吸引力，能吸引人们前来，而激进的慷慨就是关键。

在最后一位使徒——使徒约翰去世后二三十年，有一份非常古老的基督教文献，我们不知道作者是谁，但它被称为《致丢格那妥书》。丢格那妥是一位非基督徒，有人写信给他，试图解释基督教。信中说的非常有意思。它说，让我告诉你为什么基督教传播得如此之快：

"基督徒忙碌于地上的事务，但他们的国籍却在天上。"

请仔细听："他们住在自己的祖国，却如同寄居者一般生活；因为对他们来说，每一个异乡都是故乡，每一个故乡都是异乡。他们结婚生子，但他们不杀害不想要的婴儿。他们与所有人共享筵席，但不与所有人共享床榻。他们爱所有人，却被所有人逼迫。他们贫穷，却使许多人富足。他们一无所有，却样样都有。他们被人欺凌，却以恭敬相待。他们被人嘲笑，却以祝福回报。他们行善时遭受攻击。他们被攻击时却满心欢喜，仿佛得到了新生命。"

## 早期基督徒改变世界的四种品质

It spreads through radical generosity. Listen. When the church becomes what it ought to be, there is a magnetism and an attractiveness about people's lives in the church that attracts people, and radical generosity is a key. 20 or 30 years after the last apostle died, after John the Apostle died, there was a, we don't know who wrote this, but we have a very, very ancient Christian document, and it's called the Episcopal to Diognetus. Diognetus was a non-Christian, and somebody wrote him a letter saying, trying to explain Christianity, and this is what it says, and it's very interesting. It says, let me tell you why Christianity is spreading so fast. Christians busy themselves on earth, but their citizenship is in heaven.

Listen real carefully. They live in their own native land, but they live as aliens, for every foreign country is to them as their native land, and every native land is as their foreign country. They marry and have children, but they do not kill unwanted babies. They are poor, oh, pardon me, they share their table with everyone, but they don't share their bed with everyone. They love everyone, but are persecuted by all. They are poor and make many rich. They are short of everything, and yet have plenty of everything.

They are treated outrageously, but behave respectfully. They are mocked and blessed in return. When they do good, they are attacked. When they are attacked, they rejoice as if being given new life.

Now look and see, for a moment, four qualities that these Christians had that everyone marveled at. The first one was the complete absence of racism. It says, their foreign countries were as their native lands, and their native lands were as their foreign countries.

See what that means? I have to run through these more briefly. You see, the Christians were Jews and Africans and Greeks and Romans, but they were Christians first, and they were Greeks and Jews and Romans and Africans second. What Christianity does is it gives you a higher authority than your cultural tradition, and it gives you a higher loyalty than your race. It relativizes your relationship to your own culture so that you can critique it, and it says your Christians could appreciate other people's cultures and they could be critical of their own. They no longer took their identity from who they were racially, and it cut racism down at the root.

See, their native lands were as their foreign lands, and their foreign lands were as native lands. So the absence of racism. Secondly, a high, high view of life. It says they do not kill the unwanted. Back then, it was normal that when you had a female child, to throw it in the river, and parents had the right to do that. Slaves also were expendable. You could kill a slave if you wanted to.

Christians, though, saw every life, no matter how unwanted or expendable, to be absolutely inviolate, infinitely precious. That view of life.

Thirdly, they had an unusual view of sex. The third reason that people looked at them as so strange was because it says they share their table with all, but they don't share their bed with all. You see, the pagan understanding of sex was like an appetite. You know, if you got hungry, you ate, and if you felt sexy, you had sex. Christians came along and said, with an absolutely radical sex ethic, and what they said is, sex is God's appointed way to say to another human being, I belong completely and exclusively and permanently to must not be used, sex must not be used to say anything else to someone.

Therefore, sex was a celebration of complete, exclusive, and permanent commitment. What was so interesting was every single one of the early Christians had been raised in the pagan sex ethic, and when they became Christians, and they realized the new Christian sex ethic, they felt liberated. What's ironic is, in most cases, you were raised in the Christian sex ethic, and were told that it's the pagan one that's liberated. And how did you find it?

You know, when Christians are raised in the pagan one, they get into Christian, the Christian sex ethic, they find intimacy, they find healing, they find security. When you come up in the Christian sex ethic, and you get rid of pagan, how liberated are you?

How excited are you? How happy are you?

You see, the Christian sex ethic ran through the Roman Empire like lightning. It was so unique, and when people tried it, they said, this is it. But fourthly, these early Christians were radically generous. It says, they share their table with everyone. Though poor, they make many rich. And though they have nothing, they're short of everything, they have plenty of everything. And what that's saying is, these early Christians were marked by eye-popping generosity.

They were radically generous. People couldn't believe how quick they were to give their money away to people. And not only that, they changed their attitude toward their simpler lifestyle that they had as a result. It says, though short of everything, they had plenty of everything.

What does that mean? It means that they were short of things because they were so generous, and yet they were happy with what they had. Why, how could the Roman Empire, with its slavery and its infanticide, and its corruption and its decadence and its immorality, you know, you saw I, Claudius, along with me, how did a world like that turn Christian within a couple hundred years?

How could Christianity have just spread the way it did? The answer is, nobody could match the beauty of the lives of these Christians. Their lifestyle was gorgeous. Their lifestyle was startling. A lack of racism, a high regard for human life, a sex ethic of purity and commitment, and lastly, radical generosity. People looked at Christians and said, what has happened inside of them to make them so quick to give their money away?

They've never seen anything like it. Nobody can figure it out. Something radical must have happened on the inside, and that's true.

现在来看，这些基督徒有四种品质让所有人都惊叹不已。

**第一种是完全没有种族歧视。**信上说："他们的异乡于他们如同故乡，他们的故乡于他们如同异乡。"你看到这意味着什么吗？我得简要地过一下这些。你看，这些基督徒有犹太人、非洲人、希腊人和罗马人，但他们首先是基督徒，其次才是希腊人、犹太人、罗马人和非洲人。基督教给了你一个高于你文化传统的权威，给了你一个高于你种族的效忠对象。它相对化了你与自己文化的关系，使你能够批判性地审视它。它让基督徒能够欣赏其他民族的文化，同时也能反思自己的文化。他们不再从种族身份中获取自我认同，这从根本上铲除了种族主义。

你看——他们的故乡于他们如同异乡，异乡于他们如同故乡。所以，第一是没有种族歧视。

**第二是对生命极高的尊重。**信上说，他们不杀害不想要的孩子。在那个时代，生了女孩就把她扔进河里是很正常的事，父母有权这样做。奴隶也是可以随意处置的——如果你愿意，你可以杀掉一个奴隶。但基督徒认为每一个生命，无论多么"不受欢迎"或"可有可无"，都是绝对不可侵犯的，是无限宝贵的。这就是他们对生命的看法。

**第三，他们有一种不同寻常的性观念。**人们觉得他们奇怪的第三个原因，是信上说他们"与所有人共享筵席，但不与所有人共享床榻"。你看，异教对性的理解就像对待食欲一样。你饿了就吃，你有性冲动就去满足。基督徒带来了一种绝对激进的性伦理，他们说的是：性是神所设立的方式，用来对另一个人说——我完全地、排他地、永远地属于你。性不可以被用来向别人传达任何其他信息。

因此，性是对完全、排他、永久委身的庆祝。最有意思的是，每一位早期基督徒都是在异教的性观念中长大的，当他们成为基督徒、接受了新的基督教性伦理之后，他们感到的是释放和自由。讽刺的是，在大多数情况下，你是在基督教性伦理中长大的，却被告知异教的那套才是解放。结果你发现了什么呢？

你知道，当那些在异教观念中长大的基督徒进入基督教的性伦理时，他们找到了亲密、找到了医治、找到了安全感。而当你从基督教性伦理中长大，然后抛弃它去拥抱异教的那一套，你有多"自由"呢？你有多兴奋呢？你有多快乐呢？

你看，基督教的性伦理在罗马帝国中像闪电一样传开了。它是如此独特，当人们尝试之后，他们说：就是这个了。

**第四，这些早期基督徒是激进地慷慨的。**信上说，他们与所有人共享筵席。虽然贫穷，他们却使许多人富足。他们一无所有，却样样都有。这段话说的是，这些早期基督徒以令人瞠目结舌的慷慨著称。

他们是激进地慷慨的。人们简直不敢相信他们把钱给别人给得有多快。不仅如此，他们对因此而过上更简朴生活的态度也完全改变了。信上说："虽然他们一无所有，却样样都有。"

这意味着什么？意味着他们因为太过慷慨而缺乏很多东西，但他们对自己所拥有的却心满意足。

罗马帝国，有着奴隶制、杀婴、腐败、堕落和不道德——你知道的，你跟我一样看过《我，克劳狄》——像那样的一个世界，怎么可能在几百年之内变成基督教世界？基督教怎么可能就那样传播开来？

答案是：没有人能比得上这些基督徒生命的美。他们的生活方式是华美的，他们的生活方式是令人震撼的。没有种族歧视、高度尊重生命、纯洁委身的性伦理，以及激进的慷慨。人们看着基督徒说：他们内心到底发生了什么，能让他们如此迅速地把钱给出去？

他们从没见过这样的事。没有人能想明白。他们内心一定发生了某种激进的改变——而这确实是事实。

## 慷慨的动力：创造与救赎

Now, let's look at what that is. It's the motivation. But before we do, just for a second, let me point this out.

How do people look at you? How do people look at us?

Is the gospel spreading like lightning through New York because people look at folks that come here and say, man, do they say the same things about us as they used to say about the early Christians and their money? Do they say when you get near Christians, you get showered with their time, with their funds, and with their open homes?

They just give you help in the most practical way possible. They are so generous. Does anybody say that about you?

Are you unusually generous? Are you known for your generosity?

If not, you're not like they were. And maybe it's because you don't have the same thing operating inside that was operating inside of them. What was operating inside of them?

You know what their motivation was? It's right there in verse 13 again. It says, Something had happened inside of them.

See, a motivation is a motor. It's something that drives you. What is so unique in Christians that it leads them to a generosity that other people can't account for?

Now, I've already gotten by the fact that that radical generosity has got to be there. Now we look and see why. There are two motives operating in a Christian that makes them different than other people and changes their attitude toward their wealth and their possessions. Listen.

The first one is creation, and the second one is redemption. The first motivation is this. It says, for example, it says, God is able to make all grace available, He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food can also supply and increase your store of seed.

现在，让我们来看看那到底是什么。这就是慷慨的动力。但在此之前，让我先指出这一点。

别人怎么看你？别人怎么看我们？

福音是否像闪电一样正在传遍纽约，因为人们看着来这里的人说——天哪，他们说的关于我们的话，和当年人们对早期基督徒和他们金钱态度说的话一样吗？当你靠近基督徒的时候，是否会被他们的时间、他们的金钱和他们敞开的家门所淹没？他们以最实际的方式给你帮助，他们是那么慷慨。有谁这样说过你吗？

你是不是异常地慷慨？你是不是以慷慨闻名的？

如果不是，你就不像他们那样。也许这是因为你的内心没有当年运作在他们里面的同一种力量。他们里面运作着什么？

你知道他们的动力是什么吗？就在第13节。经文说：有什么东西在他们内心发生了。

你看，动力（motivation）就是一个发动机（motor）。它是驱动你的东西。基督徒身上有什么独特之处，以至于使他们产生了别人无法解释的慷慨？

我们已经确认了激进的慷慨必须存在。现在我们来看看为什么。在基督徒内心有两种动力在运作，使他们与其他人不同，改变了他们对财富和财物的态度。请听。

**第一种是创造，第二种是救赎。**

第一种动力是这样的。经文说，例如：

> "神能将各样的恩惠多多地加给你们，使你们凡事常常充足，能多行各样善事。"
> ——哥林多后书 9:8

> "那赐种给撒种的，赐粮给人吃的，必多多加给你们种地的种子。"
> ——哥林多后书 9:10

保罗说的是：你之所以需要把财富给出去，是因为你所拥有的一切财富本来就是从神而来的。我知道广告会说："花在自己身上吧，因为你辛苦赚来的。你值得拥有。"你有没有注意到有多少广告基本上都在说这句话？

你值得拥有，因为你赚来的。神说的是什么呢？你赚来的——用什么赚来的？

你赚来的是靠着呼吸我白白给你的空气，靠着我白白给你的头脑，靠着我白白给你的人脉关系。这一切都是从我而来的。你出生在今天而不是1200年前的西藏山区，这是因为我。你所拥有的一切都是我对你的良善的结果。每一分每一毫。现在我请你与人分享。

你看，基督徒对自己财物的态度完全不同，因为他们知道一切都来自神。

## 父亲与孩子的比喻

Now, what he's saying is this. The reason you need to give away your wealth is because all the wealth you got is from God anyway. I know the advertisements say, spend this on yourself because you've worked hard for owe it to yourself. Have you ever noticed how many commercials basically say that?

You owe it to yourself because you've earned it. What God says is, you've earned it with what?

You've earned it breathing the air that I've given you free, with the mind that I gave you free, with the connections that I gave you free. All these things are for me. The fact that you're born today instead of 1,200 years ago in the mountains of Tibet, that's for me. Everything you've got is a result of my goodness to you. Every single bit of it. And I ask you now to share it.

You see, a Christian has a completely different attitude toward their possessions because they know it's all from God. Parents are always irked about this in children. You've got to teach this to children. You buy the children a $50 Nintendo game. And everybody says, Daddy, thank you. Then you sit down and after they've been playing for an hour, you sit down and say, hey, can I play a game?

No. Why?

It's mine. You gave it to me. You buy the kid a candy bar and you say, could I just have a piece?

No, it's mine. And you look at them and you say, you're kidding, right?

You're kidding. It's yours. I know it's yours. I gave it to you. Yeah, it's yours. I'm not taking it back, but come on. Suppose somebody gave you a house.

In the Burbs. $400,000 house. And they say there's only one thing.

---

在孩子身上，这种心态总是让父母感到恼火。你得教导孩子明白这一点。你给孩子买了一个50美元的任天堂游戏。每个人都说："爸爸，谢谢你！"然后你坐下来，等他们玩了一个小时之后，你坐过去说："嘿，我能玩一下吗？"

"不行。"为什么？

"这是我的。你给我的。"你给孩子买了一根糖果，你说："能给我掰一小块吗？"

"不，这是我的。"你看着他们说："你在开玩笑吧？"

你在开玩笑。这是你的。我知道是你的——是我给你的。对，是你的，我不是要拿回来，但拜托。假设有人送给你一栋房子，在郊区，价值40万美元的房子。他们说只有一个条件。

你看它有多大，有这么多房间。我只想有一个房间住，其余全给你。整栋房子都是你的。我有一个单独的空间。我不会太打扰你。我只是想要其中一部分。

你会怎么说？"想都别想！你给了我，那就全是我的。"

你知道，常识会告诉你：如果你在这栋房子里拥有的一切快乐和舒适，完全是因为这一个人的慷慨——完全是因为这一个人的慷慨——而如果这个人说："但是我希望你分享，比如说，10%的房子给我"，常识告诉你，这是一个完全合理的要求。常识告诉那个小孩也应该知道这个道理，但他不懂。"你在开玩笑吧？"

而神在圣经中说，如果他说——如果他说：我给了你所拥有的一切，但是把其中的，比如说，10%分享给我怎么样？用于教会的事工，用于帮助穷人，用于你周围有需要的人，只要10%。我给了你一切，我只是希望你与我分享10%。你说什么？"这是我的！"他对你说："你在开玩笑吧？"

你在开玩笑。

> "使你与人不同的是谁呢？你有什么不是领受的呢？若是领受的，为何自夸，仿佛不是领受的呢？"
> ——哥林多前书 4:7

因此，你怎么敢把这一切当作不是恩赐来对待呢？基督徒明白这一点。尽管基督徒也知道，人天然的内心就像小孩子的心一样，会说："这是我的。"

## 救赎的动力：福音如何改变一切

Look how big it is. It's got all these rooms. I would like to have one room to live in, but I'll give you everything else. The whole house is yours. I'll have a separate. I won't bother you too much. I just would like part of it.

What do you say? Forget it! If you give it to me, it's all mine.

Now, you know, common sense would tell you that if the only reason you have any joy and comfort in that house is because of the generosity, completely the generosity of this one person, if that person says, but I would like you to share, oh, say, 10% of the house with me, common sense says that you ought to know that that's perfectly a reasonable request. Common sense says the little kid should know it too, but he doesn't. You're kidding, right?

And God comes to scripture, and if he would say, if he would say, I've given you everything that you have, but how about sharing with me, oh, say, 10% of work of the church, for the needs of the poor, and for the needs of people around you, just 10%, I've given you everything, I would just like you to share 10% with me, and you say, what? It's mine! And he says to you, you're kidding, right?

You're kidding. 1 Corinthians 4, 7 says, what do you have that is not a gift?

And therefore, how dare you treat it as if it's anything but a gift? Christians understand that. Even though Christians also know the natural heart says, like the heart of a little child says, it's mine.

---

所以，创造是第一种动力，但救赎是第二种。经文说这是对福音的回应。那么，福音是什么？

你知道，经文说，例如在第8章：

> "我说这话，不是吩咐你们，乃是借着别人的热心试验你们爱心的实在。"
> ——哥林多后书 8:8

保罗说：我不是命令你们去给予。但我知道你们认识福音的恩典。现在想想这一点。经文甚至在第13节说，你们通过这份礼物证明了你们自己。

保罗实际上在说：你知道自己是否真正经历了神的恩典的方式，就是看你是否激进地慷慨。不仅如此——保罗实际上在说：如果你需要被命令才去给予，你就从未经历过神的恩典。另一方面，如果你渴望慷慨地、激进地给予，如果你对财物的态度已经被强有力地改变了，那恰恰是你真正经历了神恩典的证据之一——实际上是为数不多的证据之一。

路德说，基督徒是这样一个人：每天早上起来看着神说："耶稣——主啊，你是我的良善，而我是你的刑罚。你承担了我所应得的一切，现在我得到了你所配得的一切。"路德说，每天基督徒都是一个起来就说"我是富足的"的人。

我是富足的。我已经被收养进入了这个家庭。我已经在爱子里被接纳。我有保证将来要永远与他一同作王掌权。他的圣灵大能活在我里面，必将不可避免地胜过我所有的缺陷、所有的软弱、所有的悲伤。基督徒是一个感到自己绝对富足的人，因此转过身来，对你的财物有了完全不同的态度。

## 司布真的比喻：无价的药

So creation is the first motivation, but redemption is the second one. It says here that it's a response to the gospel. Now, what is the gospel?

You know, it says, for example, in chapter 8, I am not commanding you to give, Paul says, but I know that you know the grace of the gospel. Now, think about this for a minute. It even says in verse 13, you've proved yourselves through this gift.

Paul is actually saying, the way you know that you have actually experienced the grace of God is if you're radically generous. And would not... Paul is actually saying, if you need to be commanded, if you're commanded to give, you have never experienced the grace of God. If, on the other hand, you want to give generously, radically, if your attitude toward your possessions has been mightily changed, that is the only proof you've got, actually, one of the few proofs you have, that you really have experienced the grace of God. Luther says that a Christian is somebody who every day gets up and looks at God and says, Jesus, and says, Lord, you are my goodness, and I'm your punishment. You took everything I deserve, and now I get everything you deserved. Luther says every day a Christian is somebody who gets up and says, I'm rich.

I am rich. I've been adopted into the family. I've been accepted into the beloved. I have a guarantee to rule and reign forever. I've got his holy power living in me that will inevitably overwhelm all my flaws, all my weaknesses, all my sadnesses. A Christian is somebody who feels absolutely rich and therefore turns around and says, has a completely different attitude toward your possessions.

There is no... This is an illustration that some of you heard. I got it from Charles Spurgeon.

---

这里有一个比喻，你们中有些人听过。我从司布真（Charles Spurgeon）那里得来的。

司布真，那位老派的浸信会传道人，曾经说：假设你知道自己正因某种疾病而濒临死亡，而我有一种药能确保治好你。你说："我想买那种药。"我说："好，如果你去找经销商，它极其昂贵，你可能得卖掉你的房子，你可能得卖掉你的唱片收藏。你可能得失去一切才买得起。"你会怎么说？

你会说："如果我没有那药，我的房子有什么用？如果我没有那药，我的唱片收藏有什么用？"

这东西太珍贵了。这药太珍贵了，以至于其他那些一向对我来说很重要、看起来很昂贵的东西，现在都显得微不足道了。那药的珍贵使我生命中其他一切都变得——可以舍弃。

圣经说，对你们这些信的人来说，耶稣基督是宝贵的。对你们这些知道他为你做了什么的人来说，你对其他一切事物的态度是这样的——你说：看看我所拥有的。其他一切都可以舍弃。我生命中的其他一切，在永恒的意义上，完完全全可以舍弃。

---

## 爱的语言与慷慨

There's no better illustration than this. Charles Spurgeon, the old Baptist preacher, used to say, what if you knew you were dying of something and I had a medicine that could cure you for sure?

And you said, I want to buy that medicine. And you said, well, if you go to the... If you go to the distributor, it's extremely expensive and you might have to lose your home and you might have to lose your record collection. You might have to lose everything in order to buy it. What would you say?

You would say, what good is my home if I don't have that? What good is my record collection if I don't have that?

This thing is so precious. This medicine is so precious that all these other things that always were important to me that seemed very expensive to me look cheap. The preciousness of that medicine has made everything else in my life expensive. Expendable.

The Bible says, to you who believe, Jesus Christ is precious. To you who know what he's done for you, your attitude toward everything else is this. You say, look at what I have. Everything else is expendable. Everything else in my life is eternally and utterly expendable. You know you're in love with somebody when you want to give them everything. You know, I know there's an awful lot of efforts being made on the part of people who are nervous.

---

你知道自己爱上一个人了，当你想把一切都给他的时候。你知道，我知道有很多人在紧张兮兮地做这件事——在结婚之前签一份小协议，说如果我们离婚了，你不能拿这个，你不能拿那个。也许在某些情况下这么做是明智的，我不确定。但我知道，这不是恋爱中的心的语言。因为当你在一个温暖而热情的拥抱中时，你知道你想说什么吗？

你说："我是你的，我所拥有的一切都是你的。"

这就是你如何辨别自己与神的关系：是一种建立在经历基督恩典之上的爱的关系，还是一种形式化的、律法主义的、道德主义的关系——认为因为你已经尽力了，神就欠你的。

你看，一个真正的基督徒说："我欠你一切。我所拥有的一切都是你的。我对我每一样财物的态度都已经改变了。"

一个道德主义者说："神欠我的。我很努力了。我一直是个好人。"

看到区别了吗？这就是为什么保罗能走到这么远的地步说：你们证明了你们自己。你们证明了你们自己。你们通过激进的慷慨证明了你们自己。你明白了吗？

## 认识恩典的诊断方式

So before they get married, they sign a little agreement saying, if we get a divorce, you don't get this and you don't get that. And maybe in some cases, I don't know if that's wise or not, but I know that's not the language of the heart in love. Because when you're in a warm, passionate embrace, you know what you want to say?

You say, I am yours and everything I have is yours. Here's how you know whether you've got a love relationship based on an experience of the grace of Christ or whether you've got a formal, legalistic, moralistic relationship with God. Thinking that because you've done your best, He owes you.

See, a person who's a real Christian says, I owe you everything. Everything I have is yours. My attitude toward every bit of my possessions has been changed.

A person who's a moralist says, God owes me. I've worked pretty hard. I've worked hard. I've been a good person.

See the difference? And that's the reason why Paul can go so far in saying, you've proved yourself. You've proved yourself. You've proved yourself with radical generosity. Do you understand that?

And here, just before we finish, there's probably people in this room who don't know where they stand with Jesus. They don't know what your relationship is. I want you to know that one of the great glories of the church and one of the great comforts of my life is to know that every week there's a significant number of people here like that. Jesus wants you here.

---

在结束之前，这个房间里可能有些人不知道自己与耶稣的关系在哪里。你不知道你们的关系是什么。我想让你知道，教会最大的荣耀之一，也是我生命中最大的安慰之一，就是知道每周都有相当数量这样的人在这里。耶稣希望你在这里。

耶稣说：我是医生。不是健康的人需要我，我需要的是病人。不是那些灵性坚固的人我要跟他们说话，而是那些困惑的、不知道自己信什么的人。他希望看到你在这里。他是医生。

但这就是他帮助你自我诊断的方式。你自我诊断的方法就是：你觉得激进的慷慨有道理吗？

你看，如果他是他所宣称的那位神，如果他已经把自己给了你，如果他被钉在十字架上来偿付你的债，如果他现在在灵里活在你里面，如果他不仅是你的帮助者而是你的救主——一位为你做了一切的人，他是你的良善，你是他的刑罚——你难道看不出来这会改变你对其他一切事物的态度吗？

当你看到他为你所做的一切，它会改变你对所有财物的态度。这件事发生在你身上了吗？

如果还没有，你就还没有抓住神的恩典。所以继续寻求。朝那个方向前进。如果我现在说的这些话，或者即将在结语中说的话，对你来说毫无道理，那是因为——先不要担心金钱的问题。需要先理顺的是你与他的关系。如果你与他的关系理顺了，激进的慷慨就不成问题。如果你觉得激进的慷慨非常困难，那么你与他的关系还没有理顺。

## 慷慨的衡量标准：十一奉献

Jesus says, Jesus says, I'm a physician. And it's not the well, who I need, I need the sick. It's not the people who are spiritually solid that I want to talk to. It's the people who are confused and who don't know what they believe. He wants to see you here. He's a physician.

But here's how he can help you diagnose yourself. The way you can diagnose yourself is, do you find radical generosity making sense?

See, if he's the God he claimed to be, and if he has given himself to you, and if he was torn on the tree to pay your debt, and now he lives spiritually in you, and if he's not just your helper, but your savior, somebody who did everything for you, he's your goodness, you're his punishment. Don't you see that that will change your attitude toward everything else?

When you see what he's done for you, it changes your attitude toward all your possessions. Has that happened to you yet?

If not, you haven't grasped the grace of God. So keep on. Move toward that. If the things that I'm saying now, or about to say, here in conclusion, make no sense to you, it's because, don't worry about money for the time being. It's your relationship with him that's got to be straight. If your relationship with him is straight, if it gets straight, there's no problem in being radically generous. If you find a lot of trouble with it, then you haven't got it straight.

Last thing. A lot of people say, and I'll just mention this, a lot of people say, well, how much are you talking about?

I don't know if I'm radically generous or not. Let's be bottom line about this. The answer is right there in verse 13, in accord with the gospel.

You see, the gospel comes, in the Old Testament, all believers were required to give one-tenth of their income to God, to the poor, to, in other words, 10% away, not for you, for other people. When you come to the New Testament, there's no place where the tithe is directly commanded. And so everybody starts to go, until you realize, what it's saying is, think of the gospel. Are people in the New Testament who know Christ more blessed or less blessed than people in the Old Testament?

Are you more indebted to God or less indebted to God? And the only inescapable conclusion is, the Bible gives you a pragmatic way to understand whether or not you are a sinner saved by grace. If when you look at 10% and you realize the Bible sees that as a minimum amount, a minimum rule of thumb for how much you should be giving away, a person who's a moralist or a legalist will say, that's ridiculous.

But a person who's been touched by the grace of God, who owes everything to Christ, what you may say is, I'm strapped, I can't do it, I'm too much in debt, I've got obligations, I'm in trouble, I can't make it, but you would never say, that's unreasonable. Never. You've got a pragmatic way to find out whether you're a legalist or a real Christian today. If 10% is unreasonable to the one who's given you everything, you don't know him yet. If it's reasonable, but you don't know how you're going to get there, that's different. That's different.

See, some of you can get there. Some of you say, I can't afford 10%. The answer is, if you suddenly had a 10% reduction in your income, what would you do?

You'd make due, and you'd be grumpy and unhappy. Make due now. Only instead of the unhappiness of not knowing, feeling you don't have it, make due now, but take that money with the joy of knowing now you're a philanthropist for the first time. You never thought you could afford it. The fact is, you say, if I had a 10% reduction in income, I could make due. It would be painful. You can make due with the joy of knowing suddenly that your radical generosity can change the world and have the impact we've been talking about.

And there's a lot of you who just can't get there because it'll take you time, because you are boxed in, because you're learning about radical generosity. Maybe today for the first time, and you say, boy, it's going to be a while before I can get there because of the obligations I've got. All right, then get in that direction. Move that way. Say, Lord, I want to get there. Give to the place, the point where you get scared, and make a plan, and be gutsy, and move toward that, and it may take you a while, but get there. In Malachi 3, God says, bring the whole tithe into the storehouse.

Prove me. Put me to the test, He says. And I will pour down into your heart blessings that you cannot imagine. That's Malachi 3. He says, bring the full tithe into the storehouse. Put me to the test, whether I do not bring down a blessing into your heart. If you begin to give the way God says, He actually says, put me to the test.

---

最后一点。很多人说——我简单提一下——很多人说："到底你说的是多少？"

我不知道自己算不算激进地慷慨。让我们务实一点。答案就在第13节：与福音相称。

你看，福音是这样的：在旧约中，所有信徒都被要求把收入的十分之一献给神，献给穷人——换句话说，把10%给出去，不是为自己，是为别人。当你来到新约，没有任何地方直接命令十一奉献。于是每个人都开始说"太好了"——直到你意识到，经文所说的是：想想福音。新约中认识基督的人，比旧约中的人更蒙福还是更少蒙福？你对神的亏欠更多还是更少？

唯一无可避免的结论是：圣经给了你一个实际的方式来判断你是否是一个因恩典而得救的罪人。当你看到10%，并且意识到圣经把它视为你应该奉献出去的最低限度——一个最低标准——一个道德主义者或律法主义者会说："这太荒谬了。"

但一个被神的恩典触摸过的人，一个对基督感恩万分的人，你可能会说的是："我现在经济很紧张，我做不到，我负债太多，我有各种义务，我有困难，我无法做到"——但你绝不会说"这不合理"。绝不会。

你今天有了一个实际的方法来判断你是律法主义者还是真正的基督徒。如果对那位把一切都给了你的主来说10%都不合理，你还不认识他。如果你觉得合理，只是不知道怎么达到那个目标，那是另一回事。那是不同的。

你看，你们中间有些人能做到。有些人说："我负担不起10%。"答案是：如果你突然收入减少了10%，你会怎么办？

你会想办法过日子，会抱怨，会不开心。现在就开始这样过吧。只不过，不要因为觉得自己没有而感到不快乐和焦虑，而是拿出那笔钱，带着这样的喜乐：知道你现在是一个慈善家了，这是你人生中第一次。你从没想过自己负担得起。事实是，你说："如果我收入减少了10%，我能想办法过日子，会痛苦一些。"你现在就可以这样做，但带着喜乐——因为你知道你的激进慷慨能够改变世界，能够产生我们一直在谈论的那种影响。

还有很多人就是暂时达不到那个目标，因为你需要时间，因为你受到各种限制，因为你刚刚开始学习激进的慷慨——也许是今天第一次——你说："哇，考虑到我现在的各种义务，要达到那个程度还需要一段时间。"好的，那就朝那个方向努力。朝那个方向迈进。说："主啊，我想要到达那里。"奉献到让你觉得有点害怕的程度，制定一个计划，要有胆量，朝那个目标前进。也许你需要一段时间，但要到达那里。

在玛拉基书第3章，神说：

> "万军之耶和华说：你们要将当纳的十分之一全然送入仓库，使我家有粮，以此试试我，是否为你们敞开天上的窗户，倾福与你们，甚至无处可容。"
> ——玛拉基书 3:10

他说：试试我。把我放到考验中。我将在你心中倾倒你无法想象的祝福。这是玛拉基书第3章。他说，将当纳的十分之一全然送入仓库。试试我，看我是否将祝福倾倒在你心中。如果你开始按照神所说的方式来奉献，他实际上说的是：来考验我吧。

敢于按照我所说的比例来奉献。敢。我应许你，我会将祝福放在你手中。

## 松开你紧握的拳头

Dare to give in the proportions I'm talking about. Dare. And I promise you, I'll put something in your hand.

Now, the blessing, we don't know what that blessing is. Does it mean more money?

Sometimes it does. Blessing means something much more than that. In some of your cases, you won't start to worry. You won't stop worrying about money until you start to give like this.

The first blessing that you'll get from radical generosity is when you start to give in these proportions, and you find that God is supporting you the way it says in this text. You'll stop worrying about money for the first time in your life. Some of you are eaten up with worry, and until you begin to obey this text, you'll never get to the security. God says, I want to put blessings in your hands, but I can't put it into a clenched fist. Your fists are tight, clenched around your possessions, afraid you're going to lose them. Open your hand up.

那个祝福——我们不知道那祝福具体是什么。它意味着更多的钱吗？

有时候确实如此。但祝福的意义远不止于此。对你们中的一些人来说，你不会停止担忧金钱——直到你开始这样给予。

激进慷慨带给你的第一个祝福是：当你开始按照这个比例奉献，并且发现神正如这段经文所说的那样供应你的时候，你将生平第一次不再为金钱忧虑。你们中有些人被忧虑吞噬了，而在你开始遵行这段经文之前，你永远不会获得那份安全感。神说：我想把祝福放在你手中，但我无法把祝福放进一个紧握的拳头里。你的拳头紧紧地攥着你的财物，害怕失去它们。张开你的手。

我无法把我的祝福放进一个紧握的拳头里。放开你的东西，然后等着看我放在你手中的是什么。看看当耶稣张开他的手时发生了什么。

看看当我的儿子放下他的财富时发生了什么。等着看当你终于放手的时候，我倾倒在你心中和你手中的是什么。放手吧。来，改变这个世界。来，改变你的生命。张开你的手。

## 结束祷告

I can't put my blessing into a tight fist. Let go of your things, and wait till you see what I put into your hands. Look what happened when Jesus opened his hand.

Look what happened when my son let go of his wealth. Wait till you see what I put down into your heart and into your hand when you finally let go. Let go. Come, change the world. Come, change your life. Open your hand.

Let's pray. Our Father, our attitude toward money, so important, so critical. We pray, Father, today, not that necessarily people in this room will start to be generous, even to this church. Oh, Lord, if we all begin to obey this text, we will stop worrying about money. We'll start to see all kinds of blessings in our community and in our church everywhere. Everybody will be taken care of. I pray instead that everyone in this room will see that until they begin to stop worrying, begin to start trusting the one who gave them everything to start with, to begin to become radically generous, the world is not a safe place to be.

And they themselves will find that they do not have the blessing that you have promised. Father, I pray that everyone in this room will see that because of what Jesus did, they can afford to be generous in the proportions that you have outlined in your word. Help us to see that blessing will come from that. Help us to understand that. We pray this now in Jesus' name. Amen.

让我们祷告。我们的天父，我们对金钱的态度是如此重要、如此关键。天父，我们今天祷告，不一定是让这个房间里的人开始向这间教会慷慨奉献。主啊，如果我们所有人都开始遵行这段经文，我们将不再为金钱忧虑。我们将开始在我们的社区、在我们的教会、在各处看到各种各样的祝福。每个人都会被照顾到。

我祈求的是，这个房间里的每一个人都能看到：除非他们停止忧虑，开始信靠那位从一开始就把一切赐给他们的主，开始变得激进地慷慨，否则这个世界就不是一个安全的地方。而他们自己也会发现，他们没有得到你所应许的祝福。

天父，我祈求这个房间里的每一个人都能看到：因为耶稣所做的一切，他们负担得起按照你在话语中所定的比例来慷慨奉献。帮助我们看到祝福将从中而来。帮助我们明白这一点。我们奉耶稣的名祷告。阿们。
