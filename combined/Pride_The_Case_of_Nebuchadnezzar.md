## 异梦与警告 / The Dream and Its Warning

And Daniel, the man of God, when he heard the dream, were told he went white, he blanched, he was terrified, and he says, and these are his words in verse 22, you, O King, are that tree? And God is coming to humble you, God is coming to cut you down, God is coming to show you that you are not a master of the universe, but that you are weak and you are loley and you live only by his will. So look it, and you see Daniel speaking at the top of this text that we read, he says, God is coming, he's coming to humble you, and he's concerning, he says, therefore, be pleased to listen to me.

Change, turn, repent, humble yourself, and maybe this won't happen to you. But we're told that 12 months later, something did happen. But what do we learn here?

I'll tell you what we learned before we move on to really talking about the heart of pride. What does this teach us? It teaches us this.

No matter how accomplished you think you are, or will be, no matter how successful you think you are, or will be, contentment and prosperity, the two words that Nebuchadnezzar used, he says, I was content, I was prosperous, I was Lord of all that I surveyed, but I couldn't sleep. No matter how content, no matter how prosperous you think you can get, it's never complete, never. Nebuchadnezzar knew what only a few people in the world know to really know this, to really know this, you've got to get to the top, and very, very few of us ever will.

I was reading, I was watching an A&E biography on Howard Hughes. Biographies, newspapers, personal acquaintance tells us that the people at the top, top, the Nebuchadnezzars of life are deeply troubled people. Why?

Because they come to learn what the rest of us deny, and that is that human soul wants something that is so big, that you can pour all the empires of the world into that whole, into that heart, you can pour all the empires of the world into your soul and it not be satisfied. What then is it that we're really after? See only the Nebuchadnezzars of the world really understand this.

That's why they're despair, because they can't get content, and they can't get prosperous, they can't sleep. There's something wrong, there's something missing. What could it be that you could pour the entire world into?

And the Howard Hugheses and the Nebuchadnezzars and the people like that are deeply troubled, they know what we don't know. The human soul wants something bigger than the world, but what could that be? They didn't know that once, two thousand years ago, there was a little stable that contained something in it bigger than the world.

And at any heart, the simplest, the filthiest, the feeblest, can also have in it something bigger than the world that really satisfies. Therefore, no matter how you see pride cannot bring sleep, success, achievement, a sense of being master of your universe, you aspire to it. Most of us from all of our life trying to get there saying if we could finally get there, but the ones who have gotten there, they can't sleep.

The sleep of pride, okay, secondly, the harder pride. And by the way, another thing we learn from this is that because God's a merciful God and He sees the terrible outcome of pride, which we're going to look at here in a second, He will send you voices, He will send you dreams, and He will send you Daniels if only you recognize them for what they are. What are they?

They're things that are here to tell you you're not in charge. You think you're in charge or you want to be in charge of your life, but you're not. Maybe a Daniel brought you to church today.

I hope you recognize these voices and these Daniels and these dreams for what they are, the merciful messengers of God. Anyway, Nebuchadnezzar doesn't listen. Twelve months later, he gets up and he says, is not this the great Babylon that I have made as my royal residence and I have made it by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty.

That is pride. You want to see what pride is? When he talks about God humbling the proud, he's not talking, there's a kind of pride, there's a kind of thing we call pride that's good.

There's a kind of thing we call pride that's good. And of course, one of my favorite quotes in all of my life that I've ever read is that one that describes it. It's by Esok Denison of all people who said pride is faith in the idea that God had when he made you.

And what she means there, see what the Bible teaches is that you are not an accident. God created you. He created with a dignity and with purpose.

He created you with design. And when a human being comes to understand that and grasp what the Bible says, when you rejoice in it and when you are ravished with that and when you reflect on that, it creates a stability in you. It creates a joy in you.

It creates a kind of confidence in you. That can be called pride, but that's not the kind of pride that Devakita is talking about here. When he says, he is able to humble the proud.

What he's talking about is this, pride, spiritual pride is that which says, looks at life and looks at all the things in life and says, I did it and I'm doing it. I did it. By my mighty power, I'm do it for the glory of my majesty.

Life is by me and for me. Let me break that down. Pride, first of all, is that which looks at the good things in your life and says, that's by me.

I did it. I accomplished it. If things go well in your life, you look at that and you say, ask because I worked harder.

Reason I'm doing better than other people is because I've worked harder than other people. Or I worked smarter than other people or I worked more, or ethically than other people or whatever you say, that's by me. I did it.

Therefore, secondly, pride looks at life and the good things at life and says, therefore, I deserve. Pride looks at life with a very deep sense of owedness. Pride makes us look at life and say, I am owed these good things.

Now, I'll tell you something. Pride has many forms and you've got to be careful. Pride works in a good life or a hard life.

Here's how pride works when your life is going well. You say, I'm getting these good things. I'm doing better than other people because I'm working better than other people.

I'm working smarter than other people or harder. You say, and you say, therefore, I'm owed this. When your life is going badly, when things aren't working out, what do you do?

You look at life and you say, I'm suffering more than other people. Things aren't fair. I'm having a harder life than other people.

Therefore, I'm owed this. It's the same thing. Whether your life's going well or whether your life's going poor, poorly, what it means to be proud is the spiritual pride makes you look at life and say, I deserve more than I'm getting.

Spiritual pride makes you look at life where the things are going well or not and you say, I should be getting more than I have. I'm owed every bit of this and I'm owed more than what I've got. Now the contrast is humility in the Bible and humility is very different.

Pride, let me give you a definition. Pride is that which claims to be the author of what is really a gift. Pride is what makes you look at your life and say, on the author of it, it's a sheer gift.

Pride is a form of cosmic plagiarism. Something else has been brought into your life. Something's been given to you and you say, I wrote it, I composed it, I did it.

You claim to be the author of that, which is a sheer gift. Community is a completely different approach. Humility looks at life like this, it's a gift.

Humility looks at everything. I don't deserve this. If God gave me what I deserve, I'd be lost, but look at this and this and this, all these things.

It's all gravy. It's all a gift. Now somebody says, oh, that's terrible.

You mean you go around a humble person, you're saying a Christian person is humble and you go around thinking you don't deserve anything? Boy, that's terrible. That's low self esteem.

That's awful. You're saying, I don't deserve everything. That would make you hate life.

No, listen, you're failing to make a distinction. Humility is that which receives life as a gift. There's a kind of false humility that says, I don't deserve this, so I don't want it.

I don't deserve this, so I don't want it. I'm too awful. I'm a failure.

I'm a bad person, so I don't want this and this and I don't want friends. I don't want joy. I don't want these things.

那么，我们真正追求的是什么呢？只有那些像尼布甲尼撒一样的人才真正理解这一点。因此他们感到绝望，因为他们无法得到满足、无法成功、无法安眠。有什么地方不对劲，有什么东西缺失了。

你可以说尽天下所有的财富，那又是什么呢？霍华德·休斯、尼布甲尼撒和这样的人内心深处都深受困扰，他们知道我们所不知道的东西。人类的灵魂渴望的比这个世界还要大，但那究竟是什么呢？两千年前，在一个简陋的马槽里，曾经有东西比整个世界都要伟大。

无论你的心灵多么单纯、肮脏或虚弱，也都能拥有比这个世界更大的东西来真正满足你。因此，无论你如何自视甚高，都无法带来安宁、成功、成就或成为宇宙主宰的感觉，你仍然渴望得到这一切。我们中的大多数人一生都在努力追求这些目标，说如果我们能够最终到达那里就好了，但那些已经到达的人却无法安眠。骄傲的睡眠，第二点是更深层次的骄傲。

顺便提一下，我们从这里学到的另一件事是：因为上帝是一位仁慈的上帝，祂看到了骄傲带来的可怕后果，在接下来我们会看到这一点，所以祂会给你带来声音、梦想，甚至像但以理这样的启示，只要你能认出它们的本质是什么。他们就是来告诉你你并不是掌控者。你以为自己在掌控自己的生活，或者想要掌控它，但实际上并非如此。也许今天是但以理带你来到教堂的。

我希望你们能认出这些声音、但以理和这些梦想，它们是上帝仁慈的使者。不过，尼布甲尼撒并没有听进去。一年后，他站起来说：“这不是我建造为我王宫的伟大巴比伦城吗？这是我用我的大力成就的，为彰显我的荣耀。

” 这就是骄傲。你想知道什么是骄傲吗？当他说上帝使骄傲的人卑微时，他并不是在谈论那种骄傲——有一种骄傲是好的。有一种骄傲是好的。

而我一生中最喜欢的一句话就是这句话，它出自埃索克·戴尼森之口：“骄傲是对上帝造你时的想法的信心。” 她在这里的意思是，圣经教导我们，你们不是偶然产生的。上帝创造了你们，并赋予了你们尊严和目的。上帝按照设计创造了你们。

当一个人理解这一点并把握住圣经的教诲，当他为此欢欣鼓舞、沉醉其中并反复思考时，它会在你心中创造一种稳定感，带来快乐，给你一种信心。这种自信可以被称为骄傲，但这里所说的不是德法基塔所指的那种骄傲。他说：“他有能力使骄傲的人卑微。”他谈论的是精神上的骄傲——看待生活和生活中的所有事物时说：我做到了，并且正在做。

我做到了。凭借我的大力，我正在为此成就荣耀。生活是由我创造的，为我而存在。让我来拆解一下这个概念。

首先，骄傲是这样一种心态：它看待你生活中好的一面并说：“那是由我带来的。”我做到了，我完成了它。如果你的生活顺利，你会看到这些好事，并说：“因为我努力了。” 我之所以比别人做得好是因为我更努力。

或者我是更聪明的人，或者工作更多，或者更加道德，无论你用什么理由来说服自己，那都是由我带来的。我做到了。> 傲慢是对自己存在的意义和价值的自信。> ——埃索克·戴尼森 因此，第二点，骄傲看待生活和生活中好的事物，并说：“所以我应该得到。

”骄傲让我们对生活有一种深深的被欠感。骄傲让我们看待生活并说：我理应获得这些好事。现在我要告诉你一件事。骄傲有多种形式，你必须小心。

骄傲在好生活或艰难生活中都会起作用。当你的生活顺利时，骄傲是如何运作的？你会说：“我得到了这些好事。因为我比别人做得更好。

”或者“我比别人更聪明地工作，或者更努力。”你会说：“因此，我理应得到这一切。” 当你的生活不顺利，事情没有进展时，你又会怎样做呢？你会看着生活并说：“我遭受的比我人更多。

这不公平。我的生活比别人更艰难。” 因此，你认为“我理应得到这一切”。无论你的生活是好是坏，骄傲的本质就是灵性的骄傲让你看待生活，并说：我应该得到比我现在拥有的更多的东西。

谦卑在圣经中与骄傲截然不同。让我给你一个定义。骄傲是指声称自己是真正礼物的作者，而实际上是礼物。骄傲使你看待自己的生活并说：“这一切都是恩赐。

” 骄傲是一种宇宙剽窃的形式。有些东西被带进了你的生活，或者一些东西被给予了你，然后你说：“这是我写的，是我创作的，我做到的。”你宣称自己是那个**真正的作者，而这实际上是**一个纯粹的礼物。谦卑则完全不同。

谦卑看待生活的方式是：这一切都是恩赐。谦卑看待一切时都会说：我不配拥有这一切。如果上帝给我我应得的，我会失去一切，但看看这些和那些，所有这些都是额外的恩典。有人可能会说：“哦，那太糟糕了。

” 你绕着一个谦卑的人转，说基督徒是谦卑的，却觉得自己不配拥有任何东西？天哪，这太糟糕了。这是自卑。这真是可怕。

你说自己不配拥有所有的东西，那会让你恨生活。不，听我说，你没有做出区分。谦卑是接受生命作为礼物的态度。有一种虚假的谦卑说：我不配得到这个，所以我不要它。

我不配得到这个，所以我不要它。我太糟糕了，我是失败者。我是坏人，所以我不要这些东西和朋友，不要快乐，不要这些美好的东西。这其实是一种倒退的骄傲，你看，它说的是我要靠自己的努力获得这一切。

我想靠自己去争取，如果我没有赚到就不接受，当然你会很痛苦，当然你说我不配拥有这一切，但深层次里还是那种自以为是的感觉。**真正的谦卑说：我并不配得到生命中好的东西，因为如果上帝给我我应得的，我会失去一切，但是**你看，它们来了。谦卑已经完全消除了骄傲的概念和体系。谦卑说：我根本无法开始去配得上上帝赐予我的健康、智慧、朋友。

我所拥有的，一切都是恩典。你可以说，看看这一切，因此你每天享受的一切都像是惊喜。这就是礼物，好的礼物会让你感到惊讶，比你想象的还要好。你不知道它会来。

它是完全免费的，是不配得的。你应该这样看待一切。无论我们看向哪里，都能看到破碎、战争、残忍和痛苦。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中感受到这一切。

这一切是怎么来的？又该如何改变呢？在他的新书《世界出了什么问题》中，本月即将出版，Tim Keller 提供了一个清晰而充满同情的答案。引用瑞德米纳教会（Redeemer）一系列讲道的内容，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围所见的一切痛苦，并且只有福音能提供持久的自由和医治。

## 骄傲的隐藏形式 / Hidden Forms of Pride

That's just a reverse kind of pride, you see. What that is saying is I should earn it. I want to earn it and I won't take it if I haven't earned it and of course you're miserable and of course you're saying I don't deserve it but deep underneath it is still that sense of odeness.

Real humility says, I don't deserve the good things in my life because if God gave me what I deserved, I'd be lost but look here they come. See humility has completely gotten rid of the whole concept of pride, the whole system of pride. Humility says, I couldn't possibly even begin to merit the good things that God's giving me my health, my mind, my friends.

What I do have, it's all mercy and you say, look at this and therefore everything you enjoy every day is like this urge. Every day is a surprise. That's what a gift is, a good gift you're surprised, it's better than you thought.

You didn't know it was coming. It's absolutely free. It's undeserved.

And you look at everything that way. Everywhere we look we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own mistakes or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus. That's your copy today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Now what's so bad about pride?

Somebody says, what's so bad about pride? I mean, Nebuchadnezzar looked around and said, didn't I earn this and didn't he? Do you know he was really the greatest military genius of his era?

You know he risked his life every time I went into battle. He can beat all those people single handedly. He wasn't an arm short general in just push buttons.

He got in the chair he went out front. He was maybe one of the greatest political leaders in history, didn't he do it? What's so bad about saying that and here's what's so bad in, listen, John wrote, where are you John?

John wrote, he composed that piece. What if I stole it? What if I put my name on it?

If I took it to somebody and said, here, I wrote this and they say, incredible. Not only are you a preacher, you're a wonderful musician. You're an incredible composer, whoever heard of such a multi gifted person.

What have I done? Why would John have the right to be absolutely outraged? Why would you be outraged if you found out about it?

Why would you never come back if you found out about it? Why? Because you would say you've robbed him of his due and you've rested control of his art from him.

Because you see the author owns the work. The author has control over the work and the Bible tells us why we've got pride. Why we don't want to admit that everything in our life is a gift, that nothing we've got we deserve, that we are dependent on God for every breath, because you see if you admit that he's the author, if you admit that you are totally dependent on God, then you have lost control.

And we don't want that. Remember, Dorothy Sayers says, sin is a deep interior dislocation of the soul. It's a desire to keep control of the life and the only way to justify the control of the life that you have.

You have to blind yourself to how dependent you are on him. You say, I don't have control of my life, I'm a religious person, my friends, listen. This is how the human heart works, even if you're religious.

You say, I'll take into consideration, religious tradition, I'll take into consideration, but I am the final one who determines what I do with my body. I am the final one who determines what I do with my tongue, with my mind, with my money, me. I have to decide whether it's practical to obey the Bible.

If you ever, ever think like that, you're still in charge. And the only way to justify that is to say, I'm not utterly dependent. I've earned.

Here's never can listen, friends, you're so self-made. How much of what you are is really under your control. You did not choose your race, you did not choose your gender, you didn't choose the century and you which you were born.

You don't think you had nothing to do with the fact that you were born here and now, instead of in 14th century Europe during the bubonic plague, you don't think that that has a little impact on what you are today. You say, I've worked hard with what, with the mind, with the talents, with the abilities, with the friendships, with the connections that God and God alone gave you. You didn't choose your parents, you didn't choose your sibling, you didn't choose any of your early childhood experiences, all of which we all say are so formative.

You didn't choose your basic abilities and talents and the level of those abilities. God says, what, you want to know what humility is? You want to know what pride is?

Paul says, and for as Corinthians 4, 6 and 7, you will not. You will not take pride in one man over another, for what differentiates you from any other, what do you have that you did not receive as a gift? You will not take pride in one over another, for what makes you different?

What do you have that you didn't receive as a gift? And the Bible says, that's what humility is, a joyous life is that which receives everything as a gift and a self-absorbed and therefore miserable life is that which looks at everything I'm owed this, I'm owed this, I'm owed this. Now, Nebuchadnezzar becomes an animal.

We understand what happened, we understand now that he went insane, it was a physiological thing, it was a brain chemistry thing, we know something about this. He thought he was an animal, he began to live as an animal for seven times, which probably means seven months or maybe seven seasons, which would have been a year and a half or so. But for a period of time, he thought he was an animal.

And we say, oh, this is one of those disasters that comes upon us, you know, mental illness, it's not, it wasn't his fault and it wasn't, but it was a lesson. You know what it teaches us? God is showing us that pride defaces your humanity.

God was saying to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar, listen to me. Because you insisted on trying to become more than what I made you, you will become less than what I made. Because you aspire to be more than a man, you become less than a man.

And this isn't just an arbitrary action on God's part. He's trying to show Nebuchadnezzar what pride does to you anyway. I mean, when a child of mine lies to me, what do we do?

Oh, good parents know that the discipline should be natural consequences. You say, honey, if you grew up to be a liar, you're going to have no friends, you're going to be isolated, you're going to be in jail, your life will be a mess. Therefore, since we cannot trust you, because you lied, you can't go outside for a week, you can't go play with your friends, you can't go out, because we can't trust what you say.

And he says, I've got to save you from the eternal consequences of what's happening to you. Pride where you aspire to be more than a man makes you less than a man. It's turning you into an animal.

I've got to really turn you into an animal to show you what's happening to you. And you say, well, how does pride turn you into an animal? It's fairly simple, but look, listen, number one, how does this work?

Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize with people. And I live with an animal, it's a cat, and you know, cats sometimes look like they're sympathetic. You know, they come and nuzzle you when you're feeling bad, you think, oh, and then you realize she's hungry.

Cats, animals have no imagination, and because they have no imagination, there's no art. And therefore there's no empathy. Animals cannot imagine what other people are going through.

Animals cannot, as the Bible says, weak with those who weep and rejoice with those who rejoice. Can't do it. And pride is a cancer that eats that up in you too.

You see, there's nothing, you're never more human than when you're compassionate. You're never more human than when you're able to sense what somebody else feels. But what is pride?

无论你是被这个世界的状态压垮了，还是对自己的错误或选择感到困扰，抑或是寻找希望与喜悦，这本书《世界有何不妥》都会帮助你看到福音是如何回应这个世界的伤痛以及内心的疼痛。这本新发布的书《世界有何不妥》是我们对本月您礼物的感谢，以帮助“生命中的福音”分享耶稣的好消息。今天您可以在这里获取您的副本：[gospelonlife.com/give](http://gospelonlife.com/give)。现在，请听凯勒博士继续今天的讲道。

那么，骄傲到底有什么不好？有人问：“骄傲有什么不好？” 他想了想说：“我不是赚到这一切了吗？难道不是吗？

” 你知道，拿但业曾经是历史上最伟大的军事天才之一。每次出战他都亲自上阵，从不缺兵少将。他坐上了王位，又走到了前线。他可能是历史上最卓越的政治领袖之一，对吧？

那骄傲到底有什么不好呢？约翰写道：“约翰啊，你写的是什么？” 如果我剽窃了他的作品怎么办？如果我把名字署在上面呢？

如果我把它拿给别人看，并说：“这是我写的。” 他们可能会惊叹不已：“不仅你是传道人，还是一个出色的音乐家。你还是一位卓越的作曲家，谁听说过这样多才多艺的人。” 我会怎么做？

你会为什么感到愤怒？如果你发现这件事会怎么样？你永远不会回来吗？为什么呢？

因为你认为你剥夺了他应得的权利，并从他手中夺走了他的艺术控制权。因为你看，作者拥有作品。作者对作品有掌控权，圣经也告诉我们为什么我们会骄傲，为什么我们不愿意承认生活中的一切都是礼物，没有什么是我们应得的，我们每呼吸一口气都依赖于上帝。因为你一旦承认他是作者，你完全依赖于上帝，你就失去了控制。

而我们不想这样。记得多萝西·塞耶斯说过，罪是一种灵魂深处的错位，是对生命控制权的渴望。唯一证明自己有控制权的方式就是认为自己不是完全依赖的，而是通过努力赚来的。朋友们，请听我说，你不能听从这里的话。

你的生活中有多少是真正由你自己决定的？你看，你没有选择自己的种族、性别，也没有选择出生的时代和地点。你无法想象如果不是在14世纪欧洲鼠疫肆虐的时候出生，而是现在，你会是什么样子。难道你不认为这些都对现在的你有影响吗？

你说，我靠自己的努力工作，用我的智慧、才能、友谊和上帝赐予的联系取得了成功。你没有选择你的父母，也没有选择兄弟姐妹，更没有选择童年经历，而这些都是我们都说对人形成至关重要的一部分。> 你必须蒙蔽自己，承认你是多么依赖他。你说：“我没有控制我的生活，我是有信仰的人。

”朋友们，请听我说，这就是人类心灵的运作方式，即使你是有信仰的人也是如此。> 你说：“我会考虑宗教传统，我也会考虑，但最终决定我如何使用身体、舌头、思想和金钱的是我自己。”你必须决定是否要遵循圣经。如果你曾经这样想过，你仍然在掌控一切。

而证明这一点的方法就是认为自己不是完全依赖的，而是通过努力赚来的。> 朋友们，请听我说，你们是如此自立。有多少你现在的样子是由你自己控制的？你没有选择自己的基本能力和天赋以及这些能力的水平。

神说，你知道什么是谦卑吗？你知道什么是骄傲吗？保罗在哥林多后书4章、6章和7章中说，你们不会因人而夸口，因为有什么是你未曾领受的礼物呢？你们不会因人而夸口，因为有什么使你与众不同呢？

你有什么是未曾领受的礼物吗？圣经说，这就是谦卑。一个充满喜乐的生活是接受一切为恩赐的生活；而一个自私自利、因此痛苦的生活则是看待一切我应得这个，我应得那个。现在，尼布甲尼撒变成了动物。

我们现在明白了发生了什么，他疯了，这是一种生理上的问题，一种脑化学的问题，我们对此有所了解。他认为自己是动物，开始像动物一样生活了七段时间，这可能是七个月或者七个季节，也就是大约一年半左右。但在一段时间里，他以为自己是动物。我们知道，这是降临在我们身上的灾难之一，你知道，精神疾病，并不是他的错，但这是一堂课。

你知道它教会了我们什么吗？神正在向尼布甲尼撒展示骄傲如何毁坏人的本性。神对尼布甲尼撒说：“尼布甲尼撒，听我说。”因为你坚持要成为我所造的你无法达到的人，你会变得比我所造的你还差。

因为你渴望成为人以上，你就变得不如人了。这并不是神随意的行为。他想向尼布甲尼撒展示骄傲对你有何影响。比如，当我孩子对我说谎时，我们会怎么做？

哦，好父母知道管教应该是自然的后果。你说，亲爱的，如果你长大后是个说谎者，你将没有朋友，你会被孤立，你会坐牢，你的生活将会一团糟。因此，因为你撒了谎，我们不能信任你，所以你这周不能出去，不能和朋友们玩，也不能出门，因为我们不能相信你说的话。他说，我必须拯救你免受你所经历的永恒后果。

骄傲让你渴望成为比男人更多的东西，实际上却使你变得不如一个男人。它正在把你变成动物。我必须真的把你变成动物来告诉你发生了什么。你说，那骄傲是怎么把你变成动物的呢？

其实很简单，但看吧，听好了，第一条，这是怎么运作的？骄傲让你像动物一样无法同情他人。我和一只猫住在一起，你知道，有时候猫咪看起来像是在同情你。它们会过来蹭你，当你难过的时候，你觉得很温暖，然后你才发现她只是饿了。

动物没有想象力，因为没有想象力，就没有艺术。因此也就没有同情心。动物不能想象别人正在经历什么。正如圣经所说，动物无法对哭泣的人表示怜悯，也无法在喜乐的人面前欢笑。

骄傲也会侵蚀你的这种能力。你看，当你最有人性的时刻，就是你富有同情心的时候。当你能够感知别人的感受时，你才是最人性的。但什么是骄傲呢？

骄傲是一种自我证明的方式，证明自己在生活中拥有控制权。唯一的方法就是不断地告诉自己，我值得这一切，我应得这一切。正是这种骄傲让你走进一个房间时，我经常看到这种情况。你来到一个新的教会，也许你正要加入一个新的教会。

你环顾四周，心想：这些是我想要与之相处的人吗？这些人会理解我吗？这些就是能同情我的人吗？这些人能让我的自我认知更加完整吗？

这就是在消耗你的尊严。骄傲让你只想着，他们是在为我哭泣吗？还是和我一起欢笑？骄傲会让你如此痛苦，因为你太专注于自己了。

## 骄傲即自我辩护 / Pride as Self-Justification

Pride is a way of justifying to yourself the control you have over your life. The only way to justify that is to be constantly saying, I deserve this, I'm owed this. And it's pride that makes you walk into a room, and I see this happen all the time.

You come to a new church, maybe you're coming to a new church. You look around and you say, are these the kind of people I want to be with? Are these the kind of people that I feel like will understand me?

Are these the kind of people that will sympathize with me? Are these the kind of people that will enhance my sense of who I want to see myself as? That's eating up your humanity.

Pride makes you only think, are they weeping with me? Are they rejoicing with me? Pride makes you so miserable because you're so absorbed in yourself.

That you cannot even notice people weeping over in this corner, and you can't even notice people over in this corner. Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize, and we give you another one. Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego-survival instincts.

There's a great place in C. S. Lewis's book on Pride in which he says, in Mayor Christianity, he's got a great place, a chapter on Pride in which he says this, Pride makes the heart want to keep well away from anything better or stronger or higher than it.

Anything that might make it feel small or that shows it, it doesn't have the right to be the center of the universe it wishes to be. You know what he's saying? It's pride that makes you threatened.

It's pride and only pride that whatever makes you unhappy when you're in a situation where somebody makes you feel less attractive, somebody makes you feel less intelligent, somebody makes you feel less sharp, you get threatened. Only pride can do that. It's that which makes you compare yourself to other people.

Only pride makes you hate situations in which you've got to admit vulnerability, you've got to admit weakness, you've got to admit I need some help. You've got to admit I'm powerless over my problems. We hate it.

We won't admit it. And therefore, like a scared animal, we run from things that threaten us. We run from people that threaten us.

You're ever threatened by somebody. If you ever, S. Y.

C. S. Lewis at one point says, you know why?

You know who hates bragging people the most? You have to be very proud to hate proud people. You have to be very proud because people who hog the center stage, the reason they hate you, that you hate them so much is because you feel like I deserve that center stage more than he or she.

Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego survival instincts. Maybe last of all, pride like an animal makes you incapable of joy. You say, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Now you're being unfair. All along, I've been upset about this. I'm kind of an animal lover.

Animals can be happy. Don't tell me animals can't be happy. Haven't you ever heard of cat purr?

And the answer is, well, yeah, a cat can be satisfied, but a cat can't have joy. A cat, an animal can only be happy under the right circumstances. Animals cannot rejoice in their tribulations.

Animals can never rise above their circumstances. Animals never have anything, don't you see? They never have anything that enables them to have joy in spite of what's going on around them.

Pride sucks all joy out of your life. You know why? Here's how it does it.

If things go well, you say, well, of course, it's about time. You don't say, oh, it's about time. This should happen five years ago.

Don't you see what pride does? Everything is owed. I deserve this.

See? And if things go really badly, you're so bitter, you say, this isn't fair. Pride destroys your ability to handle bad times, and it sucks the goodness and joy out of good times.

There's only one way, then, to be healed. And Nebuchadnezzar finds it. You know how it is?

How it happens? The only way for it to be healed is God has to do it. There's a great story in CS Lewis's Narnia tales about Eustace.

He's a proud little boy. And in this particular fairy tale, he falls asleep with greedy thoughts on the hoard of a dragon. And he wakes up and he's been turned into a dragon.

And you know, he tries to get rid of his dragon skin by pulling it off, but he finds that he's still a dragon underneath. And he finally has to go to the Christ figure to Aslan and say, and here's the Aslan say, I'll have to address you. And he has to let Aslan do it.

And of course, Aslan the lion. Aslan takes his paws and he rips. And Eustace says, I thought it was going to kill me.

I thought it would go right to my heart. What Lewis is trying to show us is most of us realize that so much of our problem comes from pride. We all sent, why is it that you toss and turn at night because you've been snubbed?

Well, don't you hate the self-concentration? Don't you hate the, don't you hate always thinking about yourself? Don't you hate the absorption?

It's misery. And so you try to change it with an act of the will. I'm not going to think so much about myself.

You can't do it. You have to let him undress you. And the only thing that will undress you and that will heal your pride is you have to see two things together.

You have to see that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment. You have to see that your cosmic plagiarism. You have to see that you're taking your life and assuming you're the author one, actually, you owe everything to him.

It's terrible sin. And that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment. And yet, at the same time, you've got to see that you are the object of the greatest mercy of God.

At together, you have to see them both. If you don't see them both. If you only see one and not the other, you won't be healed.

But if you see them both, and that's what happens to Nebuchadnezzar. You notice, first of all, Nebuchadnezzar says, look, he confesses all the peoples are nothing. All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing.

He's talking about himself. He gets up and he says, I've learned when bad things happened to you, when the stroke comes in, it almost seems to go to your heart. You can either receive it in pride and say, I don't deserve this difficulty or else you can do what Nebuchadnezzar did.

And that is, Nebuchadnezzar realized, I deserve this. This shows me my fragility. This shows me who I am.

And he lets the stroke humble him instead of harden him. That's the first thing. Then the second thing, he recognizes that all the things that before he thought were his by right, they've come back to him and he sees them all as a gift.

以至于你甚至注意不到角落里的人在哭泣，也注意不到另一边的人。骄傲让你变得像一头无法共情的动物，我们却还要给你增加一个。骄傲让你像一头被自我生存本能驱使的动物。C. S. Lewis 在《傲慢》一书中有一段精彩的描述，在《基督教名言集》中有一个章节专门讨论傲慢，他说：“傲慢让心远离任何比它更好、更强或更高的东西。

”傲慢让你觉得任何可能让你感到渺小的事物都不应该存在，任何能显示出你不是宇宙中心的东西都不该存在。你知道他在说什么吗？就是骄傲让你感到威胁。只有骄傲会让你在别人让你觉得自己不够吸引人、不够聪明、不够敏锐时感到威胁。

只有骄傲能做到这一点。正是这种心态让你拿自己和他人比较。只有骄傲会让你讨厌那些需要承认弱点、需要求助的情况，你需要承认自己的无力感，承认你无法独自解决你的问题。我们讨厌它，我们不愿承认它。

因此，像一只受惊的动物一样，我们会逃避任何威胁我们的事物，会逃避任何可能威胁到我们的人。你总是在害怕某个人。你知道为什么 C. S. Lewis 曾经说过这一点吗？最恨夸耀自己的人是谁？

要非常骄傲才能讨厌骄傲的人。因为那些占据舞台中心的人之所以如此厌恶你，正是因为他们觉得他们比你更配得上那个中心位置。傲慢让你像被自我生存本能驱使的动物一样。也许最后，傲慢就像动物一样让你无法体验快乐。

你可能会说：“等等，等等。” 你现在有点不公平了。一直以来，我都在为此感到不满。其实我还是挺喜欢动物的。

动物可以快乐。别告诉我动物不能快乐。你没听说过猫打呼噜吗？答案是，嗯，当然，猫可以满足，但猫不能体验真正的快乐。

猫，或者说动物只能在合适的环境下感到快乐。它们无法在困境中找到欢乐。动物永远无法超越自己的处境。它们永远没有能够让他们在逆境中找到快乐的东西，不是吗？

他们从没有过任何能让他们在周围环境不利的情况下依然感到快乐的东西。傲慢会剥夺你生命中的所有快乐。你知道为什么吗？它就是这样做的。

当事情进展顺利时，你会说：“当然，这迟早会发生。”而不是说：“哦，终于发生了。” 你看，这就是傲慢的作用：一切都理所应当。我应该得到这个。

而如果事情变得非常糟糕，你会如此怨恨地说：“这不公平。”傲慢会摧毁你应对困难的能力，并且会剥夺你在好时光中的快乐和幸福。那么唯一的治愈之道是什么呢？但以理找到了答案。

你知道是怎么回事吗？它是如何发生的呢？唯一能够治愈的方法是上帝必须来做这件事。C·S·刘易斯在他的《纳尼亚传奇》中有一个关于尤斯蒂斯的故事。

尤斯蒂斯是个骄傲的小男孩。在这个特定的童话故事里，他带着贪婪的想法睡在了一条龙的财宝上。醒来后，他发现自己变成了一条龙。你知道，他试图通过拉扯来摆脱龙皮，但发现自己的本质还是龙。

最后，他不得不去找纳尼亚的基督形象狮子阿斯兰，并说：“我必须让你来处理。”于是阿斯兰用爪子撕开了他的皮肤。尤斯蒂斯说：“我以为它会要了我的命。” 我以为它会直接伤到我的心。

刘易斯试图向我们展示的是，大多数人都意识到自己的很多问题都源于傲慢。为什么我们在被冷落时会在夜里辗转反侧呢？好吧，你不讨厌自我专注吗？你不讨厌总是想着自己吗？

你不讨厌这种沉迷吗？这真是痛苦。于是你试图通过意志的力量来改变它。“我不会再那么想我自己了。

” 可你做不到。你必须让他脱掉你的衣服。唯一能让你脱去自负并治愈骄傲的是，你必须同时看到两件事。你要看到，你从上帝那里不配得到任何恩典，只配受审判。

你要看到，你是在抄袭整个宇宙。你要看到，你的生命其实是由他赋予的，你欠他的。这是极大的罪恶。而你从上帝那里不配得到任何恩典，只配受审判。

然而同时，你也必须看到你是上帝最大的怜悯的对象。这两件事你必须一起看到。如果你看不到这两件事，如果你只看到了其中一件而忽略了另一件，你就不会被治愈。但如果你能看到这两件事，就像尼布甲尼撒所做的那样。

首先，尼布甲尼撒说：“看哪，所有的人都是虚无的。”他在谈论自己。他站起来说：“当坏事发生时，打击似乎要击中你的心脏。你可以带着骄傲的心态说：我不配受这样的苦难；或者像尼布甲尼撒一样。

” 尼布甲尼撒意识到，这是在提醒我自己的脆弱性，让我看清我是谁。于是他让打击使自己谦卑而不是变得刚硬。这是第一步。第二步，他认识到之前他认为是自己应得的一切现在都回来了，他把它们都看作礼物。

你看他的态度，一切都被恢复了。我的顾问仍然想在我经历了这一切之后与我交谈。现在他看到一切都是礼物，因为上帝只是将树砍到树墩，却没有连根拔起。他对尼布甲尼撒施了怜悯。

上帝怎么能对尼布甲尼撒施怜悯呢？如何能饶恕尼布甲尼撒王所做的一切呢？他怎么能做到呢？尼布甲尼撒王不知道，但你知道。

你知道为什么吗？因为尼布甲尼撒王以为自己是宇宙的主宰，但实际上他并不是。而耶稣基督是唯一站在地球上的、真正拥有宇宙主权的人，并且他选择放手一切。你知道为什么吗？

以赛亚书52章预言了伟大的仆人——弥赛亚的到来，说：“我的仆人必智慧施行审判。”“他必被高举上升，使许多国民惊奇；他们都要事奉他，仰望他所升高的根基。”“他的面貌比别人憔悴，外貌比世人枯槁。这样，他必洗净许多民族的罪孽，王要向他闭口。

## 谦卑中的恢复 / Restoration Through Humility

You see his attitude, they were restored. My counselor still wanted to speak to me after all of that. See, now he sees everything as a gift because God only cut down the tree to the stump.

He didn't uproot the stump. He showed mercy on Nebuchadnezzar. How could he show mercy on Nebuchadnezzar?

How could he forgive Nebuchadnezzar for all that? How could he do it? Well, Nebuchadnezzar didn't know, but you and I know.

And you know why? Nebuchadnezzar was not master of the universe, but he took it as if he was. Jesus Christ was the only one who ever stood on the face of the earth who was the master of the universe and he let it all go.

You know why? Isaiah 52 is a prophecy about the great coming servant, the Messiah, and it says, my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted, but they will be terrified at him.

His appearance was disfigured beyond human likeness so that he shall sprinkle clean many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him. Jesus Christ came and was so beaten and gourd and he was so slashed and gashed and so pierced that people who looked upon him were terrified because he didn't look human. You know why he did that?

The sprinkler was clean to take our sins. You know why he did that? Because in our pride, we try to be more than mere humans and we act like God.

Therefore, Jesus Christ had to become less than he was. He had to become even beyond, he was more beyond human likeness so that we could become all that he was. God made him sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous of God and him.

If you're healed of this pride, Daniel tells you what you're going to be like. First of all, you're going to look up to heaven like Nebuchadnezzar and you're going to say, you are right in everything you do. You know why that terribly interesting and seductive book sold so much why bad things happen to good people?

You know why people have so much trouble with the suffering of this world? There's an assumption. And I want you to prove it to me.

The assumption is the world is worse than we deserve. Oh, really, prove that to me. That's the reason why people look at life and have so much trouble with it.

When you're a Christian, you realize the world is much better than we deserve. And therefore, though you leap over pain, you leap over troubles, you leap over tragedies, but you look to heaven. And this is an asset test of whether you've been healed or you're prior to the gospel.

You look to heaven and you say, everything you do is right. Your ability to handle suffering will depend on whether you believe this world is worse than we deserve or whether you think it's better we deserve and that will completely depend on what you believe about the gospel. But secondly, Daniel says, remember when he says that to Nebuchadnezzar, please turn away and humble yourself so that these bad things don't come upon you.

You know what he says? You see what he tells me to do? He says, remember the oppressed, remember the poor.

Here's what he means. The asset test to know, whether you've been humbled in your pride, is what you do with your money. You know, you may say, oh, yes, I believe everything is from God.

It's all a gift, but here's the asset test. Are you generous with your money? Or do you act as if it's all yours?

You earned it. Imagine people over the years have told me the idea, the biblical idea of tithing, of giving away 10% to the poor, to the church, the charity is unreasonable. What if you turn to somebody and said, I'm in trouble, I need alone.

And that person says, how much? You say $10,000. I'll pay it all back.

The person says, I'll tell you what, here's a $10,000. And all I went back is $1,000. The rest is a gift.

What would you say? How unreasonable, unbelievable that you would want $1,000 back on this loan? Incredible.

Who do you think I am? No, you'd say unbelievable grace. But God looks at you and says, give away 10% of your money to the people around you.

And you say it's unreasonable. That proves that in your heart, you still believe you're your own author. That proves that you haven't really seen yourself as a sinner saved by grace, so that everything, everything, everything's a gift.

The irony is that unless you break yourself so that second kind of pride, you'll never see yourself. You'll never get the first kind of pride. Remember the pride that Esok Denison talked about?

Until you see that you are not in charge of your life, that you're not your own author, you will never see that he is your author. And therefore you are a work of art. Are you an accident?

Are you a self-made person? Fine. Then you're free.

You can live life the way you want. But you're just an accident. Do you believe what God says?

That I created you? I am your author. Well, in that case you're not in control of your life.

But now you're a work of art. And you know how artists feel about their art. They love their art.

They labor over their art. They sweat blood over the art. They cherish their art.

They love their art and that's how God looks at you. How will you know? You are ravishingly beautiful to God.

How will you have that kind of poison and that kind of stability that comes from knowing God loves me and values me? How will you know that? Only by losing control and saying, you are the author.

Which way are you going to live? He is able to humble those who are proud. Let's pray.

Father, as we go to your table, we pray that you would give us the look at our sin and the look at your mercy that will heal us of our pride. Many of us right now are experiencing the kind of difficulties that come from being full of self-absorption, comparing ourselves to others, having our feelings hurt. Oh Lord, help us to see all life as a gift.

Help us to see even our troubles as part of your mercy. Help us to see our material possessions as all part of your gift to us. Help us to have the kind of easy joy, generous spirit, incredible confidence that comes from knowing that we don't belong to ourselves, but we are a work of art, the creator of the universe.

Help us to understand that as we pick up the bread and the cup. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

”耶稣基督来的时候，是如此受苦、被鞭打、被割伤、被钉死，以至于看到他的人感到恐惧，因为他看起来不像人。你知道为什么他会这样做吗？因为通过他的受苦，他成了洁净我们罪恶的祭物。你知道为什么他会这样做吗？

因为在我们的骄傲中，我们试图超越普通人类，并且自认为是神。因此，耶稣基督必须放下他原本拥有的主权。他甚至比普通人更不像人，这样我们才能成为他所是的样子。上帝使无罪的他担当了我们的罪，使我们得以成为上帝公义的人。

如果你从骄傲中得着医治，但以理会告诉你你会变成什么样子。首先，你将仰望天上的神，并说：“你在一切所行的事上都是公义的。”你知道为什么这本书如此吸引人并且销量大增？为什么好人会有坏事发生？

你知道为什么人们难以理解这个世界上苦难的问题吗？因为有一个假设。我想让你证明给我看。这个假设是：世界比我们应得的更糟糕。

真的吗？你能证明给我看吗？这就是为什么人们在面对生活时感到困惑的原因。当你成为基督徒，你会明白这个世界比我们应得的好得多。

因此，尽管你跨越痛苦、跨越困境、跨越悲剧，但你仍会仰望天上的神。这是衡量你是否从骄傲中被治愈的试金石，也是福音前的资产测试。您抬头望天，说这一切都是对的。您能否承受苦难，完全取决于您是否相信这个世界比我们应得的更糟，还是认为它比我们应得的好得多，这又将完全取决于您对福音的理解。

但其次，但以理对尼布甲尼撒王说，请您转过身来，谦卑自己，这样这些坏事就不会临到您身上。他怎么说？他叫我做什么？他说：“记念困苦人，记念穷乏人。

” 这就是他的意思。衡量您是否真正谦卑的标准是：您对待金钱的态度如何。也许你会说：“是的，我相信一切都是上帝赐予的。” 但这里有个资产测试。

您会大方地施舍吗？还是像拥有这一切一样行事？您赚来的。有人告诉我一个观点，认为奉献十分之一给穷人、教会或慈善机构是不合理的。

如果某人遇到困难来找你帮忙，你说：“我需要10,000美元。” 对方说：“你需要还给我。” 你回答：“好的，我会还1,000美元，剩下的都是恩赐。” 你会怎么想？

这多不合理，多么难以置信！您会认为这是不讲理。我是谁？不，您会觉得这是极大的恩典。

但上帝却对您说：“把您的钱的十分之一给周围的人。” 您觉得这不合理。这证明了您内心深处仍然相信自己是自己的创造者。这表明您还没有真正把自己看作是一个靠恩典得救的罪人，所以一切都是礼物。

讽刺的是，除非您能克服第二种骄傲，否则您永远无法看清自己。您将永远不会摆脱第一种骄傲。还记得埃索克·邓斯通提到的那种骄傲吗？直到您认识到自己的生活不是由自己掌控的，您不是自己的作者，您才会看到祂才是您的作者。

因此，您是件艺术品。您是一个偶然的存在？还是一个自力更生的人？如果是后者，那么您就是自由的。

你可以按照自己的方式生活。但你只是个偶然的存在。你相信上帝的话吗？我是你的创造者？

你是我的作品。既然如此，你就不能掌控自己的生命。但现在你是一件艺术品。你知道艺术家对他们的艺术是什么感觉吗？

他们热爱自己的艺术。他们倾注心血于艺术之中。他们为艺术流汗甚至流泪。他们珍爱自己的艺术。

他们热爱自己的艺术，这就是上帝看待你的态度。你怎么知道呢？在上帝眼中，你是如此美丽动人。要拥有这种来自知道上帝爱你并看重你的心灵毒药和稳定感吗？

你怎么知道呢？只有放弃控制权，说“你是我的创造者”。你会选择哪种生活方式？祂能够使骄傲的人变得谦卑。

让我们祷告。天父，在我们来到祢的餐桌前，请赐给我们审视罪恶的眼光和看到祢恩典的眼光，治愈我们的骄傲之心。如今许多人都正经历因自我中心而带来的种种困难，比如与他人比较、受到伤害等。主啊，求祢帮助我们看待生命中的每件事都是祢的礼物。

帮助我们认识到即使在困境中也仍是祢的恩赐。帮助我们珍惜祢赐予我们的物质财富。帮助我们拥有那种轻松愉快、慷慨大方和无比自信的心态——知道我们不属于自己，而是上帝的作品，宇宙的创造者。当我们拿起饼和杯时，请让我们以耶稣之名祈求。
