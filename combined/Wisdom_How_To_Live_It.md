## 如何活出智慧？

Welcome to the Gospel Unliked Podcast. Many of the questions we face in life are complex and aren't always answered by simply following rules. Do I speak up now or do I wait?

Should I take that job or say where I am? That's why wisdom is so crucial. But how do we develop it?

Today join us as Tim Keller explores how we apply God's wisdom to the everyday complexities of our lives.

Get understanding. Do not forget my words or turn away from them. Do not forsake wisdom and she will protect you, love her and she will watch over you.

The beginning of wisdom is this. Get wisdom, though it costs you all you have, get understanding, cherish her and she will exalt you, embrace her and she will honor you. She will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.

Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of the evil doers, avoid it, do not travel on it, turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil. They are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.

They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of vows. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter till the full light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness.

They do not know what makes them stumble. My son, pay attention to what I say, turn your ears to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart.

For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. Above or else, guard your heart. For everything you do flows from it.

Keep your mouth from perversity. Keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Put your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.

Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left. Keep your foot from evil.

The word of the Lord. We live in a culture of choice. Now I know that often is an advertisement, it's a slogan, but it's really true.

Most places and most times in history, you didn't choose who you married. It's a fairly recent idea that you decided instead of your parents. But of course, that's just the beginning.

We are free to be who we want to be, live as we want to live. Do the things we want to do because our culture is the most individualistic culture in the history of the world, and therefore our place and our parents and our social location do not determine so much what we can do. We have choices, choices, and what does that mean?

That means that we've never needed wisdom more than we do now because wisdom is the ability to make wise choices. It's not enough just to be good and decent. Here's two careers you could choose.

They're both morally permissible. Neither is sinful. Neither of them is wrong about either of them.

But if you choose unwisely, if you choose the wrong one, one that doesn't fit you, you could lose years of your life, actually, it could be a disaster. We've never needed wisdom more than we do now. What we've been doing for three weeks, and this is the last of the three, we've been looking at the early chapters of the book of Proverbs in the Bible.

We're looking at the themes of the book of Proverbs. We've been looking at what wisdom is. It's competence with regard to the complex realities of life.

We've been looking at how you develop wisdom. Today we're looking at this famous passage where we learn three things that characterize a wise life. If you want to lead a life of wisdom, that life will be characterized by three things.

A glorious fight, a guarded heart, a living word. Let's take a look. First of all, the way of wisdom is the way of our life of wisdom is basically, it could be characterized as a glorious fight.

This is five to nine I'm thinking of. Get wisdom, get understanding. Do not forsake wisdom, though it cost you all you have, get understanding, cherish her, embrace her, and she will give you a garland to grace your head and present you with a glorious crown.

The words all through there are various words that get across diligent exertion and determination of will. The word get that comes up four times is actually the word that means purchase and it means a costly purchase, so it's the language of sacrifice and besides that it says right there in verse seven, it will cost you all you have, get wisdom. Do not forsake in verse six literally means don't let go of be dogged, relentlessness.

So there's sacrifice, there's relentlessness. Notice that there's a language here, it's a metaphor of pursuing a woman to marry. It says don't forsake her, love her, cherish her, embrace her, and she will respond and she will honor you, so that's the language of passion and pursuit.

So all through here, we're talking about determination of will, something that you actually have to fight in order to keep at the very center of your life, but it's a glorious fight because as it says, it ends with a glorious crown, some of the other verses which we won't take the time to look at, tell you about that, gradually, gradually, see verse 18 and 19, the path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter until the full light of day, the way the wicked is deep darkness, they do not know what makes them stumble. The contrast, the reason why wisdom is worth it is because as time goes on, a wise person gets more peace, not restlessness as the verses talk about, more clarity, the understand things that you never understood, not more and more darkness as it were, and things are going wrong, you're stumbling, you don't even know why you're just getting more angry. Oh, my wisdom is like a glorious credit, it's worth the fight, but why is it such a fight?

Why is it such a fight? Why does it take such diligence? Why does it say, get wisdom, they'll cost you all you have, clear it, why does it take such determination of will?

Now, here we can, whether you were here the last two weeks or not, it's just as well that we recap a bit because it's good for us. And that means the answer to that question, why is it so much fight is because first of all, we're naturally fools, we're not blank slates that we need to fill up with foolishness or with wisdom, we come as fools and therefore we're fighting our own nature. And secondly, because the basic things that are being told to, excuse me, excuse me, sir, the blinking of the camera is very, very distracting, forgive me, and I don't mean to embarrass anybody, and I've never done that in my whole life before, but it's been very hard.

So I'm glad you're here, it's just, you know, years ago my wife would say, I would have been a fool and not even said anything, but I'm wiser today, I'm just, I found a way to make it okay, and you're okay and I'm okay, but okay, all right, here's two reasons. We just, if you were here two weeks ago, look, you have a temperament, right, having you taken temperament inventories that Myers-Briggs, some are introverts, some are extroverts, some are intuitive, some are more analytical, some of us like closure, some of us like process. Do you remember we talked about a study that across three dozen, three dozen different cultures, we realized that there's three basic ways that were neurologically wired in order to deal with problems, some of us retreat, instinctively, some of us attack instinctively, some of us stand pat and wait, and if you remember what the psychologist said about all these temperaments is that since we habitually, you know, those of us are introverts, extroverts, rational intuitive closure process, you know, attack, hold back, we instinctively respond to situations, the way we're wired or the way we've been raised or the way our culture has taught us, and only a small fraction of the situations in which we find ourselves, is that natural approach, the right one.

If you attack, when you should be retreating, if you retreat, when you should be attacking, if you stand and wait and see, when you should be acting, you can die. And all of us are wired to instinctively act in a certain way in certain situations, which means we have temperaments, you say, what's wrong with the temperament, everybody's got a temperament, yeah, that's why we're all fools. Because the world doesn't have a temperament, you see, the world doesn't, if the world was perfectly fitted to your temperament, so the introverted approach or the extroverted approach, the speak out or the wait and listen, the come to closure or the, let's let it go into process.

If the world had a temperament and you perfectly fitted, you'd be perfectly wise with none of us, none of us are. And therefore we're all naturally fools, and to become a wise person means that you have to be so in touch with reality that you know how to get out beyond, you have a range of responses that goes beyond your inborn, your culture, your psychology, your neurology, and you know how to go against those and always act in a way that's wise. Very, very difficult.

That's why it's always a fight to be wise. You're always having to fight against the normal way you do things, but as time goes on, if you're becoming wise, you realize, look, I hate doing it that way, I never don't like doing it that way, but this situation calls for it, so I'm going to do it. The other reason why it's a fight is because as we saw when you looked at the book of Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 3, the things that the Bible says are, the things that develop wisdom are processes, and they are disciplines that you have to stay at for years and years and years.

That's the reason why wisdom actually is always a gradual thing. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun shining ever brighter and brighter to the full way today. Remember, one of the things the Bible says is in chapter 3 that is the root of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.

Now you hear that and you say, what is that? What we said, the fear of the Lord means to have a vital, existential relationship with God, not just believing in Him, but a vibrant, vital relationship in which His love and His holiness is real to you, which means a prayer life. And anybody who even just says, I'm going to pray for 30 minutes a day, you know how hard that is.

It's unbelievably hard just to keep your mind on it. We said another thing that brings wisdom is accountability. Is having people, a fool is wise in his own eyes, so the definition of a fool is someone who only cares what he or she thinks.

That's a fool. And wise in my own eyes, my eyes, there's all that matter. I see it.

That's the way it is. Wisdom always is trying to see the thing through other people's eyes. And so the wise person has got a company of counselors and a company of advisors and friends who are, they're all, they're never making, a wise person never makes decisions unilaterally, but always comes and gets a lot of advice and takes it, you have to be accountable.

Do you have anybody, for example, do you have four or five people or somebody who looks at how you spend your money? You say, well that's private, no, okay, that's also foolish. If you get nobody else's perspective, of course you're going to be, you're going to have all kinds of self-justifications.

You might be very unwise in the way you spend your money. You'd be more wise if you were actually spending your money accountable to other people that you trust in community. That's hard.

One last thing, as we've said, I didn't tell the story on this side of the park's hotel tea now, is you've all heard that you become wise by immersing yourself in the word of God. I think most of us say, and when you read the Bible, that takes, it makes you wise. Now, it takes years and years and years.

I mean, after all these years of having to probably, I probably had a teacher preach on the Bible about two or three thousand times in my life. I'm sometimes, I don't mean to discourage it, it's just starting to feel like I'm starting to get it. In other words, passages that didn't use to make sense, start to make sense because you've seen enough other passages, but here's the thing, it's not just the details of the Bible.

It's not just all, you know, I found a verse that says this, I didn't know I was supposed to do that. That doesn't happen that often anymore to me, but here's what you do have to constantly do. Alistair McIntyre, Catholic Theologian, a Catholic philosopher, tells a story in his book After Virtue, it gives an illustration, it's a lot of fun.

The illustration is, imagine you are standing at a bus stop and a man who you've never met in your life before comes up, never met him, and he says, hey, do you know that the Latin name for the common wild duck is histrionic, is histrionic, is histrionic, and then he walks away. Okay, so how do you make sense of that? It must be some reason, how do you make sense of it?

And McIntyre says the only way to make sense of it is you have to put it into a story. Now it could be a sad story, and you say, maybe he's mentally ill, and that would be a sad story, but that would make sense of it, right? It makes sense of it, yes.

The other possibility is a little more of a funny story, and that is that it's mistaken identity. He was at a library the other day, and he was asking a librarian for a book on wild ducks, he got the book, and he sees you at the bus stop, and you look like the librarian, you know, your hair or your lack of hair or whatever, look, you just, it reminds you, so he thinks you're the librarian. That's a funny story.

That would make sense of it. McIntyre brings up one more possibility. He says, maybe the guy is a secret agent, and he mistakes you for his contact.

And he's giving you the code words. Now that's outlandish, but it's possible. And what he says is, unless you understand what happened in the light of a story, you don't know how to respond.

Now this world tells you that, well, this culture will tell you this, there might be a God or might not. Nobody can know, that's what they'll tell you. And there might be an afterlife or not, but nobody can tell you that, either.

So this life is the place where you have to, if you're going to have any happen, you have to have it right now. That's the story of the world. The Bible tells you a different story, that God created the world, and therefore you, and therefore everything you have as a gift.

And he's going to renew the world, and if you believe in him, you're going to live in that world forever and ever, which means this life is like the vestibule to a mansion. Your entire life here is just the tiniest little beginning of it. Which story are you going to believe?

Depending on which story you believe, and depending to the degree to which that you really take that into your heart, it affects everything. How do you spend your money? How much money do you give away?

If you put it in that story, your behavior with your money is going to be utterly different than if you put your money in this story over here, the Bible story. And therefore, it's not just reading the Bible to get the principles and the rules out of it, though there's lots of great principles and rules. You have to read every part of the Bible, you have to read the narratives and the poetry and the history and everything.

And more and more you do that, the more you become conversant with the Bible, the wiser you get, the more it affects everything you do. Even where the Bible doesn't speak is directly to say, here's how much money you have to give away exactly. It doesn't say that.

And yet, it has an immense impact on the way in which you do how you spend your money daily depending on the story. It's a fight to be wise. It takes years and years and years, but it's a glorious fight.

Second thing, a wise life is not just characterized by a glorious fight, but by a guarded heart. What do we mean by a guarded heart? That's the second thing.

Before it considering that the book of Proverbs is all about Proverbs is all about wisdom and getting wisdom, verse 23 is pretty amazing because essentially it's saying, and there's nothing more important than this if you're going to be wise. Above all else, verse 23, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. Now that is not the modern understanding of the heart.

We believe the heart is the seed of the emotions. We think that the thoughts come from the head and the emotions come from the heart. Now we live in a day in time in which the emotions are privileged.

We have lots and lots of science fiction. One of the meta narratives of all the Star Trek movies and television series is that machines have reason. You know, robots and computers have reason, but we only, we have emotions, and that's what makes us human.

What makes us human is not reason, but it's emotion. That's what makes us not a machine, but a human being. It's interesting that Greeks and the Romans saw exactly the opposite.

They said the thing that makes us humans and not animals is that we have reason, but that's another sermon. Another story. But the point is actually, well, it's not totally different.

Another story. Greeks and Romans and modern people have always pitted the emotions versus the reason. Are you looking for ways to grow in your faith this summer?

Or are you hoping to help new believers or kids grasp the heart of the Christian faith? For many of us, the summer months can provide more time to deepen our faith and our understanding of what it means to follow Christ. A great resource to start using this summer is the new city catechism devotional, God's truth for our hearts and minds.

This devotional brings the historic catechisms of the Christian Church to life, offering a question to consider for each week of the year. In the introduction, Tim Keller lays out the case for catechesis, the rich and communal practice of learning and memorizing questions and answers that frame the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Each week includes a scripture passage, a prayer, and a brief meditation that will challenge and inspire you.

The included commentaries are by contemporary pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, and Kevin De Young, as well as historical figures such as Augustine, John Calvin, and Martin Luther. This month, in addition to the new city catechism devotional, we are including a great companion resource, the new city catechism for kids, as our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share the hope of Christ's love with people all over the world. So request your copies today at gospelonlife.com slash give, that's gospelonlife.com slash give.

Now here's Tim Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. You think these things, you feel these things, and we live today in a time in which we say, well, owning your feelings and expressing your feelings and making them work for you and being true to your feelings, that's what means it means to be an authentic well-integrated human being. Two weeks ago, there was an article in the New York Times magazine called, Can emotional intelligence be taught in schools?

And today, we don't have that concept of wisdom that the Bible has in our culture, but we do have the concept of emotional intelligence, which is almost the closest thing we've got. Emotional intelligence, according to that article, is more predictive of success in life than academic achievement. And emotional intelligence, by that, they mean the ability to know your own emotions and then manage them.

So it's all about managing your emotions, reframing them to make sure that they don't run away with you, but owning up to them, and that's considered wisdom. Now, I have to say, if you read the Book of Proverbs, you understand why studies are showing that people who can control their emotions and understand their emotions have better life outcomes than people who can't, because that's part of wisdom in the Book of Proverbs. But it's not the most important part, because believe it or not, when you're dealing with people's emotions and when you think, oh, I've gotten down to their emotions, now they're getting down to their feelings, now I've gotten down to the bedrock of who they are.

According to the Bible, no, you haven't. Because look what it says here, and then look at the verses afterwards. It says, guard your heart for everything flows from it.

You go through the rest of the book of the Bible, and even just the Proverbs. You'll see often it talks about thinking with the heart, or acting with the heart, not just feeling with the heart. This does not say, the heart is the seed of the emotion, the emotions flow from the heart, but the brain has a reason to think what it says.

Everything flows from the heart. And afterwards it actually says, what your mouth says, what your eyes perceive, and what your body does, is all flowing from the heart. Why?

Because the Bible believes that the heart is actually the seed of your most fundamental commitments, your most fundamental hopes and trusts. It is the things, let me say this carefully, I'll try to say twice, just so it sinks in. It is where you hold the beliefs about the things you think you must have in order to receive life joyfully.

Everybody believes there's some things we must have to receive life joyfully. If I have that, then I can be joyful. Then my life has meaning, then I'm secure, then I know I'm worth something.

Everybody has a set of beliefs of things, if I have that, then I can receive life joyfully. And what your heart chooses to believe affects everything else. What the heart chooses, the mind perceives and finds reasonable, the emotions desire and find beautiful.

The will does and finds practical. So what your heart believes, you must have in order to receive life joyfully, what your heart most rests in, trusts in, hopes in, that is what sets your mind, your will and your emotions, what you perceive, what you feel about what you perceive, and what you do about what you perceive. Because from the heart comes everything, now unless you get down to that level, you want to understand yourself.

And I remember some years ago, two men, young men, both engaged and in both cases, their fiancees broke it off. Both cases, the women broke off the engagement. I was passionately involved with both of them, and they didn't know each other.

They were separate couples. And they were both pretty devastated by, of course. And they were both pretty angry, angry feelings of anger toward the women.

One man, however, did forgive, it was hard, hard work, forgave. The woman who broke up with him and moved on and dated other women and eventually found a woman and married her and had a wonderful, wonderful marriage that a man couldn't get past it, not at all, stayed bitter, and it poisoned all the other relationships he ever had. Because he couldn't forgive that woman who had done that to him, he didn't trust women.

In other words, it flowed out. And so he didn't trust women. He assumed they all were this way or that way, and so he was suspicious of him, and therefore he was extremely unwise in the way which he related to them.

And relationship after relationship blew up, and he blames it on women, it was actually him. A little bit like somebody who says, he got drunk on vodka and soda water on Tuesday night, he got drunk on bourbon and soda water Wednesday night, he got drunk on tequila and soda water. Do you do that Thursday night?

And he says, so what is it that got him drunk every night, obviously, the soda water? Why couldn't he get it through it? And you know why?

Oh, he couldn't control his feelings, oh yes, emotional intelligence, you have to reframe things, you have to realize, you have to count to 10, you have to think, well, maybe the woman was this and that, no, no, no, no, no, they were both very beautiful women. In both cases, really, really beautiful women, physically beautiful. And they broke up.

The guy who forgave and moved on and got another woman and got married, she wasn't anywhere near as physically beautiful, but it wasn't so important to him, but it was extraordinarily important to the other guy. Because down deep in his heart, he said, here's how I know I'm really somebody, and that is I got a beautiful wife. A wife that other guys are jealous of, see.

There's a whole lot of reasons why if you make, if you do that, it's would have been a bad marriage anyway, but I'll tell you. The fact of the matter was, he couldn't receive life joyfully unless he had a really, you know, a woman who is just absolutely gorgeous, that everybody would be jealous of. And he just didn't see anything wrong with that, he lost his heart, he didn't guard his heart, he didn't lose his heart to her.

He lost his heart to something that he had actually given it to, a kind of savior, a kind of, this is what's going to make your life okay. If you know anything about the life of Jacob in the book of Genesis, it's kind of what he did with Rachel. If somebody, if a woman like that was willing to marry me, boy, then that would heal all the rest of my nasty life.

See, unless you're willing to get down to your beliefs, your commitments, your hopes, your trust, you're not going to have any ability to handle your emotions, so guard your heart. That leaves us to the last issue, how do you do that? See, it's not, it's not now a matter of what are in the world are you, what does guard your heart mean?

See, when you first read that, you probably think, be careful about your emotions. Oh, it's a lot more, it's not more difficult than that. There are ways to manage your emotions, you can just stuff your emotions, you can learn breathing techniques, you can, you know, you could read the New York Times article, there's talk about reframing.

You know, it was a little boy named Anthony, he's nine years old, and he did something in school, and all the kids laughed at him, and he was furious, and he started fighting, so they brought him into a emotional intelligence session. It's in the article, and they sat down, they tried to help him to both control his anger, when he starts to get angry, he tells himself things, and reframe it. What does it mean, reframe?

Is it, well, the teacher said, are you sure that the kids were laughing at you because they thought you were stupid and mean, are you sure they just weren't nervous? And they didn't know what to say, so they were just being awkward. So he thought about it, and he said, well, I think you're probably right about some of them, but some of them really, you know, meant, you know, some of them were just laughing at me, but you see, the teacher couldn't go down any deeper and say, well, okay, so now, let's talk about, you know, what in the world are you, so what, if the kids laughed at you, you see, the teacher had to try to make them say, the children weren't really being mean to you, they were just being awkward, but he kept insisting, no, they were being mean, and then the teacher didn't know where to go.

Now you have, listen, there is something a lot deeper according to the Bible than just controlling your emotions, it's guarding your heart, how are you going to do that? Well, the answer is actually right here in verse 20, 21 and 22, it tells you the teacher of the Torah. Now the person who is addressing the young man or young man is reading the book of Proverbs, all through the book of Proverbs, keeps talking about, I'm going to give you my words, and you need to guard my words, and you need to take my words.

What are those words? Are the words of the teacher of the Torah, which is the law of God? It's the scripture.

And the book of Proverbs, in fact, all the wisdom literature is basically taking the law of God, the great principles of the law of God, and bringing them down to earth into daily life, applying the law of God, the great principles and precepts of the law of God into daily life. And so what he says is this, listen carefully, my son, pay attention to what I say, turn your ear to my words, do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart, for they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body. They are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.

Now that's interesting, because you want to guard your heart, he says, take my words. Now these aren't just a person's words, these are the words of the Torah. Take the words of the Bible as it were, that I'm going to teach you, and put them into your heart.

And you see how strong the claim is here? He doesn't just simply say, live by them. He says, the words I give you are life.

You put them in your heart, and that's going to guard your heart now, at one level that makes perfect sense, because how do you come to your beliefs, by the way? How do you decide if a really beautiful woman loves me, then I'll be okay? How did that happen?

How do you decide if this or that happens, then if I have money, if I have wealth, if my career goes well, you know, two people walk side by side in the same career. One person's working himself to death, the other person is knocking off, and why? Because this person over here, down deep in the heart, says, unless I'm incredibly successful and make a lot of money in my career, I cannot receive life joyfully.

How did that person's heart get there? It's got to be through words, experiences, or experiences are just interpreted things that happen to you. In other words, it's got to be through his own thinking about things, or somebody else's thinking, or what other people have said.

And therefore, it's right. You know, when somebody says, sticks and sells me, break my bones, what words can never hurt me. We all know that that's not true.

To a great degree, our self-imagine, what we believe in our heart, is to a great degree, accepted by words that people have said that we can't forget. Sometimes a good counselor can tease them out a little bit and say, so your father said that, and you never forgot that, no, so that's in there. So at one level, yes, if you want to guard your heart, take these words and put them in there.

But does it really make sense that, for example, that man who really needed a major redo of his inner heart and was bitter against women and had such a view of himself, that if he just memorized the scripture, for example, just took biblical principles, even relevant ones, and just memorized them and thought about them that that would do it, no. No, you need a living word. You need a word of life, but let me tell you where you get it.

You have to put the book of Proverbs into the context of the whole Bible, and here's what you see. In John chapter 539, Jesus talks to the scribes and Pharisees, and he says, you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life, okay? You read the words of the Torah because you think that they give you the words of life.

And Jesus goes on for a second and indicates that they are right, but then explains why they testify of me, he says. You're right. The Bible does have the words of life, but you have to understand what the Bible is all about.

It's about me. In Proverbs chapter 8, there's this beautiful poetic chapter in which we see God and wisdom creating the world together. And wisdom is speaking, wisdom is personified.

And wisdom is saying, I was with God as he was creating the world, as he was creating the human race, we did it together, and you read it, and you say beautiful, beautiful, of course, as poetry. And it's a way of saying God created the world in wisdom. Is it, was it only poetry?

Because when you get to chapter 1 of the book of John, it says, in the beginning was the word, listen carefully. And the word was with God, and the word was God. And then it says through him, all things were made without him, nothing was made that has been made.

Wait a minute, here again we have what? The word, alongside of God, but the word is God, making all things with God. Here's what the Bible is claiming.

And here's what Jesus actually claims. Jesus is the wisdom of God, because he is the living word. He's the word that if you grasp and you put in your heart will make you wise.

Now, I want you to think about this, it's actually just struck me this week. What is wisdom? It's not just knowledge, right?

We say it's knowledge applied. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth, brought down to earth, brought down to street level. It's applied.

We know lots of people who are knowledgeable that they're just not smart, or they're smart, but they're not wise. Wisdom is knowledge brought down to earth. Who is Jesus?

He is God expressed. He is God embodied. He is God's wisdom.

He is God literally brought down to earth. He is God brought into human form. Oh, we talk about the glory of God.

We talk about the holiness of God, the love of God, but those are abstractions. And if you just memorize this abstraction, it's not going to change your heart. It's not going to make you wise.

It's not going to pull your heart off the things that you have given your heart to. But hit this will. Jesus Christ is God, the wisdom of God.

He is the wisdom. He is the living word. He is God.

Come down to earth. Look at him. John chapter three, John chapter four, and John chapter three, Nicodemus is a spiritual seeker.

Jesus is very abrupt with him. You must be born again. John four, the Samaritan woman is a spiritual seeker.

He's so patient. John chapter 11, Lazarus is dead. Man is dead.

Two bereaved sisters, Mary and Martha. Martha comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died. Mary comes up and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died.

Same situation, two women saying the same thing. In one case, Jesus gives Martha a lecture. I am the resurrection in the life.

In the other case, he just weeps. Why does he weep here and preach here? Why is he abrupt here?

Why is he patient here? Because Jesus Christ does not have a temperament. Jesus is consummate wisdom.

He's supreme wisdom. And he is God's wisdom. He's all the stuff you read about.

You hear about. But it's all an abstraction. It's wisdom brought down to earth.

It's the holiness of God embodied in a human being. And when you see him, and when you meditate on the glory of who he is, is he's walking through the pages of the New Testament, now you've got something that will change your heart. But particularly, an explanation to say, only if you see what he did for you on the cross.

Why does Paul say that the Greeks and the Romans saw the cross as utter foolishness? I'll tell you why. Because the Greeks and Romans said, if you have a wise Messiah, why would he get killed like that?

Fools get punished because they deserve punishment. Fools, you know, the rod for the back of fools, it's all through the book of Proverbs. Fools are always getting punished because they deserve it.

And because there's too stupid to avoid it. If you're wise, you don't go to the cross. You don't get scourged.

You don't get beaten. You don't get imprisoned. It's foolishness.

No, but see, Jesus Christ is the wisdom of God. He's consummate wisdom. But at the end of his life, he took our place.

He took the place of the fools. He got the scourging that fools deserve. He got the death that we deserve.

And if you see him dying for you, you'll love him. And that's what changes the heart. Look at this.

Love her, wisdom, cherish her, embrace her. It personifies wisdom and says, it's not enough for you just to try to study a bunch of rules. You have to be so passionately in love with wisdom.

Well, here's the way to get passionately in love with wisdom. Love him. Embrace him.

Cherish him. You can do all those things literally if you see him dying on the cross. Because if you see him dying on the cross for you, then as you meditate on the glory of who he is in the page of the New Testament, his character will be burned into your heart.

And you'll get your heart back because there will be nothing, no beautiful woman, no great career, nothing will be as beautiful as him. And you'll get your heart back. He's the living word.

He's the living word. This is the way of wisdom. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see the... We can take this very, very literally. We can guard our heart because we love wisdom.

We embrace wisdom. We pursue wisdom. We cherish wisdom because it's Jesus.

And Father, as we see him walking and acting and behaving and doing things in the Bible in a wise way, but then seeing going to the cross, as we fall in love with him, then his example becomes more than an example. It really becomes a living word brought into our hearts, reframing and reshaping us. Please, O Lord, make us wise the way Jesus is wise.

We pray the name of Him in whom all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hidden. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

请注意，由于箴言4章5至9节和14至27节的经文较长且包含多个段落，这里只翻译了部分内容以保持简洁。完整的经文可以在圣经中查阅。主的话。我们生活在一个充满选择的文化中。

我知道这常常是广告语，但确实如此。在历史上的大多数地方和大多数时候，你并没有选择结婚的对象。直到最近，人们才开始自己决定婚姻大事，而不是由父母来安排。但这只是个开始。

我们可以自由地成为我们想成为的人，过我们想要的生活，做我们想做的事情，因为我们是世界上最具个人主义文化的一部分，因此我们的身份、家庭背景和社会地位并不决定我们可以做什么。我们有选择权，选择权，那么**这意味着什么呢？这意味着我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要智慧，因为智慧就是能够做出明智选择的能力。**仅仅做好人和正直的人是不够的。

这里有两个职业你可以选择。它们都是道德上可以接受的，两者都不是罪恶的，两者都不错。但是如果你做出了不明智的选择，选择了不适合你的那一个，你可能会失去多年的生命，实际上，这可能是一场灾难。我们现在比以往任何时候都更需要智慧。

我们已经连续三周在研究《箴言》这本书的早期章节，这是最后一周了。我们在探讨《箴言》的主题，我们一直在思考什么是智慧。智慧是对生活复杂现实的一种能力。我们还讨论了如何培养智慧。

今天我们将探讨这一著名篇章中所学到的三个特征，一个明智的生活将具备这三个特点。一场荣耀的战斗，一颗警惕的心灵，一句鲜活的话语。让我们来一一看看。首先，智慧之路可以被描述为一场荣耀的战斗。

我想到了五至九节的内容： “得智慧，得聪明；不可舍弃智慧和聪明。你要以她为喜乐，她必在你右边置你为高冠。” 这些话语中充满了勤奋和意志力的表达。其中提到“get”这个词出现了四次，实际上是指购买，意味着一种昂贵的付出，因此这是牺牲的语言。

此外，经文第七节明确指出：“得智慧吧！因为智慧比财物更宝贵。”第六节中的“do not forsake”直译为“不要放弃”，意指坚持不懈。所以这里充满了牺牲和坚持不懈的精神。

注意这里的语言运用了一个追求妻子结婚的隐喻。它说“不要放弃她，要爱她、珍惜她、拥抱她，她会回应你并尊敬你。”这就是激情和追求的语言。整段经文都在谈论意志力的决心，这是你需要不断为之奋斗的东西，但这是一个光荣的战斗，因为正如经文所说，“最后会得到荣耀的冠冕”。

其他一些我们不一一细看的经节也提到这一点。逐渐地、逐渐地，参见第18和19节：“义人的道路好像黎明渐渐明亮，直到正午；恶人的道却像黑暗中的光，他不认识那使他跌倒的。”对比之下，智慧之所以值得追求是因为随着时间的推移，明智的人会获得更多的平静，而不是不安；他们会更清晰地理解一些以前不懂的事情，而不是陷入越来越多的混乱和困惑。为什么智慧如此宝贵？

为什么它需要这样的努力？为什么“得智慧”会说要付出一切代价？为什么需要这样坚定的决心呢？现在，无论你们是否参加了前两周的聚会，我们都可以简单回顾一下，这对我们的帮助很大。

这也就解释了为什么会有这么多争执：首先，我们天生就是愚昧的，并不是一张白纸需要填满智慧或愚蠢，我们本身就是愚昧的，因此我们在与自己的本性作斗争。其次，因为基本的信息传达方式是不同的。对不起，打扰一下，摄像机闪烁真的非常干扰，抱歉，我不是要让任何人尴尬，我以前从未遇到过这种情况，但确实很棘手。很高兴你们今天来了。

几年前，我的妻子曾经说过，如果她那时候在这里，可能根本不会说什么，但现在我更明智了，我发现了一种让自己和大家都能接受的方式，一切都好。好了，现在我们有两个原因。如果你两周前参加了聚会，请注意，每个人都有自己的性格特征，对吧？有没有做过MBTI的性格测试？

一些人是内向型的，一些是外向型的，一些是直觉型的，一些是分析型的，有些人喜欢解决问题，有些人则更注重过程。记得我们曾经讨论过一项研究，在三十多个不同的文化中，人们在面对问题时有三种基本的神经学应对方式：有些人在遇到困难时会本能地退缩，有些会本能地攻击，还有一些人会选择等待。心理学家曾说过，由于我们习惯性地以内向、外向、理性和直觉、解决问题或过程为导向，我们在面对情况时会本能地做出反应——这种反应可能是我们天生的、成长环境赋予我们的或是文化教导的结果。然而，在我们所处的各种情况下，只有极少数时候，这种自然的应对方式才是正确的。

如果你该退却时攻击，或者该攻击时退却，又或者应该行动时选择等待观望，你可能会丧命。我们每个人都有某种本能反应，在特定情况下会采取特定行为方式，这就意味着我们都有自己的性格。你说有什么不对呢？每个人都有性格，没错，正因为如此，我们都成了傻瓜。

因为这个世界没有性格，你看，如果世界完美地适应了你的性格，那么内向或外向、直言不讳或等待倾听、追求结论或让事情自然发展，这些都不再适用。如果世界有性格，并且你完全适应它，那你就会变得无比明智，可惜我们谁都不是。因此我们都天生是傻瓜，成为一个智者意味着你要与现实保持高度契合，拥有超越先天条件、文化背景、心理学和神经学的多种反应方式，知道如何违背这些本能行事，总是以明智的方式行动。这非常困难。

所以成为智者总是一场战斗。你总是在对抗自己惯常的行为方式，但随着时间推移，如果你变得越来越智慧，你会意识到：我讨厌这样做，但我从不不喜欢这样做，但是现在这种情况需要这么做，所以我必须去做。另一个原因也是因为正如你在《箴言》书中看到的那样，圣经中所说的培养智慧的过程和纪律，都需要你持续多年。这就是为什么说智慧总是逐步积累的过程。

正直的道路就像清晨的阳光越来越明亮直到今天结束。记得，《箴言》3章中提到，智慧之根是敬畏耶和华。现在你听到这个，你会说：这是什么意思？我们所说的“敬畏神”，是指与神之间有一种鲜活的生命关系，而不仅仅是相信祂。

这是一种充满活力的关系，在这种关系中，神的爱和圣洁对你来说是真实的，**这意味着要有祷告的生活。**随便哪个人说他每天要花30分钟祷告，你都知道这有多难。光是保持注意力集中就已经非常困难了。我们还说过，带来智慧的是责任感。

一个愚昧的人自以为聪明，所以愚昧的定义就是只关心自己怎么看的人。只有自己的眼睛才是重要的，我看得见。这就是事实。智慧总是试图从别人的角度看待事物。

因此，明智的人会有一群顾问和朋友作为支持，他们从不单独做决定，而是总要征求很多意见并采纳它们。你必须要有责任感。比如说，你有没有四五个或更多人监督你的花钱情况？你说这很私人，没关系，其实这也是愚蠢的。

如果你没有别人的视角，当然你会有很多自我辩解的理由。你可能在花钱方面非常不明智。如果你能向信任的人和社区中的其他人负责任地花这笔钱，那你就会更加明智。这确实很难。

最后一件事，在我们说过的故事中，公园那边的酒店茶室还没有讲到的是：我们都听说过要通过沉浸在神的话语中来变得智慧。我认为大多数人都会说，当你读圣经时，它会让你变得更聪明。现在，这个过程需要很多年的时间。我意思是，这么多年下来，大概我的圣经课听了几千次了吧。

有时我不禁想，可能我真的开始懂了。换句话说，以前一些不太能理解的经文，现在因为见过太多其他相关的经文，渐渐变得清晰起来。但这里有个关键点，这不仅仅是圣经中的细节。这不是说你找到了一句经文说这个，而不知道该做什么。

这种事情对我来说已经不常见了，但是你需要不断做的一件事是：有一个故事来解释这一切。Alistair McIntyre，一位天主教神学家和哲学家，在他的著作《美德之后》中讲述了一个有趣的例子。想象一下，你站在一个公交站，一个你从未见过的人走过来对你说：“你知道吗？普通野鸭的拉丁学名是histrionic，是histrionic，是histrionic。

”然后他就走了。那么你怎么理解这番话呢？McIntyre 认为，唯一的方法就是把这个信息放进一个故事里。这个故事可能是悲伤的故事，比如他可能精神上有问题；或者是一个有趣的故事，比如他是图书馆的工作人员，误以为你就是那个工作人员。

除非你能把这个信息放在一个故事中去理解，否则你就不知道该怎么回应了。现在这个世界会告诉你，也许有神，也许没有神。没有人能知道，这就是他们的说法。至于死后有没有来生，也没有人能告诉你。

所以在这个世界上，如果你想要有所作为，就必须在现在做好。这就是世界的说法。但圣经却告诉我们不同的故事：上帝创造了世界，也创造了你和你所拥有的一切，这些都是礼物。他还将更新这个世界，如果你相信他，你将永远生活在那个世界里。

**这意味着你的生命就像豪宅前厅的一小部分。**你在这里的整个生活只是这一切的开始。你会相信哪个故事呢？取决于你相信哪个故事，以及你内心对此有多深的认同，这会改变一切。

你会怎么花钱？会捐出多少钱？如果你把钱放在圣经的故事中，你的金钱行为将会完全不同，如果把钱放在其他故事里。因此，不仅仅是读圣经来获取原则和规则，虽然有很多很好的原则和规则。

你需要阅读整本圣经，包括叙事、诗歌、历史等。你读得越多，就越熟悉圣经，也就越明智，这会影响你所做的每一件事。即使圣经没有直接告诉你具体要捐多少钱，它对你的日常花钱方式有巨大的影响。智慧的战斗需要多年的时间，但这是光荣的战斗。

第二点，一个明智的生活不仅仅体现在这场光荣的战斗中，还体现在一颗守护的心上。我们所说的“守护的心”是什么意思？这就是我们要说的第二件事。在考虑《箴言》这本书主要是关于智慧和获得智慧之前，第23节非常惊人。

它实际上说的是，如果你要变得聪明，没有什么比这更重要的了：胜过一切，第23节说，你要看守自己的心，因为一切你所行的都出于此。这并不是现代对心脏的理解。我们相信心脏是情感的种子，我们认为思想来自头脑，而情感则来自心脏。现在，在一个重视情感的时代里， 我们有很多科幻作品。

所有《星际迷航》电影和电视剧中的一个元叙事是机器有理性。你知道，机器人和计算机有理性，但我们只有情感，这才是让我们成为人类的东西。让我们成为人类的不是理性，而是情感。这很有趣，古希腊人和罗马人恰恰相反。

他们说，使我们不同于动物的是我们的理性，但这又是一篇不同的讲道。另一个故事。然而，重点其实并不是完全不同的。另一个故事。

古希腊人、罗马人和现代人都一直把情感与理性对立起来。今年夏天你有没有寻找过信仰成长的方法？或者你想帮助新信徒或孩子理解基督教的核心？对我们许多人来说，夏季可以提供更多的机会来加深我们的信仰和对跟随基督意义的理解。

一个很好的资源是今年夏天开始使用的《城市 catechism 日课》，它将基督教历史上的 catechisms 带入生活，为每年的每个星期提供一个问题供你思考。在引言中，提摩西·凯勒阐述了 catechesis 的案例，这是一种丰富的、群体性的学习和记忆问答的方式，这些问答构成了基督教信仰的基础信念。每周包括一段经文、一篇祷告和简短的沉思，这将挑战并激励你。包括的注释来自当代牧师，如约翰·派博、提摩太·凯勒和凯文·德温，以及历史人物，如奥古斯丁、约翰·加尔文和马丁·路德。

本月除了新的城市 catechism  devotionals 外，我们还将提供一个新的配套资源——适合儿童的新的城市 catechism，作为您捐赠礼物的感谢，以帮助福音与生命向全世界的人们分享基督之爱的希望。请访问 gospelonlife.com/give 获取您的副本。现在听提摩太·凯勒继续今天的教导。你们这样想，你们这样感受，并且我们今天生活在一个这样的时代：人们认为拥有自己的情感、表达自己的情感以及让它们为自己工作，忠于自己的情感，这就是成为真正整合的人的意义所在。

两周前，《纽约时报》杂志上有一篇文章叫做《学校里可以教授情绪智力吗？》。而在当今文化中，我们并没有圣经所定义的那种智慧的概念，但我们确实有情绪智力这个概念，这几乎是最接近的东西了。根据那篇文章，情绪智力比学术成就更能预测一个人在生活中的成功。

情绪智力指的是了解自己情感并管理它们的能力。所以这是关于管理你的情感，重新框架它们以确保它们不会失控，但要承认它们，这就是所谓的智慧。我必须说，如果你阅读《箴言书》，你会发现为什么研究显示能够控制和理解自己情感的人比那些不能做到的人有更好的生活结果，因为在《箴言书》中，这确实是智慧的一部分。但这不是最重要的部分，因为无论信不信，当你处理人们的情感时，你认为已经触及了他们的感情，现在他们触及了自己的感受，你实际上已经触及到了他们最本质的自我。

根据圣经，不是的。因为你看这里说了什么，然后看后面的经文。它说：“要护卫你的心，因为一切的泉源都从心发出。” 你继续读整本圣经，甚至只是箴言，你会发现经常提到用心思考或用心灵行动，而不仅仅是用心灵感受。

这并不是说心脏是情感的种子，情感从心脏流出，而是大脑有理由去思考它所说的。一切皆从心中流出。之后还说：“你口中的言语、你目中的观看、你身体所做的，都是从心发出的。”为什么呢？

因为圣经认为，心脏实际上是你的最根本承诺、最根本希望和信任的种子。让我仔细说两遍，好让这个道理深植于心：它是你对必须拥有的事物所持有的信念，这些事物让你能够快乐地生活。每个人都有某些东西，认为拥有它们就能快乐地生活。如果我有那些，那么我就能快乐。

我的生命就有意义了，我感到安全了，我知道自己有价值了。每个人心中都有一套信念体系：如果我有了那些，我就能快乐地生活。你心中的选择会影响一切。你心中的选择，你的思维会认为合理，你的情感会渴望并觉得美好；意志会去做，并觉得可行。

所以，你心中的信念——你必须拥有的事物才能快乐地生活，你心中最信赖、希望的事物——决定了你的思想、意志和情感，你对所见事物的看法，以及你对所见事物的感受和行动。因为一切皆从心脏流出，除非你能到达这个层面，否则你无法真正理解自己。我还记得几年前，有两个年轻人，都订婚了，但两个未婚妻都主动解除了婚约。这两个情况中，女子都是主动解除的。

我非常关心他们俩，但他们互不相识。他们本是两对不同的夫妻。他们都深受打击，非常愤怒，对那些女人怀有愤怒的情绪。然而，其中一位男士却选择了原谅，这是一场艰难的战斗。

他原谅了那个分手并与其他男人交往的女人，并最终找到了另一位女性结婚，拥有了美满幸福的婚姻。而另一位男士则无法释怀，一直保持着怨恨的心态，这种怨恨毒害了他的所有其他关系。因为他无法原谅那个女人对他所做的一切，所以他不相信女性。换句话说，这种情绪蔓延开来，他因此不再信任女性。

他假设她们都是某种特定类型的人，并且总是对他们心存怀疑，所以他在与她们交往时显得非常不明智。一次又一次的关系破裂，而他却把责任推到女性身上，实际上问题出在他自己身上。就像有人每晚都喝醉了一样：周二晚上喝伏特加兑苏打水，周三晚上喝波旁酒兑苏打水，周四晚上又喝龙舌兰酒兑苏打水。难道是苏打水让他每次都喝醉了吗？

为什么他无法理解这一点呢？因为他无法控制自己的情绪，这就是情感智慧的重要性。你需要重新审视事情，意识到问题所在，数到十再思考，也许那位女性是这样或那样的人。不，不，不，不，她们都是非常美丽的女人，在这两种情况下，她们都真的很美丽。

但最终分手了。而那位能够原谅并继续前行、找到另一位并不那么美丽的女性结婚的男人，对他来说却不是那么重要，但对于另一位男士来说，这却是极其重要的事情。因为他内心深处认为：真正证明自己是个成功的人的方式就是娶到了一位美丽的妻子，一个让其他男人嫉妒的妻子。这里有好多原因，如果你那样做的话，那本来就是一段糟糕的婚姻。

但我要告诉你的是，事实是，他不能快乐地接受生命中的美好，除非有一个极其美丽、让所有人都羡慕的女人。而他根本就没有意识到这一点有问题，他的心被她夺走了，没有保护好自己的心。他把心给了一个救世主般的存在，一种他认为能让他的人生变得美好的东西。如果你对《创世纪》中雅各的故事有所了解，你就会明白他对待拉结的态度。

如果有一个女人愿意嫁给他，那会治愈他所有糟糕的生活。你看，除非你能真正地面对你的信仰、承诺、希望和信任，否则你就无法处理好自己的情绪，所以要保护好自己的心。这带我们到了最后一个问题：你怎么做到这一点呢？要知道，这不是关于你对世界的态度的问题，而是“怎样保护好自己的心”的问题。

当你第一次读到这句话时，你可能会觉得是要小心自己的情绪。其实，它远不止于此，并不比这个更难。有管理情绪的方法，你可以压抑自己的情绪，可以学习呼吸技巧，也可以阅读《纽约时报》的文章，谈论重构思维。比如，有个名叫安东尼的小男孩，九岁了，在学校里做了一件事情，孩子们都嘲笑他，他非常生气，开始打架。

于是他们把他带到了一个情绪智能的课程中。文章里提到，他们坐下来帮助他控制愤怒的情绪。当他开始感到愤怒时，他就告诉自己一些事情，进行重构思维。什么是重构思维呢？

是这样吗？嗯，老师说，你确定孩子们嘲笑你是因为他们觉得你愚蠢又刻薄吗？还是他们只是紧张，不知道该说什么，所以显得很尴尬？他想了想，说道：“我想有些孩子可能是对的，但有些孩子确实……你知道，他们在笑我。

”但是老师不能更深入地解释，他说：“好吧，那么现在我们来谈谈，孩子们其实并没有对你恶意，他们只是很尴尬。但他坚持说：‘不，他们是在嘲笑你。’然后老师也不知道该怎么办了。现在，听我说，圣经中比控制情绪更深的是什么？

是保护你的心灵。你怎么能做到这一点呢？答案就在第20、21和22节里，这是教师对摩西律法的教导。现在，正在与年轻人对话的人或是在读《箴言》这本书的人，在整本《箴言》中不断强调：“我要给你我的话，你要保护我的话，并要遵循我的话。

” 这些话是什么？是教师所传授的摩西律法，也就是上帝的话语吗？是圣经。而《箴言》实际上，所有的智慧文学都是将上帝的律法、伟大的原则和预示带入日常生活，将上帝的伟大原则和诫命应用于日常生活中。

所以他这样说：“听仔细了，我的儿子，注意我所说的，倾耳聆听我的话，不要让它们离开你的视线，把它们放在你的心中，因为它们是找到他们的人的生命，也是全身健康的保障。它们是找到他们的人的生命，也是全身健康的保障。” 现在这确实很有趣，因为他要你保护自己的心，他说：“你们要谨慎，听我的话。”这些不是随便一个人的话，而是来自摩西律法的教导。

他让你将我即将教给你的圣经话语存放在心中。你看这里声明有多强烈？他不只是说“照着做”。他直接说，“我给你们的话语就是生命。

” 你把这些话放进心里，这样就能保护你的心。从一个层面来说，这完全合乎逻辑，因为你是怎么形成自己的信念的呢？比如说，你怎么知道一个非常漂亮的女孩如果爱上了我，我就没事了呢？这是怎么回事？

你怎么知道如果这个或那个发生，只要我有钱、有财富、事业成功，就一切都好呢？两个人在同一行业并肩前行。一个人拼命工作，另一个人却轻松自在，为什么？因为这个人内心深处认为，除非我在职业生涯中取得巨大成功并且赚很多钱，否则我就无法快乐地生活。

那么这个人的信念是怎么形成的呢？一定是通过话语、经历，或者经历只是别人对我们发生的事情的解释。换句话说，这一定是因为他自己的思考，或者是别人的思考，或者是其他人说过的话。因此，他说得对。

你知道吗，当有人说“棍棒打不破骨肉情深”，言语永远无法伤害我们。我们都明白这不是真的。很大程度上，我们内心的自我形象、我们的信念，是通过别人对我们说的话形成的，这些话是我们难以忘怀的。有时候一个好的咨询师可以揭示这一点，说：“你的父亲曾经说过这样的话，你一直记在心里。

”所以从一个层面来说，如果你想要保护自己的心，把这些话语放进心中，这是正确的。但是，真的能说，比如那个内心深处需要重大改造的人，他对女性充满怨恨并且自视甚高，如果他只是背诵圣经，例如只记忆一些圣经原则，即使是很相关的原则，这样就能解决问题吗？不，并不是这样的。你需要一个活的道，你需要生命的言语，但让我告诉你从哪里得到它。

你必须把箴言放在整本圣经的背景下来看待，你会发现这里有什么。在约翰福音539章中，耶稣对文士和法利赛人说：“你们勤勉地研读经卷，以为里面藏着永生，不错吧？你们阅读摩西五经，以为它们能给你们生命的话语。” 接着，耶稣又说了一点，并解释了为什么这些经卷指着他。

他说：“你们是对的，圣经确实有生命的言语，但你们必须明白圣经的意思。” 圣经是关于我的。在箴言8章中，有一段美丽的诗篇，在其中我们看到神和智慧一起创造世界。智慧被拟人化了。

智慧说：“我在神创造世界的时候就与他同在，我参与了人类的创造，我们一起创造了这一切。你们读到这些时会说：‘真美！’当然，这是诗歌的形式。但这其实是在说神是用智慧创造世界的。

这仅仅是诗歌吗？因为当你读到约翰福音第一章时，它说：“起初有道。”注意听。“道与神同在，道就是神。

又说：‘万物是借着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是借着他造的。” 等等，这里我们再次看到什么？“道”和神在一起，但“道”本身就是神，在神中创造一切。圣经在这里宣称了什么？

耶稣也这样宣称自己：“我是神的智慧，因为我就是那活生生的话语。”他是你抓住并放入心中就能使你变得聪明的话语。现在，请你们思考一下，这其实是最近才让我醒悟到的。什么是智慧？

它不仅仅是知识，对吧？我们说这是知识的应用。智慧就是把知识带到地上，带到地上，带到街面上去应用。我们知道有很多人很有学问，却不聪明；或者很聪明，却不明智。

智慧就是把知识带到地上来应用。那么耶稣是谁？他是神的彰显，是神的具体体现，是神的智慧。他是神被带到地上来，是神具体化为人。

我们谈论神的荣耀， 谈论神的圣洁和爱，这些都是抽象的概念。如果你只是死记硬背这些抽象概念，是不会改变你的心志的，也不会让你变得明智。它不会让你从已经倾注心力的事物中解脱出来。但耶稣基督就是神，是神的智慧。

他是智慧本身，是活生生的话语，是神。他来到地上，看看他吧。约翰福音第三章、第四章和第三章，尼哥底母是一个灵性寻求者。耶稣对他非常直接：你必须重生。

约翰福音第四章，撒玛利亚妇人也是一个灵性寻求者。但他很耐心。约翰福音第十一章，拉撒路死了。一个人死了。

两个失去亲人的姐妹，玛丽亚和马大。马大上来对耶稣说：“主啊，如果你早在这里，我弟弟就不会死了。” 玛丽亚也上来说：“主啊，如果你早在这里，我弟弟就不会死了。” 同样的情况，两位女性说了同样的话。

在一种情况下，耶稣给马大讲了一通道理：我是复活和生命。而在另一种情况下，他只是流下了眼泪。为什么这里他会流泪、讲道？为什么他在一种情况下很直接，在另一种情况下却很耐心？

因为耶稣基督没有脾气。耶稣是至高的智慧， 是最完美的智慧。他是神的智慧，包含了你所读到的一切。你听说过这些，但那都是抽象的概念。

那是把智慧带到地上来应用。那是神的圣洁具体化在一个人身上。当你看到他，当你沉思他的荣耀时——当他走在新约圣经的每一页上——你就会得到能够改变你心志的东西。特别是，一个解释：只有当你看见他在十字架上为你所做的一切时，你才能真正理解这一切的意义。

为什么保罗说希腊人和罗马人认为十字架是愚昧的呢？让我告诉你原因。因为在他们看来，如果有一个明智的弥赛亚，为什么要让他那样受苦？愚蠢的人会受到惩罚，因为他们理应受罚。

圣经《箴言》中到处都提到“棍棒打傻子的背”。愚蠢的人总是要受到惩罚，因为这是他们的罪有应得。而且太愚蠢了，无法避免。如果一个人明智，就不会走向十字架。

不会被鞭打，不会被打伤，不会被监禁。那才是愚昧。不，但请注意，耶稣基督是神的智慧。他是至高无上的智慧。

但在他生命的最后时刻，他为我们代受了苦。他代替了愚蠢的人，承受了他们应得的鞭打，承受了我们应得的死亡。如果你看到他在为你而死，你就会爱他。这才是改变人心的关键。

看看这个。爱她，智慧，珍惜她，拥抱她。这赋予智慧以人格，说的不仅仅是学习一堆规则就够了，而是要如此深情地爱上智慧。那么，如何才能深深地爱上智慧呢？

爱他，拥抱他，珍惜他。如果你看到他在十字架上受死的情景，你就可以做到这些。因为当你在新约圣经的每一页上沉思他的荣耀时，他的品格就会烙印在你的心中。你会找回自己的心，因为没有什么会比他更美丽——没有美丽的女人，没有伟大的事业，一切都不会比他更美。

你会找回自己的心，因为他就是活生生的话语。他是活生生的话语。这就是智慧之道。让我们祷告吧。

我们的父啊，求你帮助我们看到这一点……我们可以非常具体地做到这一点。我们可以保护我们的心，因为我们爱智慧，拥抱智慧，追求智慧，因为那是耶稣。And父啊，当我们看到他在圣经中以明智的方式行走、行动和行事，又看到他走向十字架时，随着我们对他产生爱慕之情，他的榜样就不仅仅是榜样了。它真的成为了一种活生生的话语，进入我们的内心，重新塑造并重塑我们。

求主使我们在智慧上变得像耶稣一样。我们奉祂的名祈祷，在祂里面隐藏着一切知识和智慧的宝藏。阿门。感谢您收听今天的教导。
