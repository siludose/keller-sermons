# Jesus Our King / Jesus Our King

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Christianity isn't just a spiritual practice or set of moral teachings. At its heart, it's the person of Jesus actively pursuing us.

In today's teaching, Tim Keller impacts how Jesus actively seeks us, reveals truth to us, and calls us to Himself. I'm going to read you from Psalm 2, our teaching, this afternoon it's taken from Psalm 2. It's all printed in your bulletin.

It's a shorter Psalm than we have been, seems like looking at recently, we've been looking at very long Psalms, this is only 12 verses, and I'll read it first. Why do the nations conspire and the people's plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his anointed one.

Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. The one enthroned in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them.

Then He rebukes them in His anger and terrifies them in His wrath, saying, I have installed my king on Zion, my holy hill. I will proclaim the decree of the Lord. He said to me, you are my son, today I have become your father, ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.

You will rule them with an iron scepter, you will dash them to pieces like pottery. Therefore, you kings, be wise, be warned you rulers of the earth, serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the sun, less TB angry, and you will be destroyed in your way.

For His wrath can flare up in a moment, blessed are all who take refuge in Him. This is God's word. It's an advent, as we approach Christmas, we ask ourselves, what did Jesus Christ come to do?

And we've been answering this question last week, this week, next week, by looking at some of the Psalms, we've been looking at the Psalms all fall. And I think I mentioned last week that some Psalms have been understood by the Christian Church as Messianic Psalms, they're called Messianic Psalms, because Jesus Himself picked out a few, some Psalms, and He said, you know this Psalm, like we said last week, John chapter 15, He quotes from Psalm 69, and He says, you know, this Psalm talks about David, he talks about the Psalmist, and the immediate environment of the Psalmist, but it's also foreshadowing and talking about me. And these particular Psalms, therefore, can be read on two levels.

They have, in a sense, two horizons, two reference. They've got the reference to the immediate historical context of the person writing the Psalm, but they've also got an ultimate reference to a greater David than David, a greater king than this king, a greater warrior, a greater suffering servant, and so on. Now this particular Psalm is a coronation Psalm.

If you read it carefully, you'll see that it actually consists of several stanzas, and it has to do with the a session of someone to the throne of Israel. And it can be read, obviously, just on that level. You see, someone in David's line, this could either be David, it might have been originally written when David was crowned, but it certainly was also used in other situations when descendants of David were installed as king.

And in the beginning, it talks about the nations of the earth plotting against the king. Well, it's natural that if you became a king in those days, you had a whole lot of hostile neighbors who couldn't wait to test out just what kind of king you really were, what kind of general you really were, which was the same thing. And therefore, the context of the Psalm is God is seen as installing the king in Israel on Zion, which was one of the hills.

Zion was the original hill in Jerusalem on which the original Jebiusite city, the Jebiusite's built a city in Jerusalem before the Israelites built a city. And so Zion was just simply another way of talking about the entire city of Jerusalem. So here in Jerusalem, the king has been installed, but all the foreign hostile kings are conspiring against this king.

So the Psalmist says, be warned. God is with him. God is going to take care of him.

He will give, God will give us aid. And that's how you can read the Psalm at one level. But if you read it carefully, you will see that no earthly king can completely justify the fury of the threats.

And no earthly king can completely justify the glory of the promises, the language you might say of Psalm 2 spills out over its banks. If Psalm 2 is a river, the language comes up over top of it. The things that are said about this king, this anointed one, are far too great to really be confined to any earthly king.

As a matter of fact, in verse 2, where it says, the kings of the earth take their stand against the Lord and his anointed one in Hebrew. You know what the word anointed one is? Mishayak.

The kings of the earth take, they conspire against the Lord and his Messiah. By the way, on just about any subway car you go into now, there's this great big picture of the Lubavitur Rebbe, Rabbi Schnerson saying, what? Mishayak is coming.

Have you been in the subway lately? If you're very, very rich or very poor, you're never in the subway, I suppose. But for the rest of us, there it is.

Mishayak is coming. The anointed one is coming. He says, be ready.

And it's very good advice. Now look, that's what it's talking about. The Lord has put his Messiah and is installed as Messiah.

And therefore we can read this Psalm as talking about that greater David, that greater king. And it actually tells us three things. It tells us, now lay these principles out and we'll just examine them.

The middle section from verse 4 to verse 9 tells us that we have a true king, a king above all the kings, a king behind all the kings. We have a true king, installed by God, my king he says. Then verses 1 to 3 tell us, however, also that human beings hate the king.

We have a true king, but we hate that true king. And verses 10, 11 and 12 are extremely practical. They are a summons to us to see that though we have a king and we hate the king, we need the king.

We'll never find blessedness without the king. We must serve and we must rejoice and we must kiss the king. And so there's the three points.

We have a king, we hate the king, we need the king. Okay. Let's go.

Number one, we have a king. God says, here's all these kings around, but there's a king above the kings. There's a king behind all the kings.

There's my king, the true king that I have installed. One of the things is so incredibly interesting about the literature of the human race is how many ancient legends in all of our cultures kind of go like this. There was a great king who ruled with wisdom and power and justice and compassion all at once.

And therefore, when the king was there, the land experienced a golden age and everyone blossomed. And we all reached our potential, the land blossomed, the arts blossomed, a relationships blossomed, civilization blossomed, but something has taken the king away and everything has deteriorated. Everything has fallen into decay, but we look for the day in which the king will come back.

Do you know how many of our legends are like that, distinguishing? You have the Robinhood legend, where here's Robinhood fighting because the good king has gone and now darkness has descended on the land and he's fighting just to keep the flame alive until the good king can come back. You have the great Arthur stories, the king Arthur, Camelot.

When Arthur was ruling, there was Camelot, but now he's gone. And supposedly on his tombstone, it says, here lies Arthur, Rex quantum, Rex futurist, meaning the once and future king, not just the once, but the future king. See, that's critical behind all the legends.

There was a great king and when he was here, everything was great and he's gone, when will he come back? When you even have one of the most successful and powerful modern legends, a legend written in the 20th century is Lord of the Rings, all the legends in that cycle written by J. R.

are talking and actually behind all of them, any of you who have read them know that in many, many ways the basic theme is that there's a true king and he's hidden in the north, but he's going to show up. And when he does, everything will blossom, right? The hands of the king are healing hands and thus shall the rightful king be known.

And on and on, it goes. Now why, why all these legends, when the actual record of human kings is absolutely abysmal? The actual record of human kings is nothing but a record of tyranny and of tragedy and of slavery and it's been so that all human practically every single monarchy has been toppled and in its place have been put some kind of democracy.

And as a result, you know, Christians and by the way, with the great one of the great things about the four-clock service as you can ask more questions, afterwards we have a question, answer time afterwards, Christians have been part historically of trying to topple tyrants and kings and put in place democracy. But the question that comes up is in spite of that, why this fascination with kings? Why do the old legends have such powerful impact on us?

And not only that, why do they still have powerful impact on us? Why is it that in the countries that still have some kind of royalty left, some kind of royal line, that the people are obsessed with the royalty? Why is it that in lands like America where there is no king, there is no royal line, we have to create them.

So we take billionaires and we take athletes and we take media stars and we even take criminals and we turn them in to kings. We crown them, they hold court, we adore them. Why is it that there's a significant, significant part of the population that's constantly giving themselves over the sway of dynamic, charismatic figures who abuse them?

Why is there this need for kings? Why is there this need to crown them? Why is there this need to create them?

Why is there this need to adore them? Now I can't get into it too far. That's what I'm saying, afterwards somebody might want to ask me about this.

Christians know the Bible knows that democracy is medicine, not food. We can't live on medicine. It's medicine.

We have to have democracy because human beings are so sinful that none of us really are fit to rule. But we need a king. We are built for a king.

The reason for the old myth, the reason for the new myths, all the superhero myths are new myths about kings. The reason we adore kings and create them is because there's a memory trace in the human race. There's a memory trace in you and me of a great king, an ancient king, one who did rule with such power and wisdom and compassion and justice and glory so that his power and wisdom and compassion and glory were like the sun shining in full strength.

We know that we were built to submit to that king. We were built to give ourselves to that king. We were built to stand before and adore and serve and know that king.

That's what the Bible says. The Bible says there is a king above the kings. There is a king behind the kings.

There is a king beneath all of those legends that even the greatest kings are just dim reflections of the memory trace in us. And the Bible says, if you reject the true king, you will find a king because you have to. Even if you reject the idea that there's a true king intellectually, you can't reject it ontologically.

You can't reject it in your being. You can't reject it psychologically. You will find someone to adore.

You will find saviors. You will find kings. You will adore one of the most poignant things I've read in the last month.

Jeffrey Schmals was a writer for the New York Times and he was suffering with AIDS. And he wrote about it for over at least a year and he just died this fall. And just two, three weeks ago, they published his last column in the New York Times magazine on the Sunday and it was a fascinating column because what he wrote, he said, he was embarrassed to admit it but he admitted it publicly.

He says, before this last presidential election, I'm just so embarrassed, I felt that if I could just get a Democrat into the White House, I'd be saved. He says, I looked at this candidate and I said, this is my White Knight. These are his words.

This will be my savior. He'll get all the resources together. He'll find a cure and he realizes months later what an idiot had been, how naive he'd been, how could he feel that way?

Things really aren't nearly as simple as that. Well, it's just what we're talking about here. The Bible says, you will find a king.

You will find a White Knight. You will find a savior. You've got to.

It's in your blood. It's in a memory trace. King Arthur, Robin Hood, Good King Richard, a Democrat in the White House, or somebody you're sure with someday comes along and sweeps you off your feet romantically and someone who will save you, you need a king.

And if you don't find the real king, you're going to create a false king and it's going to poison your life. My dear friends, your physical nature will be served. If you deny your physical nature food, it will gobble poison eventually.

It'll eat anything. And if you deny your spiritual nature, the king that it needs, it will gobble something. It'll gobble poison, but it will gobble.

God says, I have set my king in Zion. I give my king the whole earth. In the book of Hebrews, Psalm 2 is quoted.

And Hebrews says, you know, to what earthly king or even angel could God truly say, you are my God and Son. To what angel, or what earthly king, or even what angel would God say, all of the ends of the earth are your possession. Hebrews says, is this just courtly hyperbole?

Is this just another one of the kinds of, is this just the flattery you have to heap on an earthly king at his coronation, just the sort of thing that was done? Or is it possible that God has literally and fully said this to somebody? Is it possible that there's a real king above the kings, a real king behind the kings?

And in the New Testament, the gospel message, the message of Christianity is, yes, there is. There is one. Not only one, the Messiah, Messiah gets coming, the Christ, the Lord has anointed one.

That's the first point. There is a king, a true king. But secondly, we're taught here in verses one to three, that the natural heart of every human being hates the true king.

So you have down here in verse one, two, and three, why do the nations conspire and the people's plot in vain? The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers gather together against the Lord as an anointed. Here's what they say.

Let us break their chains, they say, and throw off their fetters. Now that's the translation we've printed out there, the New International Translation. Well, what does it mean?

Probably when you read it the way it's translated, you get the impression that the Lord and the anointed ones have the kings of the earth in chains like captives thrown in prison. That's really probably a poor translation. Now, as I was studying this, I came to realize, for people who know he grew a whole lot better than I do, the problem with that second word should be translated, yoke.

The kings of the earth are not upset because they're prisoners and that they have chains on them. The kings of the earth are upset because they have an owner. A yoke is something you put on the oxen or a harness is something you put on your horse.

And the idea here is, there is someone who owns them. There is someone who demands that they be yoked. There is someone who demands that because they are owned and they have been created, that therefore the creator has rights over them.

And that's what they want to have nothing to do with. They say, I want to be my own. Now, this is teaching us, verse 3, that this is the basic impulse of every human heart.

I think it was George McDonald, he was a Scottish writer who inspired C. S. Lewis.

George McDonald said there's one conviction, the central conviction of hell is, I am my own. Now I think what he means is, that's the one conviction that everybody in hell shares. But also, it's the one conviction that creates hell.

It's the one conviction that will create a hell in your relationships, a hell in your marriage, a hell in the neighborhood, a hell in the community, a hell in your life. If you operate on this principle, I am my own. Get the yoke off.

I belong to no one but myself, you see, I am the captain of my own soul, I am the master of my fate. That, this is George McDonald, is the essence of what every human being feels. You feel it from the beginning, if you're trying to raise any children, you know exactly, that that is something that completely affects and dominates the thoughts and the feelings and the decisions and the worldview of every human being as they grow up.

I am my own. Take off the yoke. And the Bible therefore says that we hate the idea of a king.

We hate the idea of someone who has rights over us. We hate the idea of a king who has a yoke on us who says, you belong to me. You are not your own, you must do as I say.

And that's the reason why the Bible says that human beings don't just disbelieve in God, we hate him. Jonathan Edwards wrote a whole book on this subject, he called him, and the name of it was men, naturally, God's enemies. And it's based on passages like Romans 8, where it says, the natural mind is enmity with God.

You know, there really was a sermon once, it was a sermon in 19th century Britain that ended like this, these were the last words, oh my friends, if virtue incarnate would only appear on earth, we would fall down in worship. That's pretty incredibly stupid, isn't it? Because you know virtue incarnate did appear on earth, and what did we do?

We ran, we choked him, we hid him, we nailed him, we whipped him, we killed him. Why take this yoke off my neck? That we all hate the king.

There's a true king, but we hate him. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good.

In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

Now before I move on, I just I need to respond to the normal kinds of objections that people always give and they raise and they they're understandable objections. People say that's silly that's that's that's that's that's a pretty truly hyperbole.

You know preachers like to over dramatize everything and and so on and sure there's a lot of people who are indifferent to God. There's a lot of people who don't obey God like they should be but the average person is not hostile. The average person doesn't hate God doesn't hate God and and conspire and plot against him.

Oh, really? Let me give you a couple of it. Let me answer the two basic objection one people say most people really believe in God.

Michael Kinzley in the new republic wrote an interesting editorial. He'd been hearing so many people say that America was getting more and more hostile to religion. And so he wrote an interesting article saying he says that's really bull.

He says he says I know that that some places like Washington DC and Manhattan and places like that. There's a lot of people who don't believe in God but an over 95% of all Americans believe in God and he says in this country is it easier to get up in public and say I don't believe in God or is it easier to get up in public and say I do. Now of course it depends on whether you're in Manhattan or Peoria.

I'm sure but his point was he was saying hey it's popular to believe in God. Most people believe in God people aren't hostile toward God people aren't hostile toward religion. This is a very religious country.

He's wrong. Because actually he's defined things wrong. The Bible doesn't say people are hostile toward the concept of God or toward the idea of God.

No, no, no. But the Bible says people hate the biblical God. You see it's the biblical God that thunders from Mount Sinai and says be holy for I am holy.

Have no other gods before me. It's the God who thunders and says I will buy no means clear the guilty or it's the God who sets the biblical God gives us the Messiah and the Messiah shows up and what does the Messiah say? He said you cannot be my disciple unless you hate your mother and father.

You know what that means? He says you must love me so much that any feelings you have toward anyone else will look like hatred by comparison. That's how much you have to love me.

I have to be supreme in your life. I have to be number one in your life. I must have total control of every dimension of your being.

God says that's the God of the Bible who puts a yoke on you and says I own you. I am your creator. You belong to me.

That's the kind of God the Bible says the people hate. And surely there's some people here that are squarming as I talk like that. You know, your back is starting to get up.

You say oh my gosh, what a primitive view I breast my case. That's the normal way a person reacts to the depiction, to the expression, to the revelation of the God of the Bible, not just God in general. You know, if I start talking like that, do you believe in the biblical God?

The God that thunderstorms on I be holy as I am holy, which is I will by no means clear to guilty. What's the average person say? Who does 95% of the people who say they believe in God?

You know what they say? They say, well, I believe in a God of love. I rest my case.

The Bible says we hate the God who is the king. We hate the God who says you are my possession. All the ends of the earth are my possession.

See, verse eight, I own you. Here's the yoke. That's the God that we reject.

And careful, one more mistake you might make. Some people say, oh, okay, so the people who hate the king are skeptics or people who have rejected religion or rejected Christianity, not necessarily. Don't forget this.

Here's a great place in one of Flannery O'Connor's stories where she says there was a deep, black, black, wordless conviction in him that the way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin. I've never gotten over that. Such a great line.

Such an insight. Now, I've used it before, but let me show you how I apply it here. She says, here's a guy who's very religious.

He figures that the way to avoid Jesus is to be as good and as moral as possible. Why? You see, many people use religion to avoid Jesus.

They use religion to avoid the king. Let me put it to you like this. Do you believe you're a pretty decent person?

Do you believe you're better than most? Do you believe you're pretty straight shooter that you've got moral standards and you stick with them? Do you feel like if God showed up now and he was going to decide who he was going to accept into his heaven that you would feel like you'd have as good a chance as anybody?

Or do you believe that you are such a helpless sinner that you have absolutely no hope of ever being received by God except that Jesus died for you, that you have no hope except for the mercy of God which was shown in Jesus Christ? Do you think you're a helpless sinner or do you think? Frankly, you're a fairly moral person to friends.

Don't you see? You're using morality. If it's the former, you're using morality to avoid Jesus.

You keep from having to really be dependent on him, to keep from having to really submit to him. I tell you this, either through morality and religion or through skepticism and licentious living, people hate the king and they express that hatred by trying to avoid the king and they deny and repress their very anger. So here's, we have to move on here, but here's a concluding little point about this.

How do you know if you're a Christian, how do you even know if the Holy Spirit's working in your life like this? Do you know you hate God? Have you seen your hatred?

Have you seen that there's an enmity in your life against God? Have you seen how much you hate the yoke? When you hear Herod in Jesus Christ's superstar saying, get out, you king, get out of my life.

Do you know that that's the words of your own heart? If you know that you hate God, if you know that that's a big part of your heart, that proves you're a Christian because only Christians know that. Only Christians can admit that.

Only the Holy Spirit can allow you to surface that repressed traumatic material. If you don't admit today that you're an enemy of God, you're really an enemy of God. The only way to become his friend is to admit you're his enemy.

The only way to know that God's Holy Spirit's working in your life is if you're able to see that resentment, we have a king, we hate the king, lastly, thirdly, we need the king. Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, look, if you see you have the king, and you also see you hate the king, the only recourse you have is to persuade, is to be persuaded, I'll explain that, to be persuaded that you need the king. Serve the king, kiss the king, rejoice in the king.

But you see, what Verses 10, 11 and 12 says, there's no in between. You can either serve and rejoice and kiss the king, and you'll find a refuge in him and be blessed. Or you won't serve, you won't rejoice, and you won't kiss the king, and you will perish.

You will be destroyed in your way. Where you stand is a tremendous statement. The saying is, there is no refuge from the king.

There's only refuge in the king. See, no in between. There's no refuge from the king, only refuge in the king.

You need the king. You have to be persuaded of that, let me put it to you this way. The principle of Verses 10, 11 and 12 is that the yoke eventually becomes a refuge, that confinement eventually becomes spaciousness, that service eventually becomes freedom, that if you pull the yoke off of your back, because you think it's bondage and slavery, you will find that you will perish.

You need that yoke. In fact, the yoke is the only way to get you into freedom. So, you know, just maybe a perfect illustration, let's just say here's a young lady, and she wants to be a great musician.

So how do you, maybe you or maybe she, maybe if you're her parents or something, you see this great artistic gift in her, and you want that artistic gift to realize, well, what do you do? The yoke, she's yoke to her piano, hours every day. Some days she wants to go, some days she doesn't want, some days she likes to practice, some days she doesn't want to practice, but every day she's yoke to the piano, she's yoke to her practice, and as time goes on, the yoke becomes a refuge.

You see, as time goes on, her artistic skill starts to blossom, as time goes on, she begins to be able to express herself in a way that she never could have otherwise if she hadn't gone through the routine and let's face it, the drudgery of practice. The yoke becomes a refuge. The yoke becomes blessedness, and let me tell you, there's nothing more tragic to have a kid come to you and say, mom, dad, why didn't you make me practice?

Why didn't you make me study? My potential is ruined, my chances have gone by. Why didn't you make me?

And the only thing to say to a kid is this, because you know, ultimately you can't make somebody do that. The yoke always has to be eventually received by you. You have to take it on.

I couldn't, you say, make you practice. I couldn't make you study. I couldn't show you that the yoke was the way to free them.

There's nothing more tragic than that. All right, see how the analogy works? The Bible says that in every human being there are potential, there's potential.

There are things. You will blossom if you come into the king and places you didn't know your head buds. You've got potential that only will come if you come in under the yoke, under the yoke of the king.

To believe and obey and love a king means you can find yourself. It means you no longer in charge of your life. But that's the same.

You're yoke. That's the way it is. That's what it means to come in under a king.

The Bible says, because you need a king, you can't understand yourself psychologically, you can't understand yourself culturally. You can't understand yourself unless you see that you're driven by this need for a king. You're trying to get back to Camelot.

And there's no alternative for you. And therefore unless you submit yourself to what you were built for, you will perish in the way. Do you see that until you submit to the king, the king, until you give yourself to him utterly and completely?

Your heart, the Bible says, is like an eight-cylinder engine running on one cylinder. Have you ever tried that? It spits and it costs and it lurches and it halts and it's terrible, don't you see?

You're two deepest needs. You need to feel that you count, that you're accomplishing something and you need to feel that you're loved, that you're valuable to someone. And when you serve the king and you kiss the king, those two needs, and only then are those two needs satisfied because when you serve him, he serves you and when you kiss him, he kisses you.

That's the way it is in a relationship. And then oh, blessed are they who take refuge in him. Now let me just conclude by giving you a couple of fairly practical examples here.

The Bible gives us right here in verse 10, 11 and 12 of what it really means to submit to the king. Let me just give you three. Actually let me give you four and afterwards I'm going to be real brief about it and if people want me to draw them out, you can draw them out afterwards in the question and answer time.

How do you treat Jesus as a king? A lot of you have believed in Jesus in the general way. A lot of you have even asked Jesus for help in your life but you're not treating him as a king.

And this is the reason why you're not seeing the blessedness in your life. You're not treating him as a king. If you want to treat him as a king, you've got to do four things.

Obey, submit, rely and expect. Obey, submit, rely and expect. Look.

Obey. Maybe that's too easy. Maybe I shouldn't spend much time on it, but wait.

To obey. Some of you think you're obeying and you're not. If you say, okay, here's the rules.

Look at all the things that the king says. Always forgive, always. Always tell the truth, always.

Always return, never return evil for evil, but always return evil for good. Use sex as a commitment, a covenant renewal ceremony for a permanent exclusive marriage contract. Don't envy.

Don't be bitter and so on. Now there they are. Look, nobody in this room, none of us, are going to be perfect at keeping those up.

But there's a difference between someone who is real at Jesus' being king and there's a difference between someone who is making Jesus nothing but a consultant. You see, it's one thing that when I come to somebody, some of you are bitter right now, some of you are mad at people and you won't let go. You're playing the tapes.

You won't forgive. You know you should, but you won't. You're going to perish in the way.

You're trying to throw the yoke off of yourself. Don't you see? His yoke is easy.

His burden is light. If you forgive, if you obey and forgive, it'll heal you because there's a difference. I can sometimes go to people and say, I can see that you're not forgiving.

Yes, they say. What are you going to do about it? A Christian always says, I need help.

I know it's wrong. I refuse. I'm not doing it.

I've got to do it. What do I do? But there's another kind of person that says, yes, I know it's wrong, but this person deserves it.

Don't tell me how to run my life. If you say, I'll obey, if it feels good, I'll obey if it's practical, I'll obey if it's popular, I'll obey if it's pragmatic. You're not obeying at all.

Jesus is not in your life as a king. Jesus is in your life as a consultant. He is giving you recommendations and you're deciding who to sleep with and you're deciding when to forgive and you're deciding what you're going to do and what you're not going to do.

He's only a consultant. He won't come that way. How dare you treat him that way.

Look at who he is. You mustn't obey. Treat him as a king.

You have to obey him. You have to say, not my will, but mine be done. Number two, to treat him as a king, you have to accept.

Submit to the way in which he's ordering your life. This is harder. That's what I'm mentioning it, bro, brief.

Some people are very obedient as to what he actually says, but when God lets things come into your life, that you just think, this isn't right, this isn't fair. Look at how he's letting the circumstances of my life go. You won't treat him as a king then.

You know what it means to treat him as a king? To say, you must know what best. Oh, it doesn't mean that you just put a cheery smile on your face and you say, I'm just praising Jesus.

Everything is just fine. I'm sure he knows what's best in that sense. You have to wrestle and you have to struggle.

But you know, you have to be like Job. There's one great place in Job chapter 23. In one of his better times and all of his wrestling, he says, I don't sense God's presence.

But the things God is allowing to happen, fill me with terror. But quote, he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold. But he knows my way and when he has tested me, I will come forth as pure gold.

You know what he's doing there? He's accepting the kingship of Jesus in his life, he's saying, I don't understand what's going on and it terrifies me and I wrestle, but I know that if I respond obediently, if I accept what he's giving me, if I am faithful in the midst of this great fiery furnace, I will come forth as pure gold. I'll be a humbler.

I'll be more sensitive. I'll be more loving. I'll be more compassionate.

He is submits to the fact that his circumstances are purifying. Do you give Jesus the kingship like that? Okay.

Number one, after obey. Number two, you have to submit, accept the circumstances. Number three, you have to rely on him when he says, kiss the sun.

You know what that means? If you add anything to Jesus as a requirement for being happy, if you add anything to Jesus as a requirement for being happy, that's your real king. You see, if you say, I'll be happy to become a Christian as long as these things go in my life, very often, you come to Christianity because something is going wrong in an area of your life, something that really is important to you, something that's your real king.

And you go to Jesus and you say, I'm going to do this in this for you, but will you please get me that? And if your life doesn't go right in that direction, if those things don't happen to you, you're ready to throw the whole thing over and say, in vain have I kept my hands pure. In vain have I washed my hands and my heart and innocence.

What does it mean to kiss the king? It means to obey him and submit to him because you're ravished with his beauty. It means to say there is nothing I love more than my king.

It means I won't make my king a means to an end, but the king's love is enough in itself. And lastly, obey, submit, rely, one more thing, expect, rejoice with trembling. What does that mean?

I believe that if you are too pessimistic with regards to what Jesus can do in your life, you're not treating him as a king. You have to have the expectations that are worthy of a king. You've got a king coming into your life.

You know there's a place where John Newton says, Valorate coming to a king, large petitions with the bring for his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much. Do you treat him like a king or do you look at the problems in your life and say nothing's ever going to happen there? That's always going to be.

That's the way things are always going to be. Valorate coming to a king, large petitions with the bring for his grace and power are such none can ever ask too much. What do you see if you're pessimistic about what I can do in your life and what I can do through you, you are not treating him as a king.

Can you serve him? Can you obey him? Can you kiss him?

Can you rejoice with trembling? There's no refuge from him, but there's a tremendous refuge in him. Blessed are those who find refuge in the king.

Let's pray. Father, we ask now that as we think about these things, because it's your word, that your spirit would come and open our hearts to how we should be applying these things, I pray that everybody here might find that as they come and they kiss the king and they obey out of love for him, that they'll find that the lives are opening up. They forgive us for wanting to pull the yoke off.

Show us that the yoke becomes a refuge, that confinement becomes spaciousness, that service, your service is our perfect freedom. It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life Podcast.

欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。基督教不仅仅是灵性修炼或道德教诲。它的核心是耶稣基督主动地追求我们。今天，蒂姆·凯勒将向我们展示耶稣如何积极地寻找我们、向我们揭示真理，并呼召我们归向祂。

我将从诗篇2章读一段经文，今天下午的教导就取自诗篇2章。这段经文在你们的讲道单上也有印出。这是一首比最近我们所读的短得多的诗篇，似乎显得比较简短，我们之前一直在阅读很长的诗篇，这首只有12节，我先来念一遍：为什么列国喧哗？万民纷纷骚动？

君王们聚集起来，谋士们也密谋反抗耶和华和他的受膏者。他们说：“我们要挣脱锁链；要扔掉枷锁。”那位坐在天上的人嗤笑他们；主笑他们。他在震怒中斥责他们，在烈怒中惊吓他们，说：我已经立我的君在锡安——我的圣山之上。

我要宣告耶和华的命令：他对我这样说：“你是我的儿子，我今日生你。”求你向我发怜悯！愿你用能力和慈爱护卫我；愿你为我保留预备好的道路，好叫我的脚站在高处，使我的脚稳住。你作王治理万国，耶和华已经将万国赐给你。

现在，你们这些君王要聪明；你们这些审判地上列邦的，要留心听！以敬畏我的，作为你们的律例吧；因我必要求问你们的一切事，并考察你们一切的道路。你们当归向我，你们和你们的君王都要来侍奉我，因为他是从天上耶和华来的君王，是施行拯救的大能者。他必在阵场上把列国击破，将他们治服；他们要像陶泥一样在他面前摔碎，好像火炬将干草烧毁一样。

所以，你们这些君王当作聪明人，你们这些审判地上列邦的君王都要受警告：要敬畏耶和华，惧怕他。因为他的烈怒随时发作，凡投靠他的必得福乐。这是神的话语。随着圣诞节的临近，我们不禁问自己：耶稣基督来是要做什么？

我们上周、本周，甚至下周都在通过一些诗篇来回答这个问题。整个秋季，我们都一直在研究诗篇。我想我上星期提过，有些诗篇被基督教教会理解为是关于弥赛亚的诗篇，这些诗篇被称为“弥赛亚诗篇”，因为耶稣自己也曾引用了几首诗篇，并说：“你们知道这首诗篇讲的是大卫，讲的是诗人和他的环境，但同时也预示着我。”因此，这些特定的诗篇可以在两个层面上阅读。

它们在某种意义上具有两个视角、两个参照系。一方面，它们有关于写诗者当时的历史背景；另一方面，则指向一个比大卫更大的弥赛亚王，一个比这位国王更伟大的君主，一个更伟大的勇士，一个更伟大的受苦仆人等等。现在我们来看这首特定的诗篇，它是一首加冕诗。如果你仔细阅读，你会发现它实际上由几个段落组成，描述了某人在以色列锡安山登基的过程。

当然，你也可以仅仅从这个层面来理解它。你看，这可能是大卫后裔中的一员，这人可以是大卫本人，在大卫被加冕时这首诗可能最初就被写下了，但肯定也被用于其他场合，当大卫的后代被立为国王的时候。在诗篇的开头部分提到，各国都在策划对付这位君王。当然，在那个时代，如果你成为了一位君王，你肯定会有很多敌对的邻国迫不及待地想看看你是怎样的君主，是怎样的将军，这两者是相同的。

因此，这首诗篇的背景是上帝在锡安山立大卫的后裔为以色列的国王。锡安山是耶路撒冷最初的一座山，基述人曾在那里建城。在以色列人建立自己的城市之前，基述人在耶路撒冷建造了一座城市。因此，锡安只是整个耶路撒冷城市的另一种说法。

所以，在耶路撒冷，王已经就位，但所有外来的敌对国王都在密谋反对这位王。诗篇作者说：“当警醒。”神与他同在，神会照顾他。“他会给我们援助”，这就是你可以在一个层面上理解这首诗的方式。

但如果仔细阅读，你会发现任何人间的君王都无法完全解释威胁的愤怒。同样，任何人间的君王也无法完全解释诺言的荣耀。诗篇2章的语言溢出了它的边界。如果将诗篇2比作一条河，语言已经溢出河岸。

关于这位君王、受膏者的言论太过伟大，无法仅限于任何一位人间的君王。事实上，在第2节中提到“地上的君王聚集起来反对耶和华和他的受膏者”（希伯来文）。你知道“受膏者”是什么意思吗？是弥赛亚。

地上的君王聚集起来，密谋反对耶和华和他的弥赛亚。顺便说一句，在现在的地铁车厢里，你几乎都能看到拉巴维奇拉比·施奈森的大幅照片，上面写着什么？他说：“弥赛亚要来了。” 你最近坐过地铁吗？

如果你非常富有或非常贫穷，可能不会经常坐。但对于大多数人来说，那里就有他的照片。弥赛亚要来了，受膏者要来了。他说，“做好准备。

”这是非常好的建议。现在，这就是它在谈论的内容：耶和华已经立了他的弥赛亚为王。因此，我们可以将这首诗理解为关于那位更伟大的大卫、那位更大的君王的预言。实际上，它告诉我们三点。

我们来逐一列出并加以探讨。中间部分从第4节到第9节告诉我们，我们有一位**真正的国王，一位凌驾于所有其他国王之上的国王；一位站在所有其他国王背后的国王。我们有一位由神所立的真实国王，他说：“他是**我的王。”然而，第1节至第3节却告诉我们，人类憎恨这位君王。

我们有一位**真正的王，但我们却憎恨这位真王。第10、11和12节非常实用，是**对我们的召唤：虽然我们有王而憎恨王，但**我们需要王。**没有王就没有福分。我们必须侍奉他，必须喜乐，必须亲吻王。

这就是三点： 我们有王，我们憎恨王，**我们需要王。**好的，让我们开始吧。第一点，我们有王。神说，这里有许多国王，但有一位凌驾于所有国王之上的王。

有一位在所有国王背后的王。我的王，我所立的真王。人类文学中非常有趣的一件事是，在我们的文化中有很多古老的传说都类似这样：有一个伟大的国王，他以智慧、力量、公义和怜悯统治着整个国家。因此，当国王在位时，国家经历了黄金时代，每个人都繁荣起来。

我们都达到了自己的潜力，土地繁荣，艺术繁荣，人际关系繁荣，文明繁荣，但不知为何国王离开了，一切都开始衰退，一切都在腐朽。但我们期盼有一天国王会回来。你知道有多少传说都是这样的吗？比如罗宾汉的传说：这里有一个好国王，但现在黑暗笼罩大地，罗宾汉为了保持希望之光而战斗，直到好国王归来。

还有伟大的亚瑟王传说，卡美洛。当亚瑟王统治时，有卡美洛，但现在他离开了。据说在他的墓碑上写着：“亚瑟，曾经的王者，未来的王者。”你看，这背后至关重要。

有一个伟大的国王，在他统治期间一切都很好，但他离开了，他会什么时候回来？即使是最成功和最强大的现代传说之一《指环王》也是这样的故事，这个20世纪创作的传奇由J.R.R. 托尔金所写。在谈论这些传说时，你们知道，在很多方面，它们的基本主题是：有一个真正的国王，他隐藏在北方，但终将显现。当他出现时，一切都会焕然一新，对吧？

国王的手是治愈之手，因此**真正的国王才会被世人所知。就这样，这些传说一个接一个地流传下来。那么，为什么会有这么多关于国王的传说呢？当人类君主的实际记录如此糟糕时——实际上，人类君主的历史无非是**一连串暴政、悲剧和奴役，几乎每一个王权都已覆灭，取而代之的是某种形式的民主。

因此，你知道，基督徒们历史上一直致力于推翻暴君和国王，建立民主。然而，问题来了：尽管如此，为什么人们仍然对国王如此着迷？为什么古老的传说对我们仍具有如此强大的影响力？不仅如此，为什么它们至今仍有如此大的影响？

为什么在那些仍然保留某种王室或王族的国家里，人民痴迷于王室；而在像美国这样的没有国王、没有王族的地方，我们却要创造一个。我们会把亿万富翁、运动员、媒体明星甚至罪犯奉为国王，给他们加冕，让他们主持法庭，崇拜他们。为什么会有那么大一部分人口不断地将自己置于那些有魅力的领袖手中，而这些领袖往往利用他们的影响力？为什么我们需要国王？

为什么我们要加冕他们？为什么我们要创造他们？为什么我们要崇拜他们？我不能深入探讨这个问题。

这就是我要说的，在之后的问题时间里，可能会有人想问我关于这个话题。基督徒知道《圣经》告诉我们，民主是良药，不是食物。我们不能靠吃药生存。它只是药物。

我们不得不实行民主，因为人类如此罪恶，没有谁能真正胜任统治。但**我们需要一个国王。**我们是为国王而生的。旧神话之所以存在，新神话之所以兴起，所有关于超级英雄的神话都是关于国王的新神话。

我们崇拜国王并创造他们，是因为人类种族中有一种记忆痕迹。这种记忆痕迹在你我心中铭记着一位伟大的国王、古代的国王，他以如此强大的力量、智慧、怜悯和公正统治着世界，他的力量、智慧、怜悯和荣耀如同太阳般辉煌。我们知道我们是被造来臣服于那位国王的。我们是被造来奉献给那位国王的。

我们是被造来站在他面前敬拜、服侍并认识他的。这就是圣经所说的。圣经说，在诸王之上有一位君王，在诸王之后也有一位君王。在所有那些传说中，即使是最伟大的国王也只是对那记忆痕迹的一种微弱反映。

圣经还说，如果你拒绝那位真正的君王，你终将找到一位君王，因为你必须如此。即使你在理智上否认有真君王的存在，你也无法从你的本性、心理上否认这一点。你会找到一个要敬拜的人。你会找到救世主。

你会找到国王。这是我最近一个月读过最感人的文章之一。杰弗里·施马尔斯是《纽约时报》的作家，他患有艾滋病，至少一年都在为报纸撰文，今年秋天去世了。就在两、三周前，《纽约时报杂志》在星期天刊登了他的最后一篇文章，那篇文章非常引人入胜。

他在文中坦白说，在上一次总统选举之前，我感到如此尴尬，如果能有一个民主党人进入白宫，我就得救了。他说，我看着这位候选人，心想这就是我的白马王子。这将是我的救主。他会把所有资源聚集起来，找到治愈的方法，并在几个月后意识到自己是多么的愚蠢，多么的天真，怎么会这样想呢？

事情远没有那么简单。好吧，这就是我们在这里谈论的内容。圣经说：“你必看见你的君王。”“你必看见白骑士。

”“你必看见救主。”你必须这样做。这是你的本能，是记忆中的痕迹。亚瑟王、罗宾汉、仁慈的理查德国王、白宫里的民主党人，或者某个将来会来带你进入浪漫爱情的人，一个能拯救你的人，你需要一位君王。

如果你找不到真正的君王，你会创造一个假君王，这将毒害你的生活。亲爱的朋友们，你们的身体本能会得到满足。如果你不给身体提供食物，它最终会吃下毒药。它什么都吃。

同样地，如果你不给心灵提供它所需要的君王，它也会吃下毒药，但会吃下去。神说：“我已经立我的君王在锡安。”“我将我的君王赐给他全地。”在希伯来书中引用了诗篇2章。

希伯来书说：神真的会对哪个世俗的国王或天使说，“你是我的神和儿子”吗？对哪个天使，或者世俗的国王，甚至哪个天使，神会说，“整个大地都是你的产业”吗？希伯来书问：这只是宫廷夸张的说法吗？这只是另一种必须在加冕典礼上堆砌的奉承之词吗？

还是有可能神真的、完全地对某人说了这些话呢？可能真的有超越一切国王的真正君王，**真正的君王在所有国王的背后吗？在新约中，福音信息，基督教的信息是**：是的，确实有。有一个。

不仅是一个，弥赛亚，弥赛亚即将来临，基督，主已经膏立了一位受傅者。这是第一个要点：有一个**真正的君王。但第二个要点，在一至三节中教导我们，每个人自然的心灵都憎恨真正的君王。所以，你在这里可以看到一至三节的内容：为什么列国密谋，万民聚集是**徒然的？

君王们站起来了，执政者聚集起来对抗耶和华及祂所膏立的人。他们说了些什么呢？他们说：“让我们打破他们的锁链，甩掉他们的枷锁。”这是新国际译本的翻译。

那么，这句话意味着什么呢？当你以这种方式阅读时，可能会觉得耶和华和祂所膏立的人像囚犯一样被锁链束缚在监狱里。这可能是一个相当糟糕的翻译。当我研究这段经文时，我发现第二个词应该翻译为“轭”。

君王们并不是因为他们被锁链束缚而感到不满，而是因为有主人在统治他们。轭是用来套在牛身上的东西，马具则是用来套在马身上的。这里的意思是，有人拥有他们，有人要求他们被套上轭，有人因他们的创造而要求拥有他们的权利。这就是他们不想接受的。

他们说：“我想做自己的主人。”这正是第3节所教导的基本冲动，每一个人都有这种冲动。我认为这是苏格兰作家乔治·麦唐纳的观点，他启发了C.S.刘易斯。乔治·麦唐纳说过，地狱的核心信念只有一个：我是我的主人。

我认为他的意思是，每个人在地狱中的共同信念就是这一点，但这也是创造地狱的信念。这也将导致你在人际关系中、婚姻中、邻里间、社区里、生活中创造地狱。如果你以“我是我的主人”为原则行事，那就把轭卸下来吧。我属于我自己，你明白吗？

我是自己灵魂的船长，我是自己命运的主宰。这就是乔治·麦考密克所说的，也是每一个人都会感受到的本质。从一开始，如果你在抚养孩子，你就知道这一点完全影响并主导着每个人的思想、情感、决定和世界观。我是自己的主人。

摘下这个枷锁吧。因此，《圣经》也说我们厌恶国王的想法。我们厌恶有人对我们有支配权的想法。我们厌恶一个国王将枷锁加在我们身上，说你属于我。

你不是你自己，你必须听我的话。这就是《圣经》说人类不仅不信神，还憎恨祂的原因。约拿单·爱德华兹写了一整本书探讨这个问题，书名就叫《自然之人是神的仇敌》。这基于罗马书8章中的经文：“属乎血气的心灵是与神为仇的。

”你知道，在19世纪英国的一次布道中，最后的话是这样的：我的朋友们，如果美德化身出现在地上，我们都会跪下来崇拜他。这听起来真是太愚蠢了，不是吗？因为你知道美德化身确实出现在地上，那我们做了什么？我们逃跑了，我们掐住了祂，我们躲藏起来，我们钉死了祂，我们鞭打了祂，我们杀死了祂。

为什么要摘下这个枷锁呢？因为我们厌恶国王。有一个**真正的国王，但我们还是**憎恨祂。你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是关于一个迷失的弟弟。

事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是想对那些逃避神的人和那些试图通过做好人来赢得祂爱的人说些什么。（罗马书8:7, 19世纪英国布道的最后一句话，以及《浪子回头》故事的相关解释） 在《浪子的神》这本书中，提摩西·基勒（Tim Keller）展示了这个广为人知的故事如何揭示福音的核心信息——一个既为叛逆的小儿子也为严厉的大儿子带来希望的信息，并邀请所有人体验神那慷慨、无尽的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，浪子的神都会帮助你以全新的视角看待与基督的关系。浪子的神是我们对本月赠礼的感谢，这份礼物将使福音和生命能够向全世界的人分享耶稣仁慈而不懈之爱的希望和喜悦。

确实，有很多人对神漠不关心，并且很多人没有像应该的那样遵守神的命令。但是普通人的态度并非敌视，普通人并不恨神，也不与他为敌。真的吗？让我来回答这两个基本反对意见之一：人们说大多数人真正相信有神。

迈克尔·金斯利（Michael Kinzley）在《新共和》杂志上发表了一篇有趣的文章。他说他听到很多人认为美国对宗教的态度越来越敌视了，于是他就写了一篇文章表示这完全是胡说八道。他说他知道像华盛顿特区和曼哈顿这样的地方有很多不信神的人，但95%以上的美国人相信有神，并且在美国，在公共场合宣布你信神比宣布你不信神更容易。当然，这取决于你在纽约还是皮奥里亚（Peoria）。

我当然知道，但他想说的是，现在相信上帝很流行。大多数人相信上帝，人们也不排斥上帝或宗教。这是一个非常有宗教信仰的国家。他错了，因为他定义得不对。

圣经并没有说人们厌恶上帝的概念或思想。不，不，不。但圣经说人们憎恨圣经中的上帝。你看，是那个从西奈山雷鸣着说你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的上帝。

不可有别的神在你面前。是那个雷声轰鸣说我不容许无罪之人逃脱惩罚的上帝。还是那个赐给我们救世主的上帝，而救世主来了之后说了什么？他说除非你恨你的父母，否则不能成为我的门徒。

你知道**这意味着什么吗？他告诉你，你要如此爱我，以至于对任何其他人的感情在与之相比时都会显得像仇恨。**这就是你必须爱我的程度。我必须是你生命中的至高无上者。

我必须是你的第一要务。我必须对你生活的每一个方面都有绝对的控制权。上帝说，这就是圣经中的上帝，他给你套上了枷锁，说我是你的主人，我是你的创造者，你是属于我的。这就是圣经中所说的人们所憎恨的那种上帝。

而肯定有一些人听到我说这些时会感到不安。你知道吗，你已经开始坐立不安了。你说，天哪，这是多么原始的观点！我正是要说明这一点。

当人们面对圣经中的上帝的描绘、表达和启示时，这通常是他们的正常反应，不仅仅是对一般意义上的神。如果我开始这么说，你会相信圣经中的上帝吗？那个在雷鸣中说你们要圣洁，因为我是圣洁的上帝；那个说我不容许无罪之人逃脱惩罚的上帝。普通人会怎么说？

95% 说自己相信上帝的人会说什么？你知道他们会说什么吗？他们说，我相信一个爱的上帝。我正是要说明这一点。

圣经却说我们憎恨那位君王般的上帝，憎恨那位说你是我的财产的上帝。所有的地方都是我的财产。看，第八节说的就是我拥有你。这就是我们拒绝的那种上帝。

要小心，你们可能会犯的一个错误。有些人说，哦，好吧，那些恨国王的人是怀疑论者或已经拒绝宗教和基督教的人，并不一定如此。不要忘了这一点。弗兰纳里·奥康纳的一篇故事中有一段很好的描述：他说自己内心深处有一种深沉、黑暗的无言信念，即避免耶稣的方法是避开罪恶。

我对此印象深刻极了。这句话太棒了。这是一个深刻的见解。现在，我已经用过这段话了，但让我再展示一下我是如何应用它的。

她说，这里有个非常宗教的人。他认为避免耶稣的方式是尽可能地做好事和保持道德。为什么呢？你看，许多人利用宗教来避开耶稣。

他们用宗教来避开国王。让我这样告诉你：你认为自己是一个不错的人吗？你觉得自己比大多数人更好吗？你觉得你是一个讲诚信、有道德标准并且能坚持的人吗？

你觉得如果上帝现在出现并决定谁可以进入他的天堂，你会觉得自己和任何人一样有机会吗？还是你认为自己是一个无助的罪人，没有任何希望被上帝接纳，除非是耶稣为你而死，你唯一的希望就是上帝在耶稣基督中的怜悯？你是无助的罪人，还是认为你自己是个不错的人呢？你不觉得吗？

你在用道德。如果是前者，你是在用道德来避开耶稣。这样可以避免真正依赖他，避免真正地向他屈服。我告诉你们，无论是通过道德和宗教，还是通过怀疑论和放纵的生活方式，人们都恨国王，并且通过试图避开国王来表达这种仇恨，他们否认并压抑自己的愤怒。

所以这里我们要继续讨论，但有一个结论性的观点。你怎么知道你是一个基督徒呢？你怎么知道自己是否像这样被圣灵引导呢？你知道自己恨上帝吗？

你看到你的仇恨了吗？你是否看到自己生命中对神的敌意？你是否意识到，你有多么憎恨那轭？当你听到耶稣基督这位超级巨星对希律说：“出去吧，王，离开我的生活。

”时， 你知道这是你内心的声音吗？如果你知道你恨神，如果这占据了你的心，这就证明你是基督徒。只有基督徒才能承认这一点。唯有圣灵能使你面对被压抑的创伤记忆。

如果你今天不承认自己是神的敌人，那你实际上就是神的敌人。成为祂朋友的唯一途径就是承认你是祂的敌人。要认识圣灵在你生命中的工作，就必须看到这种怨恨：我们有国王，但我们憎恨国王；最后，**我们需要国王。**经文10、11和12节说：“看哪，如果你看见自己有国王，同时又憎恨国王，唯一的出路就是说服自己需要这位国王。

侍奉国王，亲吻国王，喜乐于国王。” 但请注意，经文10、11和12节并没有中间道路。你可以选择侍奉、喜乐并亲吻国王，从而在祂那里找到避难所和祝福；或者你不会侍奉，不喜乐，也不亲吻国王，最终会灭亡。你会被自己选择的道路毁灭。

你的立场是一个巨大的声明。有句话说：“没有逃避国王的庇护。” 只有在国王那里才有庇护。你看，没有中间道路。

没有逃避国王的庇护，只有在国王那里才有庇护。你需要这位国王。你必须被说服这一点。让我这样告诉你：经文10、11和12节的原则是，轭最终会成为避难所，束缚最终会变成宽敞的空间，服侍最终会带来自由。

如果你认为轭是捆绑和奴役而将其摘下，你会发现你会灭亡。你需要那轭。事实上，轭是进入自由的唯一途径。所以，让我们举一个简单的例子：假设这里有一位年轻女士，她想成为一名伟大的音乐家。

所以，也许是你自己，或者她自己，或者是她的父母，你看到了她那伟大的艺术天赋，并希望这天赋能够得到实现。那你该怎么做呢？她每天都要背着琴练几个小时。有些时候她想去练，有些时候不想去；有些时候她喜欢练习，有些时候又不喜欢。

但无论如何，每一天她都得背着琴，背着她的练习。随着时间的推移，这个负担反而成了她的避风港。你明白吗？随着时光流逝，她的艺术技能开始绽放，她能够以从未有过的表达方式来展现自己。

如果没有经过日复一日的常规训练和那些枯燥乏味的练习，这一切本不可能实现。这个负担变成了庇护所，变成了祝福。让我告诉你，没有什么比孩子来找你说：“妈妈，爸爸，你为什么没有让我多练琴？”“你为什么没有让我多学习？

”“我的潜力被毁了，机会已经错过了。”更令人悲伤的事情了。唯一能对孩子说的话是：因为你知道，最终你是无法强迫他们去做的。这个负担必须由他们自己来承担。

我不能让你练琴，不能让你学习，不能向你展示这个负担是如何解放他们的。没有什么比这更悲剧的了。你看，这个比喻是怎么运作的？圣经说，在每个人身上都有潜力，有潜能的东西。

如果你愿意进入王的领域和你未曾知晓的地方，你的头盔会绽放光彩。只有在承受国王的轭下，你的潜力才会显现出来。相信并顺从一个国王意味着你能找到自我。**这意味着你不再掌控自己的生活。**

但这正是同一件事。你是背着这个轭的。这就是事实。这就是意味着你要进入王的领域。

圣经说，因为你需要一个国王，你无法通过心理学来理解自己，也无法通过文化来理解自己，除非你认识到自己被这种对国王的需求所驱使。你在试图回到卡美洛。并且你没有其他选择。因此，除非你能顺服于你的本分所在，否则你会在错误的路上灭亡。

你明白吗？直到你完全彻底地将自己奉献给君王，君王，直到你毫无保留地把自己交给他？圣经说，你的心就像一个八缸发动机只用了一个气缸。你试过这样吗？

它会冒烟、费油、摇晃、停滞不前，非常糟糕，不是吗？你的两个最深的需求是：你需要感觉自己有价值，正在做些什么；你也需要感到被爱，有人认为你是有价值的。当你侍奉君王并亲吻君王时，只有那时这两个需求才会得到满足，因为当你服事他时，他也服事你；当你亲吻他时，他也亲吻你。这就是在关系中的情况。

然后啊，那些依靠他的，是有福的。现在让我给你举几个实际的例子来结束这段话。圣经在这里第10、11和12节告诉我们真正顺服君王意味着什么。我只给你讲四个要点，之后我会简要说明，如果有人想详细讨论，可以在问答环节中进行。

你如何对待耶稣这位君王？很多人只是以一般的方式相信了耶稣，甚至向耶稣寻求帮助，但你们并没有把他当作君王来对待。这就是为什么你们在生活中没有感受到祝福的原因。你需要把祂当作君王来对待。

如果你想这样对待他，你需要做到四件事：顺服、顺从、依靠和期待。顺服、顺从、依靠和期待。首先，顺服。也许这太简单了，我可能不需要花太多时间在上面，但请听我说。

顺服。有些人以为自己在顺服，其实并没有。如果你说：“好的，这里有规则。” 看看君王说了什么：总是原谅别人，永远；总是说实话，永远； 永远以善报恶，不要用恶报恶；把性视为承诺、永恒独身婚姻契约的更新仪式；不要嫉妒。

这样翻译保留了原文的格式和语气，并且尽量保持自然流畅。不要心怀怨恨，现在他们就在那里。看看，这房间里没有一个人，我们也没有人能够完美地遵守那些规定。但是，真正信耶稣为王的人和把耶稣当作顾问的人之间是有区别的。

你看，当我去见某些人时，你们中有些人现在正心怀怨恨，对别人生气而无法释怀。你们在重放过去的录像带。你们不肯饶恕。你知道应该饶恕，但就是做不到。

这样下去你会灭亡的。你试图摆脱那轭，难道你看不出来吗？他的轭是轻松的。他的担子是轻省的。

如果你饶恕，顺服并饶恕，这会治愈你的伤痛，因为这是有区别的。有时我去见人，我能看出你不肯饶恕。他们说：“那你打算怎么办？”一个基督徒总是会说：“我需要帮助。

” 我知道这样不对。我拒绝了。我必须去做。我要怎么做？

但另一个人会说：“我知道这样做不对，但这人应该受到惩罚。”“不要告诉我如何生活。” 如果你说：“我会顺服，如果感觉好我就顺服，如果实际可行我就顺服，如果受欢迎我就顺服，如果合乎实际我就顺服。”那你根本没有顺服。

耶稣没有成为你生命中的王。他只是你的顾问，在给你建议时，你却决定自己要和谁睡觉，何时饶恕，做什么或不做什么。他是顾问，而不是国王。你怎么能这样对待他？

看看他是谁。你不该顺从，而应该把他当作国王来侍奉。你要顺服他。你要说：“不是我的意志，而是你的意志成就。

”第二点，要把他当作国王来侍奉，你必须接受并顺服。要顺从他在你生命中所安排的方式。这更难。这就是我提到这一点的原因，兄弟，简短地说。

有些人非常顺从耶稣所说的，但当上帝让你经历一些你觉得不对、不公平的事情时，你会想：“这不是对的。”你看他如何让我的生活状况发展。这样你就不会把他当作国王来侍奉了。你知道怎样尊他为王吗？

要知道，这不仅仅是脸上挂着微笑说：“我正在赞美耶稣。”一切都很顺利。上帝当然知道该怎么做。你必须挣扎，必须奋斗。

但你知道吗？你必须像约伯一样。在《约伯记》第23章有一个非常精彩的地方，在他最好的时光之一和所有的挣扎中，他说：“我不感觉神的同在。” 但是，神允许发生的事情让我感到恐惧。

但他知道我的道路，在他试验我之后，我会像精金一样出现。但神知道我的道路，在他试验我之后，我会像精金一样出现。他在那里做了什么？他在自己的生命中接受耶稣为王，他说：“我不明白发生了什么事，这让我害怕，我在挣扎，但我知道如果我顺服地回应，如果我接受他给我的一切，如果我在这个巨大的火炉中忠心，我会像精金一样出现。

我会变得更谦卑。” 我会更敏感。我会更有爱心。我会更有同情心。

他承认自己的处境在净化自己。你愿意这样尊耶稣为王吗？好的。首先，顺服。

其次，你要接受这些处境。第三，当你听到“亲吻太阳”的时候，要依靠他。你知道**这意味着什么吗？如果你把任何东西加到耶稣身上作为快乐的条件，如果你把任何东西加到耶稣身上作为快乐的条件，那就是你的真正君王。**

你看到，如果你说：“只要我的生活中发生这些事情，我才会成为基督徒。”很多时候，你会因为生活中的某些问题而来到基督教，这些问题是对你来说很重要的。然后你去耶稣那里说：“我会为你做这件事，但请给我那个吧？”如果生活没有按照那个方向发展，那些事情没有发生在你身上，你就准备放弃一切，说：“我保持手纯洁是徒劳的。

我洗我的手和心，保持无辜是徒劳的。” 吻王意味着什么？**这意味着顺服他、屈膝于他，因为你被他的美丽所吸引。****这意味着你会说，没有什么比我的王更让我爱了。**

**这意味着我不把我的王当作达到目的的手段，而是相信王的爱本身就已经足够。**最后，顺服、屈膝、依靠，还有一件事，就是期待和战战兢兢地欢喜。那又意味着什么呢？我相信，如果你对耶稣在你生命中能做什么过于悲观，你就没有把他当作国王来对待。

你需要有配得上国王的期望。一个国王正要进入你的生活。你知道约翰牛顿曾说过：“向王求恩典和能力的大请愿是无人可以过分的。”你是否像对待国王一样看待他？

还是你看着生命中的问题说，那里什么都不会发生呢？那将永远如此。向王求恩典和能力的大请愿是无人可以过分的。如果你对耶稣在你生命中能做什么和通过你所能做到的事情过于悲观，你就没有把他当作国王来对待。

你能侍奉他吗？你能顺服他吗？你能吻他吗？你能战战兢兢地欢喜吗？

在他的面前没有避难之处，但有极大的避难之所。蒙福的是那些在王那里找到避难的人。让我们祷告：父啊，当我们思考这些事情时，因为**这是你的道，请你的灵来开启我们的心扉，使我们知道如何应用这些真理**。我祈求这里每一个人，在他们吻王、出于爱顺服他的时候，能够发现生命的大门已经敞开。

原谅我们想要卸下轭的渴望。让我们看到轭成为避难所，束缚变为宽广的空间，服务是你完美的自由。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。感谢你收听蒂姆·凯勒在《福音与生活播客》上的分享。
