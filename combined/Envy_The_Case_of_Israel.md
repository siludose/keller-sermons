# Envy The Case of Israel / Envy The Case of Israel

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Some people say the fundamental problem of the world is poverty. Others say it's bad systems, poor education, or biology, but what if none of these can fully explain the brokenness we see, both in the headlines and in our own hearts?

In today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. The teaching this morning is based on a text that is printed in the bulletin. It's a brief text.

Just give you a little background when we print such a brief text. It's Numbers, Chapter 11, verses 45 and 6. This happens in the midst of a fairly long narrative that many of you are familiar with the broad contours of Israel, the Israelites, were the slave labor force of Egypt.

They were in Egypt and they helped build under the lash the great pyramids and many of the great, not the great pyramids necessarily, but the many great works of architecture in ancient Egypt. But they were slaves. They were cruelly oppressed.

They were beaten. They were killed. When they got too numerous, many of their children were slaughtered.

It was a terrible situation. But God through Moses led them out through miraculous signs, passed through the Red Sea. But on their way to Canaan, on their way to their promised land, they had to go through a wilderness of desert.

And in the desert there was no food at all, no food at all. God made a provision for them. And it was called Manna.

And Manna was a very odd phenomenon. It came down with the dew. We were told every morning, six mornings of the week, not the last morning.

And it lay on the ground, and we're told it looked like coriander seed and it looked like resin. It was light. It could be made into cakes.

It was the only thing they had to eat. But it's what they were able to sane themselves with. But now we come to a situation in which we're told that children of Israel began to cry out against God, the God who was providing for them the wilderness.

And this is what they said. The rabble with them began to crave other food. And again, the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat.

We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost. Also the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. But now we've lost our appetite.

We never see anything but this Manna. This is God's word. Never before have people been more willing to admit that humankind is sick.

There's something. There's a sickness in us. We are cruel to each other.

We visit each other with cruelty in ways that we cannot seem to heal. We have an inveterate kind of unhappiness in our hearts that we can't seem to put out. And for the last 100 years, I would say the ruling western understanding of why we are so cruel and why we are so unhappy, the reigning understanding has been that it's an environmental thing.

That it comes from that which is from outside of us. That it comes from conditions. But now in the last few decades, especially the last 10 years or so, increasingly the intelligentsia, the smart people, the philosophers, the thinkers have been increasingly willing to admit that there's something deeper than that.

They might actually be beginning to say it could be that Shakespeare was right when he said the fault of your Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that there's something in us. And the Bible, of course, for centuries has been saying that the problem with human beings is not environmental, it's essential that there is a poison in us. It's called sin.

And that poison, as Dorothy Sayers, remember we refer to this a few weeks ago, Dorothy Sayers described, defined it sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul. And this poison, poisons us so deeply, and there are symptoms of poison. When you take poison before you actually finally die, symptoms, your symptoms.

And if you want to understand whether you're poisoned or not, you have to understand the symptoms. And you will never understand your own life, you will never understand society, you will never understand human beings, you will never understand life unless you understand the symptoms of sin. And I think in this series we've been looking at various ways in which the poison of sin distorts our lives.

And it's a very hopeful series, I think, because you see, only if you understand these symptoms, only if you understand the nature of them and the source of them will you understand the antidote for them. So today, let's just take a look at one more major symptom of the poison of sin. Let's look at the symptom and the root cause and the antidote for it.

The symptom, the root cause and the antidote, and the symptom is envy. We see it here in this story about the children of Israel and the wilderness. And right away, I know that the word envy doesn't mean a lot to you, it doesn't fill you with fear and shaking, because we tend to define envy in a very narrow way.

We think of envy as just jealousy, very conscious jealousy of somebody else's money or something like that. I'd like to show you that the Bible teaches us that envy is far more pervasive than that, if far more destructive than that, far more deep and dangerous than that. The problem that these people had, the rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat.

We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost and the cucumbers, the melons, the leaks, the onions and the garlic. Now in verse six, if you look at this, I like the new international version of the Bible at translation that we usually print in the bulletin, and it's still my favorite version, and I'm happy to recommend it. This is one of those few times when I have to say the translation here is most unfortunate.

Literally they say, our souls are dried up. Now this is a very free rendering and an unfortunate one. Literally our souls, and the Hebrew word for soul that they use here, Nephese is the word that means their life force, you know what they're saying?

Our souls are dried up. It says, we are dying because we have nothing but this man up. We are dying.

We're feeling faint. We're feeling sick. This isn't enough to sustain us.

Our souls are dried up. Now what are they talking about? It's something fairly simple.

Envy is a condition that deeply poisons us, that makes us unable to enjoy what's in front of us ever. Unable to ever sit down and live in the moment and rejoice in what we have, but to find fault with it and to say this isn't enough. This isn't good enough.

Envy is that cast of mine, sometimes it's stronger, sometimes it's weaker. It's stronger in some people than others. It's stronger.

It's sometimes in your life than others. But it's there because we're all sinners, we're all poisoned with this. Envy is that thing which keeps us from being able to sit down with that which is in front of us and enjoy it.

We find out what's wrong. It's not good enough. In other words, envy is that condition of heart that says, back there, over there, out there I could be happy, but what I've got right now, it's not good enough.

Look at the flaws. Look what's wrong with it. See, over there if I had that condition, if I had that situation I could be happy.

Back there, I could be happy if it was like it used to be, out there. If only things could happen in this way, but right now the way it is right now, it's not good enough. See, look at the Israelites.

This is funny, I guess. When they were in Egypt, they said, yes, we have lots of food, and it's free, of course, there are slaves that didn't pay any money for it. And it came, the fish and the leeks and the lemons and the melons and all that.

Well, it was free, but when they were there they said, but what good is all this free food, when you're not free. But now they're free, and what are they saying? What good is our freedom, if we're going to starve?

When they were back there, out there I can be happy, but right now this isn't good enough. When they were out there, back there I could have been happy, but right now it's not good enough. I'll make you laugh some more.

There's some people who think that New Yorkers have more of a problem with this than most anybody else. There's a theory. Anybody read the couple of weeks ago, New York Times Magazine, an article by John Tierney called Picky, Picky, Picky, do you see that?

He says that New Yorkers in particular have what he calls the internal flawomatic. Now, flawomatic is that, which focuses on the flaws, focuses on the faults, focuses on what's wrong, so we say, I hate this, this is not good enough. Now we use it on restaurants, we use it on art, we use it on our friends, we use it on our career, but he says, we go absolutely crazy when we use it on dates, when we use it on people, we're thinking about dating or we're sizing up as a prospective date or a mate or a companion.

And he puts it this way, he says, for example, he recounts one New Yorker talking to another New Yorker that he heard this, about a blind date that he had. He says, well, he says it's start out great, she opened the door, and she looked fantastic. Beautiful face, great body, nice smile, everything looked great, until she turned around, Chuck he said, she had dirty elbows.

And that was that, the guy went through with the rest of the date, but he knew the relationship possibilities were absolutely doomed. At first I thought, you know, there's some way maybe to work this out, some therapy, some soap and water, but then I realized it wouldn't matter, he'd find something else wrong. This is continuing to quote, it was like what I'd been hearing from my friends in New York for years and about why the latest relationships had gone wrong.

One said to me, well, she's really seemed intelligent, but then she mispronounced Gerta. And I knew she was faking it. Another said, there's no future for us, it's obvious to everybody that she should lose about seven pounds, but she doesn't seem to notice.

Everyone said, oh, sure, he's a partner, but it's not a very big firm, and besides that he wears these little short black socks that make his legs show when he crosses his legs. For years I knew my own requirements and a woman were absolutely reasonable, all I wanted was a nice novelist slash astronaut with a background in fashion modeling, but I couldn't see, I could see that all my other friends were much, much too picky, picky, picky. Now you laugh, my friends, a headache might be a symptom of just having no driven without your sunglasses, you know, or it might be a symptom of a brain tumor.

It might be something very light and passing or it might be something very deep. And the Bible says that yeah, maybe in New Yorkers, it's worse. In fact, Tierney actually says something, I think very, very powerful and right.

He says, why are we like this? Why are we worse than other places? Why do we do this to ourselves?

Why do we do this to people? Why this cosmic, phlegmatic? And he says maybe New York drives inhabitants crazy, maybe close encounters with wealth and glamour distort our vision.

But all he's saying is it's worse here. See, the Bible says this is not a symptom of driving without sunglasses. This is a symptom of a cancer that's eating away at your insides.

It's a cancer that's eating away totally at your insides. This is very powerful. He says our vision is distorted, says the author.

That's right. Look at this. They say our souls are dried up, okay?

They say our souls are dried up. We had it better in Egypt. Now look, you see the distortion?

They are so focused on the flaws. They are so focused on what's wrong. They're so focused on this.

They're completely distorted in their memory. How can they... We had it better in Egypt.

It was free. The food was free. Of course the food was free.

You were in chains. How could you overlook the slaughter of your children? But we had it better in Egypt.

How could they be so distorted? The writer is right. There's something in us.

There's a cosmic phlegmatic. It's going crazy here. We hate this stuff.

We hate our situation. It's not good enough. We had it better.

Let me show you just how powerful it is. The ultimate example of it. Is the Garden of Eden.

Here's Adam and Eve. They're there to show you yourself. Here's Adam and Eve.

And they're in paradise. And it's a perfect place. There's no death.

There's no disease. There's nothing wrong. Everything is perfect.

And yet through the serpent, the thought comes to them. Are you able to do anything you want? No, they say not anything.

We're not allowed to eat that tree. Anything else. We can do anything else.

We can eat anything else, but not that tree. And here comes the thought back. How bad it's the best one.

I'll bet it's better than all the other trees put together. And they were unsatisfied. And they felt I can think of a better situation than the Garden of Eden.

What do you think this means? Listen, I don't care on how unhappy you are right now with your circumstances. If you understand what the Bible is telling you, it is telling you that if you were to pick yourself up and put yourself down in the Garden of Eden with your heart in the same sinful condition as in now, you'd find something wrong with that.

That's what sin does. It makes you look for the fault. It makes you look for the flaw.

It makes you reject it. It makes you... Nothing is good enough.

Nothing is good enough. And so you're miserable. And you think about it like that.

So, this is the reason why some of us never get married or when you do get married, you're always unhappy with the one you're married to. This is the reason some of us are so driven in our career because we hate the wrong on the latter we're at. This is the reason some of you can't stand the way you look in the mirror.

This is the reason why many of us have such critical spirits toward other people. This is the reason why some of you can never join a church. Picky, picky, picky.

And of course you're going to find it. This is the reason why you're constantly having mid-life crises. And you're only in your early 20s.

Ah, because, you know, I just need a change. I don't like the way I am out there, back there. It's poisoning your life.

You can never sit down and enjoy what's in front of you. You can never sit back and just receive what you've got. To one degree and another, we're all suffering from it.

That's the symptom. Well, you say, well, what's the root of it? I can sort of see why this is kind of making my life a gray thing, a gray situation.

This kind of unhappy, always kind of gray and irritated and itchy and irritable and unhappy and critical of everybody and everything around. What's the root of it? Well, the root of it is the particular poison, but here's what the particular poison is.

You don't trust God further than you can throw him. You can't throw God even an inch. At the heart of why we are continually unhappy with everything and why we can never enjoy anything and why we're always miserable to one degree and other and never able to...

I mean, things are great at first, but then they wear, huh? They don't wear out. You say, I want something new.

I want something better. I want something... The reason for it, the Bible says, is the ultimate poison is you don't trust God.

You don't trust Him. You don't see His trust worthy. And if anybody here says that's not true of me, you don't know your own heart.

There's not a lot of things that I'm sure of. I only choose the things that I'm absolutely sure of. I can only get about 30 minutes worth a week together for you.

And I try to stick with those things that I'm ready to die for and the things that I'm absolutely sure of. And here's one I'm absolutely sure of. Your heart, my heart, doesn't trust God at all.

And if you don't know that, if you don't see that, and if you don't realize that this is the root of so many of your problems that you don't trust Him to be out for your best, you don't know your heart. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In His brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer.

Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us. And how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Look at what they say, they say, our souls are dried up, why? Because we see nothing but this man up now. See what he's saying?

This is what they're saying. Because we have nothing but what God has given us, we're drying up. If we take only what God's given us, we're going to dry up.

If we rely only on what God has done, if we rely wholly on him, if we center wholly on him, we're going to die. It won't be enough. Now, by the way, this is an absolute lie.

In Deuteronomy 8, when their wilderness wanderings are done, God comes to them and He actually says, during the time you were in the wilderness, your feet did not swell. Now, you know, if you don't know this number's 11 passage and you don't know a little bit about biology and anatomy and physiology, you won't know what in the world's going on. Your feet swell up when you don't have a proper nutrient scurvy, for example, made your feet swell.

You didn't have enough vitamin C. What God is doing is He's coming back in Deuteronomy 8 and He's saying, in spite of what you have said, the manna was enough. You didn't think it was enough, but it was.

I fed you on, manna. It had every nutrient you needed, it had all the vitamins you needed, it had everything you needed. But, well, then what are they saying here?

They're saying, but we feel faint. We feel like we're drawing up, but it's not that hard to see. If two or three people get together and say, hey, let's tell them so and so that she looks terrible.

And if you do that over and over again, you know, call them up, talk to her, after while she starts to feel sick, of course she will. And that's funny, but this is not funny. This is exactly what we do with sin.

We look at our lives because this is what they did. They decided the manna wasn't enough, and therefore they felt sick. This isn't enough.

I'm feeling faint. I'm feeling nauseated. This man isn't enough.

And of course, they talked themselves into it. They really were sick. They really did feel that way.

That's exactly what we do in sin. You look around your life and say, there's not enough beauty here. There's not enough success here.

There's not enough love here. And if you tell yourself that, you'll start to feel faint and you will feel sick and you will start to pass out. You talk yourself into it.

And you know why? Underneath it all, we say, God, if I just trust God, I will dry up. Now somebody says, I don't believe that.

Let me show you how basic this is to all of our problems. Let me give you a very religious person and a very irreligious person, just for a second. A very, very irreligious person in New York City, for example, will say, what?

Obey the Tank Commandments, go to church, get down on my knees and confess on the center, pray, give my money away, no sex outside of merit, hey, religion, I want to enjoy life. What is that? If I obey God wholly and completely without fudging, without cutting any corners, I'll dry up.

They believe that. That's an assault, they laugh and they say it's an assault on the goodness of God. It is.

And there's many of you who are saying the same thing. I know what the Bible says, but I got to cut this corner. I know the Bible says I shouldn't do this, but I have to.

I know the Bible says I shouldn't, but I know the Bible says I shouldn't. I know what religion says, I know what Christianity says, but I really can't. I've got to supplement myself if I only do nothing but what God says, I'll dry up.

Nothing but this manna, won't be enough. On the other hand, let me show you a religious person. The typical religious person is somebody who's always feeling kind of guilty, always feeling kind of anxious.

Say something, you know, you say, you can be received by God not on the basis of anything you do, not on the basis of your good works, but surely and strictly and completely because Jesus died for you and loves you. And if you trust in Him instead of your own good works for your salvation, He'll receive you. You know what they say?

You know what? Really, moralistic religious people say, that's too easy. They always say that, in fact, some of you are saying that, that's too easy, I don't believe that.

You've got to be good. I've got to add something of my own. Nothing but isn't enough, I'll dry up.

Don't you realize the person who doesn't believe God really forgives or the person who thinks obedience is just going to make my life, you know, it's going to hold me and I'm not going to be able to enjoy life if I'm totally obedient. Your life is poisoned by this. You don't trust God.

And because you don't trust God, do you see how it works? Because you don't trust God. The things that you turn to cannot fulfill you the way God did, the way God was supposed to.

You know, when David put on Saul's armor, it wasn't built for him. Remember that? Little David, before he went off to Goliath, Saul says, put on my armor, that'll protect you.

He put on his armor and the armor didn't fit him. You know, it chafed on him and it dragged him down and it impeded him. When you turn to things besides God, you don't trust God, nothing but the man.

You don't trust God to fulfill you say, I'm going to have to do this. I want this as well. I want this as well.

I want this as well. I want this as well. Those things will not fulfill you.

They will not satisfy you and you will find fault with them. You have to. They'll never satisfy, they'll never please.

And everything around you because you don't trust him. You will find fault with. You'll be picky, picky, picky.

Your flammatic will be going off all the time. Now what's the antidote? Well, here's the antidote.

What was their antidote? What they should have done if they had not despised the manor. If they had said, look at this great thing that God's given us.

Instead of saying, we wish we had fish, we wish we had leeks and onions and melons and garlic. Instead of they said, what a miracle this is. If they had focused, yeah, it's only one thing.

There's nothing wrong with saying, Lord, how about two kinds of manor? How about light meat and dark meat or something, light and dark manor, how about something else? Yeah, all right.

Manor, it's one thing, all right. But instead of focusing on that, the fact it was the same. Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was there?

Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was mercy? Why didn't they focus on the fact it was a miracle? Why didn't they focus on the mercy and goodness of God?

And if they had stopped despising with the spirit of Thanksgiving, the manor, then they would not have been talking themselves into their misery. Now what's the lesson here? The lesson is, if you are finding fault with everything, if you're looking out there and everything is bad or wrong, the Bible tells you it's because you have despised the true manor of heaven in some way.

The only reason we're unhappy with everything is because we've despised the true manor. Well, what's the true manor? Well Jesus had a conversation in John 6 and in John 6, they get together and they said to him, you know what, how do we know you're from God?

Our forefathers, they knew that God was with them because God sent the manor. How do we know God's with you? And Jesus says, you know the manor that Moses gave you?

That was good stuff, but it was just a symbol of the bread from heaven I can give you. And he says, do you know why your souls are so empty? Do you know why you can't feel happy about anything?

Do you know why nothing satisfies you? It's because you don't have this bread from heaven. It's because you don't have eternal life, a kind of joy and a kind of power and a kind of love that fulfills you.

If you eat this bread from heaven, the bread I give you, you will never hunger again. You know what they say? They said, sir, give us this bread.

If this is the reason why we can't find happiness anywhere, if this is the reason why nothing's good enough, give it to us and what did he say? I am the bread of life. I am the bread that comes down from heaven.

And you know what they immediately did? They despised him. They despised him.

You know what they said? They said, you aren't you the son of Joseph, aren't you the carpenter? Give me a break.

You can read that in John chapter 641. They despised him just like they despised this manor. And that's exactly the way Jesus Christ and the gospel itself has always been treated.

In New York City, if you bring this up, if you just say to the average person that you work with or that you study with or something, you say, I believe Jesus is the son of God. It came down from heaven to save us from our sins, that his blood is atone for our sins. And now if we receive him, we can be born again.

And what do they say? They don't say, well, this is a very interesting theory. Let's talk about it.

Oh no. They despise it. This manor.

They have contempt. You say they look down at it. You know, when Paul preached it, Paul, the great mind, he preached on, you know, at the area of apagus on Athens Hill.

What do they say to him? They say, oh, this is very interesting. They said, what does this babbler have to say?

And you know, when Jesus Christ himself moved through his life, they continually despised him. They treated him like the manor. They said, can anything good come out of Nazareth?

Nothing good comes out of Nazareth, right? And when he was crucified, he was mocked. They said, you say you're a king.

We'll treat you as a king. Here's a crown of thorns. And as they stood there bleeding, they said, hail king of the Jews.

You say you're a prophet? See? We'll see if you're a prophet.

They blindfold and they start beating him and they said, if you're a prophet, prophesy, who just hit you? Contempt. They despised him.

Isaiah 53 says, he was despised and rejected and we esteemed and not. But this is how he saved us. Because as we despised him, he refused to despise us.

As a matter of fact, this is the polar opposite to the flammatics in our heart. He didn't just refuse to despise us. He did the opposite.

You know what we do? We look past the good to hate things. He looked past our evil to love us.

There's this place in the movie, guarding tests. Any of you see that? Shirley McLean plays the widow of a president.

And she's guarded by a secret service agent and she insists on this one secret service agent, Nicholas Cage. And you know why? She knew what most people didn't know that her husband was unfaithful to her.

Her husband, the president, had been really quite a cad. And therefore, when he died in office, people wept but they didn't know him. They didn't know him.

But she knew that Nicholas Cage, the secret service agent, knew what kind of man he was, knew about all his flaws, knew what a coward in many ways he was, knew what a cad he was, but she saw him cry at the funeral. And she said, here's somebody who knew him, but still loved him. And that's why she insisted that he always stay by her side, because she also knew him, but still loved him.

That's the opposite of envy. And that's what Jesus Christ does. He knows you, says in John chapter 2, he knew it was in us and he didn't trust us.

He knows our sinful heart so much that he doesn't even trust us, but he's the opposite. He goes by the good to hate and focus on the flaws. He goes by the evil and he loves us anyway.

He refused to despise us, despisers. Now friends, do you understand that? I'll just close with two things.

First of all, some of you don't really maybe understand even the gospel. Here's the gospels right here. Jesus Christ is the bread of heaven.

Bread cannot make you whole unless it's broken. If you have looked at Jesus Christ as a kind of model or an example over the years that you emulate, he's a failure as a model. Do you know that?

You know why he's a failure? If you think to be a Christian is just to emulate him and just to try to be like him, he's a failure as a model. Because all he'll do is make you feel terrible.

You'll never live up to it. But if you see him as broken bread, if you break the bread, then you can be whole. If the bread stays whole, you starve.

If the bread is broken, you can be whole. If the bread is whole, you will stay broken. Jesus Christ says, I'm the bread of life.

I give my flesh for the life of the world until you see him as having been despised for you, paying for the fact that you're a despiser, paying for your sin. Until you see him as that, you'll never receive this new life. You'll never receive his love.

You'll never receive his joy. It'll never come into you and turn you into a whole different kind of person. One that knows how to look by the evil and a firm.

But now, Christian friends, all I can say to you is, you may say, I know this, why is my flawed manner going crazy still? And I'll tell you why is going crazy still? Because you're not remembering these things.

Friends, look at Jesus. Instead of focusing on the sins around people, you ought to be looking past it. You ought to be the easiest people in the world to be a failure in front of.

Are you the kind of person like Jesus who says the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak? I know you mean well. Or remember the woman caught in adultery?

What did he say? Neither do I condemn thee, but go and sin no more. Or are you the kind of person that, when somebody, you find something wrong with someone you're saying, I found you.

There it is. Are you an easy person to fail in front of? Are you an affirming person?

Are you a person who knows how to cover up people's nakedness? I don't mean not deal with it. I mean love them in spite of it.

If you can't, if you're not patient, if you're not able to enjoy with gratitude, what God has given you. If you're not able to sit down and enjoy it and live a life of gratitude, unless you're able to discipline yourself to look at all of life in gratitude, you've forgotten what he's done for you. You don't like the person that you're having to be thrown together with right now?

He say, ah, they give me the creeps. You gave Jesus the creeps. And he looked right past the creeps.

And he loved you. He refused to despise you. How can you despise them?

Are you unhappy with your situation right now? The fault, dear Brutus, is not in your stars. It's in yourselves.

You ought to look at your problems right now and say, look, there are things that I should change and I will change, but I'm not going to be miserable today. You know why? Because if I was in the Garden of Eden today, with my heart operating, the way my heart is operating, it would not be enough.

But Jesus is good enough. And he died for me to make me good enough even for the Father. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you'd help us to overcome the envy, that you'd help us to overcome it. And it was to overcome the fault-finding, the misery that is to great degree self-imposed, help us not to despise your son and the gospel, but help us to see that he refused to despise those who despised him so that we might become affirming people, people who live lives of affirmation and gratitude. Make us so we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。有些人说世界的根本问题是贫困。其他人说这是坏制度、教育不足或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们所看到的破裂——在新闻标题中和我们自己的心里——会怎样？在今天的教导中，蒂姆·凯勒看圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个既深刻诚实又令人难以置信的希望的观点。

我想讨论嫉妒。嫉妒是什么？嫉妒是当你看到某人拥有的东西，当你想要他们拥有的东西时的感觉，你开始变得苦涩和愤怒。现在，在我们的文化中，我们不常谈论嫉妒。

我们谈论很多其他的罪。我们谈论愤怒。我们谈论贪婪。我们谈论傲慢。

但我们不常谈论嫉妒。为什么？因为嫉妒很深，很秘密。嫉妒不是你能简单地看到的东西。

嫉妒发生在内心深处。嫉妒是关于你想要的东西而不能拥有。现在，让我给你圣经中嫉妒的例子。以色列是上帝的选民。

上帝给了以色列律法。上帝给了以色列圣殿。上帝给了以色列祭司。上帝给了以色列应许的土地。

以色列应该满足。以色列应该感谢。但以色列不是。以色列嫉妒。

以色列看着他们周围的其他国家，他们有他们不能拥有的东西。他们有王。他们有军队。他们有权力。

然后以色列开始嫉妒。以色列说："我们想要一个王。我们想要像他们一样。我们想要权力。

" 现在，这听起来可能没有那么糟糕。但这就是问题所在。以色列有上帝。以色列有上帝的保护。

但以色列想要其他国家拥有的东西。以色列不满足于与上帝在一起。而且，当以色列得到他们想要的王时，会发生什么？以色列变得像其他所有人一样糟糕。

以色列的王变得腐败。以色列的王变得自我中心。以色列的王制造了麻烦。所以嫉妒没有给以色列任何好处。

嫉妒只是让以色列沮丧。现在，这就是我想要指出的。嫉妒摧毁。嫉妒摧毁幸福。

如果你正在嫉妒，你不能快乐。你无法高兴地看到其他人拥有的东西。你无法为他们的成功而高兴。你被困在苦涩中。

嫉妒摧毁关系。如果你嫉妒你的朋友，你不能真正与他们相处。你开始对他们苦恼。你开始在他们身后说东西。

你开始想他们的坏事。嫉妒摧毁和平。如果你嫉妒，你不能在平静中。你被困在躁动和不满中。

现在，为什么我们嫉妒？我想给你几个原因。首先，我们嫉妒，因为我们相信谎言。谎言是什么？

谎言是我们的价值来自于我们拥有的东西。谎言是我们的价值来自于我们有多成功。谎言是我们的价值来自于他人如何看待我们。如果你相信这个谎言，那么当你看到有人拥有比你更多或比你更成功的东西时，你会嫉妒。

你会想："他们比我更有价值。他们比我更重要。" 但这不是真的。你的价值不来自你拥有的东西。

你的价值不来自于你的成功。你的价值来自于你被创造的事实。你的价值来自于你被上帝所爱。其次，我们嫉妒，因为我们比较。

我们看着其他人，我们比较他们的生活与我们的生活。我们看着他们的房子、他们的汽车、他们的工作、他们的关系，我们开始比较。而这总是危险的。你永远可以找到拥有比你更多的人。

你永远可以找到比你更成功的人。你永远可以找到有你想要的生活的人。如果你进行比较游戏，你总是会输。有人总是会比你"更好"。

第三，我们嫉妒，因为我们不满足。我们不感谢我们拥有的东西。我们不欣赏我们的生活。我们一直看着我们没有的东西。

我们一直想要更多。但满足来自感谢。满足来自欣赏你拥有的。满足来自看着你的生活，说："这很好。

我很高兴。" 现在，这如何改变？我们如何停止嫉妒？首先，**我们需要记住我们的价值。**

我们的价值不来自外部事物。我们的价值来自于我们被上帝所爱。我们的价值来自于基督为我们而死。我们的价值来自于我们是上帝创造的，他认为我们是有价值的。

当你这样想时，当你真的相信这个时，嫉妒开始失去它的力量。你开始不那么在乎他人拥有的东西。你开始更在乎你与上帝的关系。其次，**我们需要停止比较。**

**我们需要停止看别人的生活，并将其与我们自己的进行比较。****我们需要停止问"为什么他有那个而我没有？"我们需要在我们自己的生活中感到满足。**现在，这并不意味着我们不应该渴望变得更好。

这并不意味着我们不应该有目标。但**这意味着我们不应该痴迷于拥有别人拥有的东西。****这意味着我们应该专注于我们自己的旅程，而不是比较。**第三，**我们需要学会感谢。**

**我们需要看着我们的生活，看看我们拥有的，看看上帝给我们的，并说谢谢。**这可能很简单，就像感谢你有一个屋顶在你的头上。感谢你有食物吃。感谢你有爱你的人。

感谢你有工作。感谢你的健康。有很多东西要感谢。而当你做时，当你真的开始计算你的祝福时，嫉妒就开始消退。

你开始意识到你已经被祝福了。第四，**我们需要为他人的成功而高兴。**这很困难。当有人你知道的人成功时，很难为他们高兴，尤其是如果你正在为他们拥有你想要的东西而苦恼。

但圣经告诉我们去做。圣经说："与喜乐的人同乐。"圣经说我们应该为他人的成功而高兴。现在，为什么我们应该这样做？

因为当你为他人的成功而高兴时，当你开始为他人而庆祝时，当你开始看到他们的收获是好事时，你解放了自己。你停止了被嫉妒所奴役。你开始被爱所奴役。而爱比嫉妒更强大。

爱改变一切。所以，当我们离开这里时，我想问你：你正在嫉妒什么？有什么人或什么东西让你苦恼？有什么人或什么东西让你想说"为什么他有那个而我没有？

" 我邀请你投靠耶稣。我邀请你记住你的价值来自于他。我邀请你停止比较。我邀请你学会感谢。

我邀请你为他人的成功而高兴。因为当你这样做时，当你真的让这些事情改变你的心时，嫉妒就会开始消退。你会开始感到自由。
