## 症状：藐视神所赐之物 / The Symptom: Despising What God Gives

Just give you a little background when we print such a brief text. It's Numbers, Chapter 11, verses 45 and 6. This happens in the midst of a fairly long narrative that many of you are familiar with the broad contours of Israel, the Israelites, were the slave labor force of Egypt.

They were in Egypt and they helped build under the lash the great pyramids and many of the great, not the great pyramids necessarily, but the many great works of architecture in ancient Egypt. But they were slaves. They were cruelly oppressed.

They were beaten. They were killed. When they got too numerous, many of their children were slaughtered.

It was a terrible situation. But God through Moses led them out through miraculous signs, passed through the Red Sea. But on their way to Canaan, on their way to their promised land, they had to go through a wilderness of desert.

And in the desert there was no food at all, no food at all. God made a provision for them. And it was called Manna.

And Manna was a very odd phenomenon. It came down with the dew. We were told every morning, six mornings of the week, not the last morning.

And it lay on the ground, and we're told it looked like coriander seed and it looked like resin. It was light. It could be made into cakes.

It was the only thing they had to eat. But it's what they were able to sane themselves with. But now we come to a situation in which we're told that children of Israel began to cry out against God, the God who was providing for them the wilderness.

And this is what they said. The rabble with them began to crave other food. And again, the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat.

We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost. Also the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. But now we've lost our appetite.

We never see anything but this Manna. This is God's word. Never before have people been more willing to admit that humankind is sick.

There's something. There's a sickness in us. We are cruel to each other.

We visit each other with cruelty in ways that we cannot seem to heal. We have an inveterate kind of unhappiness in our hearts that we can't seem to put out. And for the last 100 years, I would say the ruling western understanding of why we are so cruel and why we are so unhappy, the reigning understanding has been that it's an environmental thing.

That it comes from that which is from outside of us. That it comes from conditions. But now in the last few decades, especially the last 10 years or so, increasingly the intelligentsia, the smart people, the philosophers, the thinkers have been increasingly willing to admit that there's something deeper than that.

They might actually be beginning to say it could be that Shakespeare was right when he said the fault of your Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that there's something in us. And the Bible, of course, for centuries has been saying that the problem with human beings is not environmental, it's essential that there is a poison in us. It's called sin.

And that poison, as Dorothy Sayers, remember we refer to this a few weeks ago, Dorothy Sayers described, defined it sin as a deep interior dislocation of the soul. And this poison, poisons us so deeply, and there are symptoms of poison. When you take poison before you actually finally die, symptoms, your symptoms.

And if you want to understand whether you're poisoned or not, you have to understand the symptoms. And you will never understand your own life, you will never understand society, you will never understand human beings, you will never understand life unless you understand the symptoms of sin. And I think in this series we've been looking at various ways in which the poison of sin distorts our lives.

And it's a very hopeful series, I think, because you see, only if you understand these symptoms, only if you understand the nature of them and the source of them will you understand the antidote for them. So today, let's just take a look at one more major symptom of the poison of sin. Let's look at the symptom and the root cause and the antidote for it.

The symptom, the root cause and the antidote, and the symptom is envy. We see it here in this story about the children of Israel and the wilderness. And right away, I know that the word envy doesn't mean a lot to you, it doesn't fill you with fear and shaking, because we tend to define envy in a very narrow way.

We think of envy as just jealousy, very conscious jealousy of somebody else's money or something like that. I'd like to show you that the Bible teaches us that envy is far more pervasive than that, if far more destructive than that, far more deep and dangerous than that. The problem that these people had, the rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, if only we had meat to eat.

We remember the fish we had in Egypt at no cost and the cucumbers, the melons, the leaks, the onions and the garlic. Now in verse six, if you look at this, I like the new international version of the Bible at translation that we usually print in the bulletin, and it's still my favorite version, and I'm happy to recommend it. This is one of those few times when I have to say the translation here is most unfortunate.

Literally they say, our souls are dried up. Now this is a very free rendering and an unfortunate one. Literally our souls, and the Hebrew word for soul that they use here, Nephese is the word that means their life force, you know what they're saying?

Our souls are dried up. It says, we are dying because we have nothing but this man up. We are dying.

We're feeling faint. We're feeling sick. This isn't enough to sustain us.

Our souls are dried up. Now what are they talking about? It's something fairly simple.

Envy is a condition that deeply poisons us, that makes us unable to enjoy what's in front of us ever. Unable to ever sit down and live in the moment and rejoice in what we have, but to find fault with it and to say this isn't enough. This isn't good enough.

Envy is that cast of mine, sometimes it's stronger, sometimes it's weaker. It's stronger in some people than others. It's stronger.

It's sometimes in your life than others. But it's there because we're all sinners, we're all poisoned with this. Envy is that thing which keeps us from being able to sit down with that which is in front of us and enjoy it.

We find out what's wrong. It's not good enough. In other words, envy is that condition of heart that says, back there, over there, out there I could be happy, but what I've got right now, it's not good enough.

Look at the flaws. Look what's wrong with it. See, over there if I had that condition, if I had that situation I could be happy.

Back there, I could be happy if it was like it used to be, out there. If only things could happen in this way, but right now the way it is right now, it's not good enough. See, look at the Israelites.

This is funny, I guess. When they were in Egypt, they said, yes, we have lots of food, and it's free, of course, there are slaves that didn't pay any money for it. And it came, the fish and the leeks and the lemons and the melons and all that.

Well, it was free, but when they were there they said, but what good is all this free food, when you're not free. But now they're free, and what are they saying? What good is our freedom, if we're going to starve?

When they were back there, out there I can be happy, but right now this isn't good enough. When they were out there, back there I could have been happy, but right now it's not good enough. I'll make you laugh some more.

欢迎来到生命福音。有些人说世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人说是糟糕的制度、糟糕的教育或生物因素，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在新闻头条和我们自己心中看到的破碎呢？

在今天的教导中，提摩太·凯勒探讨圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实而又极具希望的世界观。今天早上的教导基于一段印在周报上的经文。这是一段简短的经文。

让我给你们一点背景，当我们印这么简短的经文时。这是民数记第十一章，第4到6节。这发生在一个相当长的叙事中，你们许多人对其大致轮廓都很熟悉——以色列人是埃及的奴隶劳工。

他们在埃及，在鞭子下帮助建造了伟大的金字塔和许多伟大的建筑，不一定是伟大的金字塔，但许多古埃及伟大的建筑作品。但他们是奴隶。他们受到残酷的压迫。

他们被殴打。他们被杀害。当他们人数太多时，他们的许多孩子被屠杀。

这是一个可怕的处境。但神通过摩西，用神迹的记号带领他们出来，穿过红海。但在他们去迦南的路上，在他们去应许之地的路上，他们必须穿过沙漠旷野。

在沙漠里根本没有食物，一点食物都没有。神为他们做了供应。这叫做吗哪。

吗哪是一种非常奇特的现象。它随着露水降下。我们被告知每天早上，一周六个早晨，不是最后一个早晨。

它躺在地上，我们被告知它看起来像芫荽子，看起来像树脂。它很轻。可以做成饼。

这是他们唯一必须吃的东西。但这是他们能够用来维持自己的东西。但现在我们来到一个情况，我们被告知以色列的子民开始向神呼喊，向在旷野供应他们的神呼喊。

他们是这样说的。他们中间的闲杂人开始贪恋别的食物。以色列人又哭号说："谁给我们肉吃呢？

我们记得在埃及的时候不花钱就吃的鱼。还有黄瓜、西瓜、韭菜、葱、蒜。但现在我们的胃口没了。

我们除了这吗哪以外，什么也看不见。"这是神的话语。从来没有人比现在更愿意承认人类是有病的。

我们里面有某种东西。我们里面有一种疾病。我们彼此残忍。

我们以残忍对待彼此，这种方式我们似乎无法医治。我们心中有一种根深蒂固的不快乐，我们似乎无法消除。而在过去的100年里，我想说西方对于为什么我们如此残忍、为什么我们如此不快乐的主流理解，主导性的理解一直是这是一个环境问题。

它来自我们外部的东西。它来自环境条件。但现在在过去几十年里，特别是过去10年左右，越来越多的知识分子、聪明人、哲学家、思想家越来越愿意承认有比这更深的东西。

他们实际上可能开始说，也许莎士比亚是对的，当他说"亲爱的布鲁图斯，错不在我们的星宿，而在我们自己"——我们里面有某种东西。而圣经，当然，几个世纪以来一直在说人类的问题不是环境性的，而是本质性的——我们里面有一种毒素。这叫做罪。

而这种毒素，正如多萝西·塞耶斯，记得我们几周前提到的，多萝西·塞耶斯描述的，把罪定义为灵魂深处内在的错位。这种毒素如此深刻地毒害我们，毒素有症状。当你服毒之前你真正最后死去时，症状，你的症状。

如果你想了解你是否中毒，你必须了解症状。你永远不会理解你自己的生活，你永远不会理解社会，你永远不会理解人类，你永远不会理解生活，除非你理解罪的症状。我认为在这个系列中，我们一直在看罪的毒素如何以各种方式扭曲我们的生活。

这是一个非常充满希望的系列，我认为，因为你看，只有当你理解这些症状，只有当你理解它们的本质和它们的来源，你才会理解它们的解药。所以今天，让我们来看看罪的毒素的另一个主要症状。让我们看看症状、根源和解药。

症状、根源和解药，症状就是嫉妒。我们在这个关于以色列子民在旷野的故事中看到它。马上，我知道嫉妒这个词对你们来说意义不大，它不会让你们充满恐惧和颤抖，因为我们倾向于以一种非常狭隘的方式定义嫉妒。

我们认为嫉妒只是妒忌，非常有意识地妒忌别人的金钱或类似的东西。我想向你们展示，圣经教导我们嫉妒比那要普遍得多，比那更具破坏性，比那更深、更危险。这些人的问题是，他们中间的闲杂人开始贪恋别的食物，以色列人又哭号说："谁给我们肉吃呢？

我们记得在埃及的时候不花钱就吃的鱼，还有黄瓜、西瓜、韭菜、葱、蒜。"现在在第6节，如果你看这里，我喜欢圣经新国际版的翻译，我们通常印在周报上的翻译，这仍然是我最喜欢的版本，我很乐意推荐它。这是少数几次我不得不说这里的翻译非常不幸的时候之一。

字面上他们说，我们的心血枯竭了。现在这是一个非常自由的翻译，而且是不幸的。字面上"我们的心"，他们在这里使用的希伯来语灵魂一词，Nephesh这个词意味着他们的生命力，你知道他们在说什么吗？

我们的灵魂枯竭了。它说，我们正在死去，因为我们除了这吗哪什么都没有。我们正在死去。

我们感到虚弱。我们感到生病。这不足以维持我们。

我们的灵魂枯竭了。现在他们在说什么？这是相当简单的事情。

嫉妒是一种深深毒害我们的状态，使我们无法永远享受眼前的东西。无法坐下来活在当下，为我们所拥有的而欢喜，而是挑剔它，说这还不够。这不够好。

嫉妒是那种思维方式，有时它更强，有时它更弱。它在某些人身上比其他人更强。它有时在你的生活中比其他时候更强。但它就在那里，因为我们都是罪人，我们都被这毒害了。嫉妒是那种让我们无法坐下来享受眼前事物的东西。

我们发现哪里不对。还不够好。换句话说，嫉妒是那种心态，说："回到那里，在那边，在外面，我可以快乐，但我现在拥有的，还不够好。

看看缺陷。看看哪里不对。看，在那边，如果我有那个条件，如果我有那种处境，我就能快乐。

回到那里，如果像过去那样，我就能快乐，在外面。如果事情能以这种方式发生，但现在的方式，现在的样子，还不够好。看，看以色列人。

这很有趣，我猜。当他们在埃及时，他们说，是的，我们有很多食物，而且是免费的，当然，有奴隶，他们不用为此付钱。它来了，鱼、韭菜、柠檬、西瓜，所有这些。

嗯，它是免费的，但当他们在那里时，他们说，但当你不自由时，所有这些免费食物有什么用呢？但现在他们自由了，他们在说什么？如果我们要挨饿，我们的自由有什么用？

当他们回到那里时，"在外面我能快乐，但现在这还不够好。"当他们在外面时，"回到那里我本可以快乐，但现在还不够好。"我再让你们笑一些。

## 内在的挑剔机器 / The Internal Flawomatic

There's some people who think that New Yorkers have more of a problem with this than most anybody else. There's a theory. Anybody read the couple of weeks ago, New York Times Magazine, an article by John Tierney called Picky, Picky, Picky, do you see that?

He says that New Yorkers in particular have what he calls the internal flawomatic. Now, flawomatic is that, which focuses on the flaws, focuses on the faults, focuses on what's wrong, so we say, I hate this, this is not good enough. Now we use it on restaurants, we use it on art, we use it on our friends, we use it on our career, but he says, we go absolutely crazy when we use it on dates, when we use it on people, we're thinking about dating or we're sizing up as a prospective date or a mate or a companion.

And he puts it this way, he says, for example, he recounts one New Yorker talking to another New Yorker that he heard this, about a blind date that he had. He says, well, he says it's start out great, she opened the door, and she looked fantastic. Beautiful face, great body, nice smile, everything looked great, until she turned around, Chuck he said, she had dirty elbows.

And that was that, the guy went through with the rest of the date, but he knew the relationship possibilities were absolutely doomed. At first I thought, you know, there's some way maybe to work this out, some therapy, some soap and water, but then I realized it wouldn't matter, he'd find something else wrong. This is continuing to quote, it was like what I'd been hearing from my friends in New York for years and about why the latest relationships had gone wrong.

One said to me, well, she's really seemed intelligent, but then she mispronounced Gerta. And I knew she was faking it. Another said, there's no future for us, it's obvious to everybody that she should lose about seven pounds, but she doesn't seem to notice.

Everyone said, oh, sure, he's a partner, but it's not a very big firm, and besides that he wears these little short black socks that make his legs show when he crosses his legs. For years I knew my own requirements and a woman were absolutely reasonable, all I wanted was a nice novelist slash astronaut with a background in fashion modeling, but I couldn't see, I could see that all my other friends were much, much too picky, picky, picky. Now you laugh, my friends, a headache might be a symptom of just having no driven without your sunglasses, you know, or it might be a symptom of a brain tumor.

It might be something very light and passing or it might be something very deep. And the Bible says that yeah, maybe in New Yorkers, it's worse. In fact, Tierney actually says something, I think very, very powerful and right.

He says, why are we like this? Why are we worse than other places? Why do we do this to ourselves?

Why do we do this to people? Why this cosmic, phlegmatic? And he says maybe New York drives inhabitants crazy, maybe close encounters with wealth and glamour distort our vision.

But all he's saying is it's worse here. See, the Bible says this is not a symptom of driving without sunglasses. This is a symptom of a cancer that's eating away at your insides.

It's a cancer that's eating away totally at your insides. This is very powerful. He says our vision is distorted, says the author.

That's right. Look at this. They say our souls are dried up, okay?

They say our souls are dried up. We had it better in Egypt. Now look, you see the distortion?

They are so focused on the flaws. They are so focused on what's wrong. They're so focused on this.

They're completely distorted in their memory. How can they... We had it better in Egypt.

It was free. The food was free. Of course the food was free.

You were in chains. How could you overlook the slaughter of your children? But we had it better in Egypt.

How could they be so distorted? The writer is right. There's something in us.

There's a cosmic phlegmatic. It's going crazy here. We hate this stuff.

We hate our situation. It's not good enough. We had it better.

Let me show you just how powerful it is. The ultimate example of it. Is the Garden of Eden.

Here's Adam and Eve. They're there to show you yourself. Here's Adam and Eve.

And they're in paradise. And it's a perfect place. There's no death.

There's no disease. There's nothing wrong. Everything is perfect.

And yet through the serpent, the thought comes to them. Are you able to do anything you want? No, they say not anything.

We're not allowed to eat that tree. Anything else. We can do anything else.

We can eat anything else, but not that tree. And here comes the thought back. How bad it's the best one.

I'll bet it's better than all the other trees put together. And they were unsatisfied. And they felt I can think of a better situation than the Garden of Eden.

What do you think this means? Listen, I don't care on how unhappy you are right now with your circumstances. If you understand what the Bible is telling you, it is telling you that if you were to pick yourself up and put yourself down in the Garden of Eden with your heart in the same sinful condition as in now, you'd find something wrong with that.

That's what sin does. It makes you look for the fault. It makes you look for the flaw.

It makes you reject it. It makes you... Nothing is good enough.

Nothing is good enough. And so you're miserable. And you think about it like that.

So, this is the reason why some of us never get married or when you do get married, you're always unhappy with the one you're married to. This is the reason some of us are so driven in our career because we hate the wrong on the latter we're at. This is the reason some of you can't stand the way you look in the mirror.

This is the reason why many of us have such critical spirits toward other people. This is the reason why some of you can never join a church. Picky, picky, picky.

And of course you're going to find it. This is the reason why you're constantly having mid-life crises. And you're only in your early 20s.

Ah, because, you know, I just need a change. I don't like the way I am out there, back there. It's poisoning your life.

You can never sit down and enjoy what's in front of you. You can never sit back and just receive what you've got. To one degree and another, we're all suffering from it.

有些人认为纽约人在这方面比大多数其他人有更多的问题。有一个理论。有人读过几周前《纽约时报杂志》上约翰·蒂尔尼的一篇文章叫《挑剔、挑剔、挑剔》吗？你看到了吗？

他说纽约人特别有他所谓的"内在挑剔机器"。现在，挑剔机器就是那个专注于缺陷、专注于错误、专注于什么不对的东西，所以我们说，我讨厌这个，这还不够好。现在我们把它用在餐厅上，我们把它用在艺术上，我们把它用在我们的朋友上，我们把它用在我们的事业上，但他说，当我们把它用在约会上时，我们绝对疯了，当我们把它用在人身上时，我们正在考虑约会或我们正在评估作为潜在的约会对象或伴侣或同伴。

他这样说，例如，他讲述了一个纽约人和另一个纽约人交谈，他听到的关于他有过的一次相亲。他说，嗯，他说开始很好，她打开门，她看起来棒极了。美丽的脸，好身材，漂亮的笑容，一切看起来都很好，直到她转身，恰克，他说，她的肘部很脏。

就是这样，这个人完成了约会的其余部分，但他知道关系的可能性绝对完蛋了。起初我想，你知道，也许有某种方法可以解决这个问题，一些治疗，一些肥皂和水，但后来我意识到这无关紧要，他会找到其他错误。这继续引用，这就像我多年来从纽约的朋友那里听到的关于为什么最近的关系出问题的原因。

一个人对我说，嗯，她真的看起来很聪明，但后来她把歌德（Goethe）的发音说错了。我知道她在装的。另一个说，我们没有未来，每个人都很明显她应该减掉大约7磅，但她似乎没有注意到。

每个人都说，哦，当然，他是合伙人，但不是一家很大的公司，而且他穿那些小黑短袜，当他翘腿时露出他的腿。多年来我知道我对女性的要求绝对合理，我想要的只是一个有时尚模特背景的小说家兼宇航员，但我能看到，我能看到我所有其他朋友都太挑剔、挑剔、挑剔了。现在你笑了，我的朋友们，头痛可能是没戴太阳镜开车的症状，你知道，或者它可能是脑瘤的症状。

它可能是非常轻微和短暂的，或者它可能是非常深刻的。圣经说，是的，也许在纽约人身上，情况更糟。事实上，蒂尔尼实际上说了一些我认为非常、非常有力和正确的话。

他说，我们为什么这样？我们为什么比其他地方更糟？我们为什么对自己这样做？

我们为什么对人这样做？为什么这个宇宙性的挑剔机器？他说，也许纽约让居民发疯，也许与财富和魅力的近距离接触扭曲了我们的视野。

但他所说的只是这里更糟。看，圣经说这不是没戴太阳镜开车的症状。这是一种癌症的症状，它正在吞噬你的内脏。

这是一种完全吞噬你内脏的癌症。这非常有力。他说我们的视野被扭曲了，作者说。

没错。看这里。他们说我们的灵魂枯竭了，好吗？

他们说我们的灵魂枯竭了。我们在埃及时更好。现在看，你看到扭曲了吗？

他们如此专注于缺陷。他们如此专注于什么不对。他们如此专注于这个。

他们的记忆完全扭曲了。他们怎么能...我们在埃及时更好。

是免费的。食物是免费的。当然食物是免费的。

你们在枷锁中。你们怎么能忽略孩子们的屠杀？但我们在埃及时更好。

他们怎么能如此扭曲？作者是对的。我们里面有某种东西。

有一个宇宙性的挑剔机器。它在这里疯狂运作。我们讨厌这东西。

我们讨厌我们的处境。还不够好。我们过去更好。

让我向你们展示它有多强大。它的终极例子。是伊甸园。

这是亚当和夏娃。他们在那里向你展示你自己。这是亚当和夏娃。

他们在天堂。这是一个完美的地方。没有死亡。

没有疾病。什么都没问题。一切都是完美的。

然而通过蛇，这个想法来到他们那里。你能做任何你想做的事吗？不，他们说不是任何事。

我们不被允许吃那棵树。任何其他事。我们可以做任何其他事。

我们可以吃任何其他东西，但不是那棵树。然后这个想法回来了。多糟糕啊，那是最好的一个。

我敢打赌它比所有其他树加起来都好。他们不满意了。他们觉得我能想到比伊甸园更好的处境。

你认为这意味着什么？听着，我不在乎你现在对你的处境有多不快乐。如果你理解圣经告诉你的是什么，它告诉你如果你把自己捡起来放在伊甸园里，你的心在同样的罪恶状态下像现在一样，你会找到它的问题。

这就是罪所做的。它让你寻找错误。它让你寻找缺陷。

它让你拒绝它。它让你...没有什么是足够好的。

没有什么是足够好的。所以你很痛苦。你那样想它。

所以，这就是为什么我们中的一些人从不结婚，或者当你结婚时，你总是对你结婚的人不满。这就是为什么我们中的一些人在事业上如此被驱动，因为我们讨厌我们在梯子上的错误阶梯。这就是为什么你们中的一些人无法忍受你在镜子里看到的样子。

这就是为什么我们中的许多人对其他人有如此挑剔的精神。这就是为什么你们中的一些人永远无法加入一个教会。挑剔、挑剔、挑剔。

当然你会找到它。这就是为什么你不断经历中年危机。而你只是二十出头。

啊，因为，你知道，我只是需要改变。我不喜欢我现在的样子，在外面，在过去。它毒害了你的生活。

你永远无法坐下来享受眼前的东西。你永远无法坐下来只是接受你所拥有的。在某种程度或另一种程度上，我们都在遭受它。

## 根源：不信任神 / The Root: Not Trusting God

That's the symptom. Well, you say, well, what's the root of it? I can sort of see why this is kind of making my life a gray thing, a gray situation.

This kind of unhappy, always kind of gray and irritated and itchy and irritable and unhappy and critical of everybody and everything around. What's the root of it? Well, the root of it is the particular poison, but here's what the particular poison is.

You don't trust God further than you can throw him. You can't throw God even an inch. At the heart of why we are continually unhappy with everything and why we can never enjoy anything and why we're always miserable to one degree and other and never able to...

I mean, things are great at first, but then they wear, huh? They don't wear out. You say, I want something new.

I want something better. I want something... The reason for it, the Bible says, is the ultimate poison is you don't trust God.

You don't trust Him. You don't see His trust worthy. And if anybody here says that's not true of me, you don't know your own heart.

There's not a lot of things that I'm sure of. I only choose the things that I'm absolutely sure of. I can only get about 30 minutes worth a week together for you.

And I try to stick with those things that I'm ready to die for and the things that I'm absolutely sure of. And here's one I'm absolutely sure of. Your heart, my heart, doesn't trust God at all.

And if you don't know that, if you don't see that, and if you don't realize that this is the root of so many of your problems that you don't trust Him to be out for your best, you don't know your heart. Everywhere we look, we see brokenness, wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives.

How did it get this way, and what can be done about it? In His brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer, drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer.

Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin explains the pain we see all around us. And how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing.

Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world, struggling with your own mistakes or choices, or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us. This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Look at what they say, they say, our souls are dried up, why? Because we see nothing but this man up now. See what he's saying?

This is what they're saying. Because we have nothing but what God has given us, we're drying up. If we take only what God's given us, we're going to dry up.

If we rely only on what God has done, if we rely wholly on him, if we center wholly on him, we're going to die. It won't be enough. Now, by the way, this is an absolute lie.

In Deuteronomy 8, when their wilderness wanderings are done, God comes to them and He actually says, during the time you were in the wilderness, your feet did not swell. Now, you know, if you don't know this number's 11 passage and you don't know a little bit about biology and anatomy and physiology, you won't know what in the world's going on. Your feet swell up when you don't have a proper nutrient scurvy, for example, made your feet swell.

You didn't have enough vitamin C. What God is doing is He's coming back in Deuteronomy 8 and He's saying, in spite of what you have said, the manna was enough. You didn't think it was enough, but it was.

I fed you on, manna. It had every nutrient you needed, it had all the vitamins you needed, it had everything you needed. But, well, then what are they saying here?

They're saying, but we feel faint. We feel like we're drawing up, but it's not that hard to see. If two or three people get together and say, hey, let's tell them so and so that she looks terrible.

And if you do that over and over again, you know, call them up, talk to her, after while she starts to feel sick, of course she will. And that's funny, but this is not funny. This is exactly what we do with sin.

We look at our lives because this is what they did. They decided the manna wasn't enough, and therefore they felt sick. This isn't enough.

I'm feeling faint. I'm feeling nauseated. This man isn't enough.

And of course, they talked themselves into it. They really were sick. They really did feel that way.

That's exactly what we do in sin. You look around your life and say, there's not enough beauty here. There's not enough success here.

There's not enough love here. And if you tell yourself that, you'll start to feel faint and you will feel sick and you will start to pass out. You talk yourself into it.

And you know why? Underneath it all, we say, God, if I just trust God, I will dry up. Now somebody says, I don't believe that.

Let me show you how basic this is to all of our problems. Let me give you a very religious person and a very irreligious person, just for a second. A very, very irreligious person in New York City, for example, will say, what?

Obey the Tank Commandments, go to church, get down on my knees and confess on the center, pray, give my money away, no sex outside of merit, hey, religion, I want to enjoy life. What is that? If I obey God wholly and completely without fudging, without cutting any corners, I'll dry up.

They believe that. That's an assault, they laugh and they say it's an assault on the goodness of God. It is.

And there's many of you who are saying the same thing. I know what the Bible says, but I got to cut this corner. I know the Bible says I shouldn't do this, but I have to.

I know the Bible says I shouldn't, but I know the Bible says I shouldn't. I know what religion says, I know what Christianity says, but I really can't. I've got to supplement myself if I only do nothing but what God says, I'll dry up.

Nothing but this manna, won't be enough. On the other hand, let me show you a religious person. The typical religious person is somebody who's always feeling kind of guilty, always feeling kind of anxious.

Say something, you know, you say, you can be received by God not on the basis of anything you do, not on the basis of your good works, but surely and strictly and completely because Jesus died for you and loves you. And if you trust in Him instead of your own good works for your salvation, He'll receive you. You know what they say?

You know what? Really, moralistic religious people say, that's too easy. They always say that, in fact, some of you are saying that, that's too easy, I don't believe that.

You've got to be good. I've got to add something of my own. Nothing but isn't enough, I'll dry up.

Don't you realize the person who doesn't believe God really forgives or the person who thinks obedience is just going to make my life, you know, it's going to hold me and I'm not going to be able to enjoy life if I'm totally obedient. Your life is poisoned by this. You don't trust God.

And because you don't trust God, do you see how it works? Because you don't trust God. The things that you turn to cannot fulfill you the way God did, the way God was supposed to.

You know, when David put on Saul's armor, it wasn't built for him. Remember that? Little David, before he went off to Goliath, Saul says, put on my armor, that'll protect you.

He put on his armor and the armor didn't fit him. You know, it chafed on him and it dragged him down and it impeded him. When you turn to things besides God, you don't trust God, nothing but the man.

You don't trust God to fulfill you say, I'm going to have to do this. I want this as well. I want this as well.

I want this as well. I want this as well. Those things will not fulfill you.

They will not satisfy you and you will find fault with them. You have to. They'll never satisfy, they'll never please.

And everything around you because you don't trust him. You will find fault with. You'll be picky, picky, picky.

这就是症状。嗯，你说，嗯，它的根源是什么？我可以看到为什么这让我的生活变成一种灰色的东西，一种灰色的处境。

这种不快乐，总是灰色的，烦躁的，发痒的，易怒的，不快乐的，对周围的每个人和每件事都很挑剔。它的根源是什么？嗯，它的根源是特定的毒素，但这是特定的毒素。

你对神的信任还不如你能扔动他。你甚至不能把神扔一英寸。我们为什么不断对一切都不满意、为什么我们永远无法享受任何东西、为什么我们总是在某种程度上痛苦、永远无法...

我的意思是，一开始事情很好，但然后它们磨损，嗯？它们没有磨损。你说，我想要新的东西。

我想要更好的东西。我想要...圣经说，原因是终极的毒素是你不信任神。

你不信任他。你看不到他的可信赖。如果这里有人说这对我不是真的，你不了解你自己的心。

我不能确定很多事情。我只选择我绝对确定的事情。我每周只能为你们集合大约30分钟的内容。

我试图坚持那些我准备为之而死的事情和我绝对确定的事情。这是我绝对确定的一件事。你的心，我的心，根本不信任神。

如果你不知道这一点，如果你看不到这一点，如果你没有意识到这是你如此多问题的根源——你不信任他会为你的最大利益着想，你就不了解你的心。我们到处看，都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中都感受到它。

它是如何变成这样的，对此能做些什么？在他本月发布的全新书中《世界出了什么问题？》提摩太·凯勒提供了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案，源自在救赎主教会讲授的一系列教导。

凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦。以及只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。

无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择作斗争，或者在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题》将帮助你看到福音如何既对我们世界的心痛也对我们每个人内心的痛苦说话。这本新发布的书《世界出了什么问题》是我们对你本月帮助福音与生命分享耶稣好消息的礼物的感谢。今天在gospelandlife.com/give请求你的副本。

那是gospelandlife.com/give。现在是凯勒博士讲授今天教导的其余部分。

看他们说什么，他们说，我们的灵魂枯竭了，为什么？因为我们除了这吗哪什么也看不见。看他在说什么？

这就是他们在说的。因为我们除了神给我们的什么都没有，我们正在枯竭。如果我们只拿神给我们的，我们就会枯竭。

如果我们只依靠神所做的，如果我们完全依靠他，如果我们完全以他为中心，我们就会死。这还不够。现在，顺便说一下，这是一个绝对的谎言。

在申命记第8章，当他们的旷野漂流结束时，神来到他们那里，他实际上说，在你们在旷野的时候，你们的脚没有肿。现在，你知道，如果你不知道民数记第11章的这段经文，你不知道一点生物学、解剖学和生理学，你不会知道到底发生了什么。当你没有适当的营养时，你的脚会肿起来，例如坏血病，使你的脚肿。

你没有足够的维生素C。神正在做的是他回到申命记第8章，他说，尽管你们说了什么，吗哪是足够的。你们不认为它足够，但它是。

我用吗哪喂养你们。它有你们需要的每一种营养，它有你们需要的所有维生素，它有你们需要的一切。但，嗯，那他们在这里说什么呢？

他们说，但我们感到虚弱。我们感觉我们正在枯竭，但这并不难看到。如果两三个人聚在一起说，嘿，让我们告诉某某她看起来很糟糕。

如果你一遍又一遍地这样做，你知道，打电话给他们，和她说话，过一段时间她开始感到生病，当然她会。这很有趣，但这不有趣。这正是我们对罪所做的。

我们看着我们的生活，因为这就是他们所做的。他们决定吗哪不够，因此他们感到生病。这还不够。

我感到虚弱。我感到恶心。这吗哪不够。

当然，他们说服自己相信了。他们真的生病了。他们真的有那种感觉。

这正是我们在罪中所做的。你环顾你的生活说，这里没有足够的美。这里没有足够的成功。

这里没有足够的爱。如果你这样告诉自己，你会开始感到虚弱，你会感到生病，你会开始昏倒。你说服自己相信它。

你知道为什么？在这一切之下，我们说，神啊，如果我只是信任神，我会枯竭。现在有人说，我不相信这个。

让我向你展示这对我们所有问题有多基本。让我给你一个非常有宗教信仰的人和一个非常没有宗教信仰的人，就一秒钟。例如，纽约市一个非常、非常没有宗教信仰的人会说什么？

遵守十诫，去教堂，跪下来承认罪，祷告，把我的钱给出去，婚姻之外没有性，嘿，宗教，我想享受生活。那是什么？如果我完全彻底地顺服神，不打折扣，不走捷径，我会枯竭。

他们相信这个。这是攻击，他们笑着说这是对神的良善的攻击。确实是。

你们中有许多人在说同样的话。我知道圣经说什么，但我必须走这条捷径。我知道圣经说我不应该这样做，但我必须这样做。

我知道圣经说我不应该，但我知道圣经说我不应该。我知道宗教说什么，我知道基督教说什么，但我真的不能。如果我只做神说的，我必须补充自己，我会枯竭。

只有这吗哪，还不够。另一方面，让我向你展示一个有宗教信仰的人。典型的有宗教信仰的人是总是感到有点内疚、总是感到有点焦虑的人。

说一些话，你知道，你说，你可以被神接纳不是基于你所做的任何事，不是基于你的好行为，而是确实地、严格地、完全地因为耶稣为你死了并爱你。如果你信靠他而不是你自己的好行为来得救，他会接纳你。你知道他们说什么吗？

你知道吗？真的，道德主义的有宗教信仰的人说，那太容易了。他们总是这样说，事实上，你们中的一些人正在这样说，那太容易了，我不相信。

你必须行善。我必须添加一些我自己的东西。只有还不够，我会枯竭。

你没有意识到那个不相信神真的宽恕的人或那个认为顺服只是会让我的生活，你知道，它会束缚我，如果我完全顺服，我就无法享受生活的人。你的生活被这个毒害了。你不信任神。

因为你不信任神，你看到它是如何运作的吗？因为你不信任神。你转向的东西不能像神那样满足你，不能像神应该的那样满足你。

你知道，当大卫穿上扫罗的盔甲时，它不是为他建造的。记得那个吗？小大卫，在他去歌利亚之前，扫罗说，穿上我的盔甲，那会保护你。

他穿上他的盔甲，盔甲不适合他。你知道，它磨他，拖累他，妨碍他。当你转向神以外的东西时，你不信任神，只有吗哪。

你不信任神来满足你说，我必须这样做。我也想要这个。我也想要这个。

我也想要这个。我也想要这个。那些东西不会满足你。

它们不会使你满意，你会挑它们的毛病。你必须这样。它们永远不会满足，它们永远不会取悦。

你周围的一切，因为你不信任他。你会挑毛病。你会挑剔、挑剔、挑剔。

## 解药：天上的真粮 / The Antidote: The True Bread of Heaven

Your flammatic will be going off all the time. Now what's the antidote? Well, here's the antidote.

What was their antidote? What they should have done if they had not despised the manor. If they had said, look at this great thing that God's given us.

Instead of saying, we wish we had fish, we wish we had leeks and onions and melons and garlic. Instead of they said, what a miracle this is. If they had focused, yeah, it's only one thing.

There's nothing wrong with saying, Lord, how about two kinds of manor? How about light meat and dark meat or something, light and dark manor, how about something else? Yeah, all right.

Manor, it's one thing, all right. But instead of focusing on that, the fact it was the same. Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was there?

Why didn't they focus on the fact that it was mercy? Why didn't they focus on the fact it was a miracle? Why didn't they focus on the mercy and goodness of God?

And if they had stopped despising with the spirit of Thanksgiving, the manor, then they would not have been talking themselves into their misery. Now what's the lesson here? The lesson is, if you are finding fault with everything, if you're looking out there and everything is bad or wrong, the Bible tells you it's because you have despised the true manor of heaven in some way.

The only reason we're unhappy with everything is because we've despised the true manor. Well, what's the true manor? Well Jesus had a conversation in John 6 and in John 6, they get together and they said to him, you know what, how do we know you're from God?

Our forefathers, they knew that God was with them because God sent the manor. How do we know God's with you? And Jesus says, you know the manor that Moses gave you?

That was good stuff, but it was just a symbol of the bread from heaven I can give you. And he says, do you know why your souls are so empty? Do you know why you can't feel happy about anything?

Do you know why nothing satisfies you? It's because you don't have this bread from heaven. It's because you don't have eternal life, a kind of joy and a kind of power and a kind of love that fulfills you.

If you eat this bread from heaven, the bread I give you, you will never hunger again. You know what they say? They said, sir, give us this bread.

If this is the reason why we can't find happiness anywhere, if this is the reason why nothing's good enough, give it to us and what did he say? I am the bread of life. I am the bread that comes down from heaven.

And you know what they immediately did? They despised him. They despised him.

You know what they said? They said, you aren't you the son of Joseph, aren't you the carpenter? Give me a break.

You can read that in John chapter 641. They despised him just like they despised this manor. And that's exactly the way Jesus Christ and the gospel itself has always been treated.

In New York City, if you bring this up, if you just say to the average person that you work with or that you study with or something, you say, I believe Jesus is the son of God. It came down from heaven to save us from our sins, that his blood is atone for our sins. And now if we receive him, we can be born again.

And what do they say? They don't say, well, this is a very interesting theory. Let's talk about it.

Oh no. They despise it. This manor.

They have contempt. You say they look down at it. You know, when Paul preached it, Paul, the great mind, he preached on, you know, at the area of apagus on Athens Hill.

What do they say to him? They say, oh, this is very interesting. They said, what does this babbler have to say?

And you know, when Jesus Christ himself moved through his life, they continually despised him. They treated him like the manor. They said, can anything good come out of Nazareth?

Nothing good comes out of Nazareth, right? And when he was crucified, he was mocked. They said, you say you're a king.

We'll treat you as a king. Here's a crown of thorns. And as they stood there bleeding, they said, hail king of the Jews.

You say you're a prophet? See? We'll see if you're a prophet.

They blindfold and they start beating him and they said, if you're a prophet, prophesy, who just hit you? Contempt. They despised him.

Isaiah 53 says, he was despised and rejected and we esteemed and not. But this is how he saved us. Because as we despised him, he refused to despise us.

As a matter of fact, this is the polar opposite to the flammatics in our heart. He didn't just refuse to despise us. He did the opposite.

You know what we do? We look past the good to hate things. He looked past our evil to love us.

There's this place in the movie, guarding tests. Any of you see that? Shirley McLean plays the widow of a president.

And she's guarded by a secret service agent and she insists on this one secret service agent, Nicholas Cage. And you know why? She knew what most people didn't know that her husband was unfaithful to her.

Her husband, the president, had been really quite a cad. And therefore, when he died in office, people wept but they didn't know him. They didn't know him.

But she knew that Nicholas Cage, the secret service agent, knew what kind of man he was, knew about all his flaws, knew what a coward in many ways he was, knew what a cad he was, but she saw him cry at the funeral. And she said, here's somebody who knew him, but still loved him. And that's why she insisted that he always stay by her side, because she also knew him, but still loved him.

That's the opposite of envy. And that's what Jesus Christ does. He knows you, says in John chapter 2, he knew it was in us and he didn't trust us.

He knows our sinful heart so much that he doesn't even trust us, but he's the opposite. He goes by the good to hate and focus on the flaws. He goes by the evil and he loves us anyway.

He refused to despise us, despisers. Now friends, do you understand that? I'll just close with two things.

First of all, some of you don't really maybe understand even the gospel. Here's the gospels right here. Jesus Christ is the bread of heaven.

Bread cannot make you whole unless it's broken. If you have looked at Jesus Christ as a kind of model or an example over the years that you emulate, he's a failure as a model. Do you know that?

You know why he's a failure? If you think to be a Christian is just to emulate him and just to try to be like him, he's a failure as a model. Because all he'll do is make you feel terrible.

You'll never live up to it. But if you see him as broken bread, if you break the bread, then you can be whole. If the bread stays whole, you starve.

If the bread is broken, you can be whole. If the bread is whole, you will stay broken. Jesus Christ says, I'm the bread of life.

I give my flesh for the life of the world until you see him as having been despised for you, paying for the fact that you're a despiser, paying for your sin. Until you see him as that, you'll never receive this new life. You'll never receive his love.

You'll never receive his joy. It'll never come into you and turn you into a whole different kind of person. One that knows how to look by the evil and a firm.

But now, Christian friends, all I can say to you is, you may say, I know this, why is my flawed manner going crazy still? And I'll tell you why is going crazy still? Because you're not remembering these things.

Friends, look at Jesus. Instead of focusing on the sins around people, you ought to be looking past it. You ought to be the easiest people in the world to be a failure in front of.

Are you the kind of person like Jesus who says the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak? I know you mean well. Or remember the woman caught in adultery?

What did he say? Neither do I condemn thee, but go and sin no more. Or are you the kind of person that, when somebody, you find something wrong with someone you're saying, I found you.

There it is. Are you an easy person to fail in front of? Are you an affirming person?

Are you a person who knows how to cover up people's nakedness? I don't mean not deal with it. I mean love them in spite of it.

If you can't, if you're not patient, if you're not able to enjoy with gratitude, what God has given you. If you're not able to sit down and enjoy it and live a life of gratitude, unless you're able to discipline yourself to look at all of life in gratitude, you've forgotten what he's done for you. You don't like the person that you're having to be thrown together with right now?

He say, ah, they give me the creeps. You gave Jesus the creeps. And he looked right past the creeps.

And he loved you. He refused to despise you. How can you despise them?

Are you unhappy with your situation right now? The fault, dear Brutus, is not in your stars. It's in yourselves.

You ought to look at your problems right now and say, look, there are things that I should change and I will change, but I'm not going to be miserable today. You know why? Because if I was in the Garden of Eden today, with my heart operating, the way my heart is operating, it would not be enough.

But Jesus is good enough. And he died for me to make me good enough even for the Father. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you'd help us to overcome the envy, that you'd help us to overcome it. And it was to overcome the fault-finding, the misery that is to great degree self-imposed, help us not to despise your son and the gospel, but help us to see that he refused to despise those who despised him so that we might become affirming people, people who live lives of affirmation and gratitude. Make us so we ask it in Jesus' name, amen.

你的挑剔机器会一直运作。现在解药是什么？嗯，这是解药。

如果他们没有藐视吗哪，他们的解药应该是什么。如果他们说，看看神给我们的这个伟大的东西。

而不是说，我们希望我们有鱼，我们希望我们有韭菜、洋葱、西瓜和大蒜。相反，他们说，这是多么大的神迹。如果他们专注，是的，只有一样东西。

说"主啊，来两种吗哪怎么样？来点淡肉和深色肉或什么的，淡色和深色吗哪，来点别的怎么样？"没什么问题。是的，好的。

吗哪，一样东西，好的。但是，他们为什么不专注于它就在那里的事实，而是专注于它是一样的事实？

他们为什么不专注于它在那里的事实？他们为什么不专注于它是怜悯的事实？他们为什么不专注于它是神迹的事实？他们为什么不专注于神的怜悯和良善？

如果他们以感恩的精神停止藐视吗哪，那么他们就不会把自己说进他们的痛苦中。现在教训是什么？教训是，如果你在挑剔一切的毛病，如果你看外面一切都是坏的或错的，圣经告诉你这是因为你以某种方式藐视了天上的真吗哪。

我们对一切都不满意的唯一原因是因为我们藐视了真吗哪。嗯，什么是真吗哪？嗯，耶稣在约翰福音第6章有一个对话，在约翰福音第6章，他们聚在一起，他们对他说，你知道吗，我们怎么知道你来自神？

我们的祖先，他们知道神与他们同在，因为神降下了吗哪。我们怎么知道神与你同在？耶稣说，你知道摩西给你们的吗哪吗？

那是好东西，但它只是我能给你们的从天上来的粮的象征。他说，你知道为什么你们的灵魂如此空虚吗？你知道为什么你们无法对任何事情感到快乐吗？

你知道为什么没有什么能满足你们吗？因为你们没有这从天上来的粮。因为你们没有永生，一种满足你们的喜乐、能力和爱。

如果你们吃这从天上来的粮，我给你们的粮，你们就永远不会再饿。你知道他们说什么吗？他们说，先生，把这粮给我们。

如果这是我们无法在任何地方找到快乐的原因，如果这是没有什么足够好的原因，把它给我们，他说了什么？我就是生命的粮。我就是从天上降下来的粮。

你知道他们立即做了什么吗？他们藐视他。他们藐视他。

你知道他们说什么吗？他们说，你不是约瑟的儿子吗，你不是木匠吗？饶了我吧。

你可以在约翰福音第6章第41节读到。他们藐视他，就像他们藐视这吗哪一样。这正是耶稣基督和福音本身一直被对待的方式。

在纽约市，如果你提起这个，如果你只是对你一起工作或一起学习的普通人说，你说，我相信耶稣是神的儿子。从天上降下来拯救我们脱离罪，他的血为我们的罪赎罪。现在如果我们接受他，我们就能重生。

他们说什么？他们不说，嗯，这是一个非常有趣的理论。让我们谈谈它。

哦不。他们藐视它。这吗哪。

他们有蔑视。你说他们看不起它。你知道，当保罗传讲它时，保罗，这个伟大的头脑，他在雅典山的亚略巴古传讲。

他们对他说什么？他们说，哦，这很有趣。他们说，这个胡言乱语的人要说什么？

你知道，当耶稣基督自己经历他的生活时，他们不断藐视他。他们像对待吗哪一样对待他。他们说，拿撒勒能出什么好的吗？

拿撒勒出不了什么好东西，对吧？当他被钉十字架时，他被嘲笑。他们说，你说你是国王。

我们会把你当作国王对待。这是荆棘冠冕。当他们站在那里流血时，他们说，恭喜，犹太人的王。

你说你是先知？看？我们会看看你是不是先知。

他们蒙住他的眼睛，开始打他，他们说，如果你是先知，预言，谁刚打了你？蔑视。他们藐视他。

以赛亚书第53章说，他被藐视，被人厌弃，我们也不尊重他。但这就是他如何拯救我们的。因为当我们藐视他时，他拒绝藐视我们。

事实上，这与我们心中的挑剔机器完全相反。他不仅拒绝藐视我们。他做了相反的事。

你知道我们做什么吗？我们越过好的去恨东西。他越过我们的恶去爱我们。

电影《保卫特斯》中有这样一个地方。你们有人看过吗？雪莉·麦克莱恩扮演一位总统的遗孀。

她由一名特勤局特工保护，她坚持要这位特勤局特工，尼古拉斯·凯奇。你知道为什么吗？她知道大多数人不知道的事——她的丈夫对她不忠。

她的丈夫，总统，真的是个花花公子。因此，当他在任期内去世时，人们哭泣，但他们不了解他。他们不了解他。

但她知道尼古拉斯·凯奇，那个特勤局特工，知道他是什么样的人，知道他所有的缺陷，知道他在许多方面是多么懦弱，知道他是个花花公子，但她看到他在葬礼上哭泣。她说，这是一个了解他但仍然爱他的人。这就是为什么她坚持让他一直留在她身边，因为她也了解他，但仍然爱他。

这与嫉妒相反。这就是耶稣基督所做的。他知道你，约翰福音第2章说，他知道我们里面是什么，他不信任我们。

他太了解我们罪恶的心，以至于他甚至不信任我们，但他是相反的。他越过好的去恨和专注于缺陷。他越过恶，他无论如何都爱我们。

他拒绝藐视我们这些藐视者。现在朋友们，你们明白吗？我只用两件事来结束。

首先，你们中的一些人可能甚至不真正理解福音。福音就在这里。耶稣基督是天上的粮。

粮不能使你完全，除非它被擘开。如果你多年来一直把耶稣基督看作是一种模式或榜样来效仿，他作为模式是失败的。你知道吗？

你知道为什么他失败吗？如果你认为成为基督徒只是效仿他，只是试图像他一样，他作为模式是失败的。因为他所做的只会让你感觉糟糕。

你永远无法达到它。但如果你看到他是擘开的饼，如果你擘饼，那么你就能完全。如果饼保持完整，你会饿死。

如果饼被擘开，你就能完全。如果饼是完整的，你将保持破碎。耶稣基督说，我是生命的粮。

我为世界的生命舍了我的肉，直到你看到他为你被藐视，为你是藐视者的事实付代价，为你的罪付代价。直到你看到他是那样，你永远不会得到这新生命。你永远不会得到他的爱。

你永远不会得到他的喜乐。它永远不会进入你，把你变成一个完全不同的人。一个知道如何越过恶去肯定的人。

但现在，基督徒朋友们，我只能对你们说，你们可能说，我知道这个，为什么我的挑剔机器还在疯狂运作？我告诉你为什么还在疯狂运作？因为你没有记住这些事情。

朋友们，看耶稣。你应该越过人们周围的罪来看，而不是专注于它们。你应该成为世界上最容易在其面前失败的人。

你是像耶稣那样说"心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱"的那种人吗？我知道你是好意的。还是记得那个行淫时被抓的妇人？

他说了什么？我也不定你的罪，去吧，不要再犯罪了。还是你是那种当你发现某人有什么不对时，你说，我抓住你了。

就是这样。你是一个容易在其面前失败的人吗？你是一个肯定人的人吗？

你是一个知道如何遮盖人的赤身的人吗？我不是说不处理它。我是说尽管如此还爱他们。

如果你不能，如果你不耐心，如果你不能以感恩的心享受神给你的东西。如果你不能坐下来享受它，过一种感恩的生活，除非你能训练自己以感恩的眼光看待所有生活，你已经忘记了他为你做了什么。你不喜欢现在必须和你在一起的人？

他说，啊，他们让我毛骨悚然。你让耶稣毛骨悚然。他越过这毛骨悚然的感觉。

他爱你。他拒绝藐视你。你怎么能藐视他们？

你对你现在的处境不满意吗？亲爱的布鲁图斯，错不在你的星宿。而在你们自己。

你应该看看你现在的问题说，看，有些事情我应该改变，我会改变，但我今天不会痛苦。你知道为什么吗？因为如果我今天在伊甸园，以我的心运作的方式，我的心正在运作的方式，这还不够。

但耶稣是足够好的。他为我而死，使我甚至对父来说也足够好。让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们求你帮助我们克服嫉妒，帮助我们克服它。帮助我们克服挑剔、克服那在很大程度上是自我强加的痛苦，帮助我们不要藐视你的儿子和福音，而是帮助我们看到他拒绝藐视那些藐视他的人，以便我们可能成为肯定的人，过着肯定和感恩的生活的人。使我们这样，我们奉耶稣的名求，阿们。
