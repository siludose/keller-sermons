## 施洗约翰的自我认知

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Today, Tim Keller is looking at a passage from the opening chapter of the Gospel of John. John begins his account of Christ's birth not with shepherds or angels, but with the mystery of the Word becoming flesh, God Himself entering the world as a person in Jesus Christ. Join us as Tim Keller explores the meaning of Jesus' birth. Tonight's scripture reading is from John chapter 1, verses 19 to 28.

Now this was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, I am not the Messiah. They asked him, then who are you?

Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet?

He answered, no. Finally, they said, Who are you?

Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?

John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness. Make straight the way for the Lord. Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?

I baptize with water, John replied, but among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. The word of the Lord.

Now during these weeks leading up to Christmas, we've been looking at John chapter 1, because John chapter 1 tells us in there, the gospel writer John is telling us about the meaning of Jesus coming into the world, which of course is the meaning of Christmas. But here right in the middle of John chapter 1 is this passage in which the religious leaders come out and they send people out to interrogate John the Baptist. Who are you?

Who do you think you are? And it doesn't look like it's got much to do with Christmas and maybe not real direction. But it does look like it's got much to do with Christmas and maybe not real direction.

And yet it does. And here's the reason why. We begin to see in John the Baptist some very deep changes in him, in his inner life, even though he knows that the Messiah is coming, as he testifies here. Yet he doesn't know anything. He doesn't know much at all compared to what we know about who Jesus is and why he came.

And yet, even though he knows a lot less than you and I know, I want to show you, some kind of major change has happened to him. Some kind of inner change has happened to him. And if he's had that change with what little knowledge he had of the meaning of Christmas, how much more should we be exhibiting that change?

So let's start here by looking at, put it this way, John's self-image. Because this whole passage is about something, about that. Verse 19. This was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.

那么让我们从这里开始，看看约翰的自我形象。因为整段经文讲的就是这件事。第19节：

> "约翰所作的见证记在下面：犹太人从耶路撒冷差祭司和利未人到约翰那里，问他说：'你是谁？'"
> ——约翰福音 1:19

所以，这一切都是关于——施洗约翰是谁？他的自我形象是什么？他的身份是什么？他对自己的身份有什么样的认识？

让我们来看看约翰对自己的看法、约翰对耶稣的看法、由此产生的品格转变，以及我们如何也能经历这种转变。

好的，首先，约翰对自己的看法。施洗约翰是当时全国最重要的宗教人物，但他并不是通过正规渠道上来的。他没有经过什么官方认可的宗教机构之类的途径。

你们知道，当守门人看到有人在他们的领域里变得声名显赫，却没有经过他们的门，他们就会非常不安，因为他们知道自己已经失去了控制。所以守门人派了一些人出去说：你到底是谁？你以为你是谁？你的身份是什么？

他们至少问了他三个问题。你是弥赛亚吗？你是以利亚吗？你是那先知吗？

"你是弥赛亚吗，约翰？"他说："不是。""你是以利亚吗？"

这是什么意思呢？在希伯来圣经玛拉基书第四章中，有一个预言说，在弥赛亚来到之前，会有一位先驱者。在弥赛亚到来之前，会有一个人像以利亚一样。"像以利亚"的意思大概是：穿着粗糙的衣服，呼召人们悔改，诸如此类。

所以在弥赛亚来临之前，会有一位先驱者，一个像以利亚的人——他们就直接称他为以利亚。"你是那个人吗？"

他说："不是。"然后经文说："你是那先知吗？"

这实际上出自申命记第十八章。在申命记第十八章中，摩西说，将来有一位先知要兴起，他要带领我们的百姓。有些人认为那先知就是以利亚，有些人认为那先知就是弥赛亚。这些都不重要。因为基本上，他们问的是：你是弥赛亚吗？不是。你是以利亚——弥赛亚的先驱吗？

他说：不是。那么，约翰说对了吗？

不，他没有说对。他对自己的认识是错误的。他并不了解自己到底是谁。因为在马太福音中，有好几处记载人们问耶稣对施洗约翰的看法。当施洗约翰被斩首之后——是的，他被斩首了，我们稍后再回来说这件事——有人来见耶稣，问他："你对施洗约翰怎么看？"

## 耶稣论施洗约翰的伟大

So this is all about, who is John the Baptist? What is his self-image?

What is his identity? What does he understand his identity to be?

Let's take a look at John's view of himself, John's view of Jesus, the resulting character change, and how we might know it as well. Okay, first of all, John's view of Jesus. John the Baptist was the leading religious figure in the country, but he'd not come up through the channels. He didn't come up through accredited religious institutions or anything like that.

And so, you know, gatekeepers, when they see somebody getting very big in their field and didn't use their gates, they get pretty upset because they know that they've lost control. So the gatekeepers send some people out and say, come on, who are you?

Who do you think you are? What's your identity?

And they ask him at least these three questions. Are you the Messiah?

Are you Elijah? Are you the prophet?

Now, the Messiah, are you the Messiah, John? And he says, no. Are you Elijah?

Now, what's that about? Well, in Malachi chapter four in the Hebrew Bible, there's a prophecy that says before the Messiah comes, there'll be a forerunner. That before the Messiah gets here, there'll be someone like unto. Elijah. Probably like unto Elijah means he wears a rough, rough clothing, calls people to repentance, that kind of thing.

And so somebody before a Messiah comes, the forerunner, someone like Elijah, they call him just Elijah. Are you that?

He says, no. Then it says, are you the prophet?

That's actually from Deuteronomy 18. In Deuteronomy 18, Moses says, someday a prophet will arise and he'll lead our people. And some people thought the prophet was Elijah. Some people thought the prophet was the Messiah. It doesn't matter. Because basically, what he's being asked, are you the Messiah?

耶稣是这样说的。这记载在马太福音第十七章：

> "只是我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，人却不认识他，竟任意待他。"
> ——马太福音 17:12

这就是耶稣在说：约翰就是那要来的以利亚。他就是圣经所写到的那位，是先知所预言的那位。但更令人惊叹的是马太福音第十一章，耶稣对他的听众谈论施洗约翰时说的话：

> "你们出去究竟是为什么？是要看先知吗？我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。"
> ——马太福音 11:9

> "我实在告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的。"
> ——马太福音 11:11

> "你们若肯领受，这人就是那应当来的以利亚。"
> ——马太福音 11:14

首先，他再次说：他就是以利亚，他就是那个人。但接着他说了一句惊人的话。他说："凡妇人所生的"——顺便说一下，这不过是一种优美的修辞方式来表达"所有人"，好吗？我的意思是，我想，除非你不是由女人所生的，那请你之后来告诉我，因为你非常特别，你大概来自另一个星球。

然而，耶稣说了什么？他说："凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的。"这是耶稣基督在说：这是有史以来最伟大的人。

这是耶稣在说：施洗约翰是迄今为止所生的人中最伟大的。而且他就是以利亚。但当他们问约翰这些问题时，他说：不是，不是，不是，不是。

所以第一个要点是：约翰完全不知道自己的伟大。他看不到。他看不出自己有多伟大。而且他弄错了。

顺便说一下，当你看到一个人真的对自己的伟大毫无概念，似乎看不到自己多有才华、多伟大、是多么了不起的一个人——只有两种可能。一种是这个人太过自我沉溺，花太多时间审视自己，以至于每一个小瑕疵都被放大了。所以有些人就是这样，他们太专注于自己，总是看自己不好。

所以有些人看不到自己多伟大的一个原因是，他们总是在审视自己，总是在检视自己。另一种可能——这更为罕见——是他其实根本就不怎么看自己。他不是在评估自己。他没有在审视自己。你知道为什么吗？

因为他在注视另一个人。这就是约翰的方向，但让我们继续往下看。所以，约翰对自己的看法非常非常低——实际上是低得离谱了。那么其次，约翰对耶稣的看法是什么？

---

## 约翰对耶稣的极高认识

No. Are you Elijah, the forerunner of the Messiah?

He says, no. Was John right?

No, it wasn't. He got himself wrong. He did not understand who he was. Because in Matthew, in the gospel of Matthew, there's a couple of places where people ask Jesus what he thinks of John the Baptist. When John the Baptist, is beheaded, funk, he was beheaded. We'll get back to bit. Somebody came to Jesus after that and said, you know, what do you think of John the Baptist?

And this is what Jesus says. This is in Matthew 17. He says, Elijah has come and they have done to him whatever they wished, even as it was written of him.

So that's Jesus saying, John was the Elijah who was to come. He was the one that the Bible wrote about, that the Bible, the prophet spoke about. But even more amazing is in Matthew 11, when Jesus speaks to his listeners about John the Baptist, and this is what he says. He says, what did you go out into the wilderness to see when you went out to see John the Baptist?

Because that's where he preached in the wilderness. What did you go out in the wilderness to see?

A prophet, Jesus says. Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. Truly, I tell you, among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. If you're willing to accept it Elijah who was to come.

Now, first of all, again, he says, he's Elijah. He's the guy. But then he says an amazing thing. He says, among those born of women, which, by the way, is just a nice rhetorical way of saying everybody, okay?

I mean, I think, unless, if you have not been born of a woman, come tell me afterwards, because, you know, you're very special, and you're probably from another planet. However, what has Jesus said?

He says, if you're willing to accept it Elijah who was to come. He says, among all those born of women, there's never been one greater than John the Baptist. This is Jesus Christ saying, this is the greatest man who ever lived.

Here's Jesus saying, John the Baptist is the greatest person ever born, up to now. And he's Elijah. But when they asked him about that, he said, no, no, no, no, no.

So the first point here is that Elijah had no idea, pardon me, that John had no idea about his own greatness. He couldn't see it. He couldn't see how great he was. Uh, and he got it wrong.

Now, by the way, when you see somebody who really just does not have any real concept of how great he uh, doesn't seem to see how talented, how great, what a tremendous person he there's only two possibilities. The one is that person is so self-absorbed, is spending so much time examining him or herself all the time, that every little flaw looks big. So you got some people who are just, you know, they're just so, you know, you're so absorbed on themselves. They're just down on themselves.

---

那简直是高到令人眩晕。当他们开始问约翰关于那位将要来的是谁的时候，在第23节，约翰引用了以赛亚书第四十章，他说：

> "我就是那在旷野有人声喊着说：'修直主的道路'，正如先知以赛亚所说的。"
> ——约翰福音 1:23

当他说"我所做的一切就是为那位将要来的预备道路"时，约翰说以赛亚在以赛亚书第四十章中预言了他：

> "有人声喊着说：在旷野预备耶和华的路，在沙漠地修平我们神的道。"
> ——以赛亚书 40:3

如果你回到以赛亚书第四十章，你会看到以赛亚曾预言，有一天事情会变得极其糟糕，以至于上帝自己要亲自降临来拨乱反正。我们要在旷野为他修筑一条大道。所以基本上，这是以赛亚预言上帝自己要亲自降临。以赛亚在那里使用的词是"耶和华"将要来——"耶和华"是上帝的圣名，是上帝在燃烧的荆棘丛中启示给摩西的他的名字。

但约翰把这个预言应用在耶稣身上。你看到了吗？通过引用以赛亚书第四十章并将其应用在耶稣身上，约翰是在说：我所讲的那位将要来的，就是上帝自己。

然后他实际上做了一个修辞上的点睛之笔，真正把这一点推向了高潮。在接近末尾的地方，第26节，他说：

> "约翰回答说：'我是用水施洗，但有一位站在你们中间，是你们不认识的，就是那在我以后来的，我给他解鞋带也不配。'"
> ——约翰福音 1:26-27

你看第26到27节。这段话非常非常有戏剧性。约翰说：他已经在外面了。他还没有显明自己，但他就在我们中间。他此刻可能就站在那里。他实际上可能就在人群中。这非常有戏剧性。

约翰知道耶稣不是要在二十年、三十年或四十年后才来——他已经在这里了。然后他说："就是那在我以后来的，我给他解鞋带也不配。"

你知道，在每一种文化中，都有一些事情是如此卑贱、如此令人不齿，以至于没有人愿意做。在那个文化中，就是解鞋带。那是一个炎热、尘土飞扬的文化。人们来到一户人家中，唯一会脱掉那些又臭又脏又污秽的鞋子的人，只能是最低等中的最低等、最卑微的奴仆中最卑微的那一个。

有规定说，除非你是奴隶，否则没有人能被强迫做这件事。所以如果你有任何社会地位，没有人能强迫你去给别人解鞋带，除非你是最底层中的最底层。因此这被认为是极其卑贱的事。

---

## 解鞋带的比喻与基督的超越

So one reason some people just can't see how great they are is because they're, you know, they're just looking at themselves so much. They're, they're, they're always examining themselves. The other possibility, and it's more rare, but the other possibility is he's actually just not looking at himself much at all. He's not assessing himself. He's not looking at himself. You know why?

Because he's, he's looking at someone else and that's where John's going, but let's keep going here. Uh, so John's view, himself very, very low and actually mistakenly low. Then secondly, what's Jesus, John's view of Jesus?

Well, it's like nosebleed high when they begin to ask Jesus about Jesus. He's, uh, well, they begin to ask him about who is this person who is to come in verse 40, uh, pardon me in verse 23. Uh, John quotes Isaiah chapter 40. And he says, John replied in the word of God, Isaiah, the prophet, I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, make straight the way for the Lord.

Now, when he says, I'm all about helping this one who is to come. And John says, Isaiah prophesied about him in Isaiah 40, when he said, prepare the way of the Lord. Now, if you go back to Isaiah 40, you'll see that Isaiah had predicted that someday things would get so bad that God himself would come. To put things right.

And that we would build a highway for him through the desert. So basically it's, uh, it's, it's Isaiah predicting that God himself would come. And the word that I, uh, that Isaiah uses there is the word Yahweh will come. And Yahweh is the divine name. The, the name that God gave to Moses and the burning bushes, his personal name.

---

那么按照当时的习惯用语，施洗约翰本来应该怎么说呢？如果你站在一个伟大的人物或一位伟大的君王面前——事实上，如果他站在凯撒面前——约翰应该说的是："我只配给你解鞋带。"

除了这个之外，我不配做任何别的事。为什么呢？因为那是社会阶梯的最底层。谁要是只负责解鞋带，你就处在社会最底层的最底层的最底层。如果你说"我只配给你解鞋带"，那就是你在表达：我是一个无名小卒，我处在最底层。

但约翰说的不是这个。他说的是"我连给他解鞋带都不配"。他在修辞上所要表达的是：耶稣基督不同于地上的任何人。他不像凯撒，他甚至不像世界之王。如果你把凯撒和成吉思汗合为一体——因为你对一位国王说"我只配"，但不，施洗约翰说的是，那位将要来的远比任何地上的国王或皇帝都要高得多，以至于我连给他解鞋带都不配。

所以约翰对耶稣有着不可思议的崇高认识，同时对自己有着不可思议的低微看法。

## 谦卑与刚勇并存的品格

But John is applying this to Jesus. You see that by quoting Isaiah 40 and applying it to Jesus, John is saying that the one who is to come that I'm talking about is God himself. And then he actually does a little rhetorical flourish that really drives us home near the end. Verse 26. He says, um, among you stands one. You do not know.

You see this verse 26 and 27. Now that's why that's, that's, that's remarkably, uh, dramatic. John, uh, John says he's out there. He hasn't appeared yet.

But he's out there. He's with us. He might be standing there right now himself. He might actually be in the crowd right now. That's very dramatic.

But he's John knew that Jesus was about that he wasn't coming in 20 or 30 or 40 years. He was already here. But then he says, he is the one who comes after me. The straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

Now, you know, in every culture, there are some things that is so demeaning that no one is so offensive. And so demeaning that people don't want to do it. And in that culture, it was to untie the sandal. It was a hot, dusty culture. Uh, of course, people would come to, uh, into, uh, into a home. And, uh, the only people that would take off the smelly, dirty, foul, um, sandals off the shoe, off the feet had to be the lowest of the lowest of the low, the most menial of all the slaves.

There are rules that said nobody could be forced unless you were a slave. And so, uh, if you had any social status, no one can be forced to untie someone's sandal unless you were the lowest of the low. So it was considered incredibly demeaning.

Now what John the Baptist should have said in the, uh, you might say the, uh, he's using a figure of speech here. And what he should have said in the idiom of the time is this. If you stand before a great person or a great King, in fact, if he was standing in front of Caesar, what John, what you should say is this. I am only, worthy to untie your sandal.

There's nothing else I'm worthy of doing except that. Why?

Because that was the bottom of the social ladder. Anybody who just untied sandals, you were at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the social. And if you say, I am only worthy to untie your sandal, that was your way of saying that, you know, I am nobody. I'm at the very bottom. I, but that's not what he says. He says, I'm not even worthy to untie a sandal. And what he's doing there is he's rhetorically showing that Jesus Christ is, he's not like anyone else on earth.

He's not like Caesar. He's not even like the King of the world. If you had Caesar and Genghis Khan, you know, both rolled into one because you say to a King, I'm only worthy, but no, John, the Baptist is saying the one who is to come is so much higher than even an earth, any earthly King or emperor that I'm not even worthy to untie his, uh, his sandal.

So John has this incredibly high view of Jesus and this incredibly low view of himself.

What is the result? What would you think the result would be?

Not what we expect. And the re the here's the result. What kind of, what kind of personality does he have?

He's got an unbelievably bold personality. The way that comes out is down here in verse 24. He says, and 25 and 26.

Now the Pharisees who had sent been sent to question him said, why then see, why then, if you, if you, you didn't come through our schools and you're not the Messiah, you're not the Elijah, you're not the prophet. Where do you get the authority to baptize people the way you do now?

See, this is what, this is where it's coming. Uh, what's really been at. They've been after John's baptism ministry is like nothing you ever could imagine. Uh, in those days, people did get baptized, but only Gentiles were baptized when they converted to Judaism. Jews were never baptized. If you were a Gentile, you were considered very unclean.

And so when you, when you, uh, converted to Judaism, you were baptized because you, it was your way of saying I was very unclean, but now I'm becoming clean and you self-administered. See, if you were a Gentile converting to Judaism, as you converted, you, you washed yourself. And it was a way of saying you administered to yourself was a way of saying, you know, I've become clean now because I've, uh, you know, I've converted to Judaism, but that's not what John the Baptist was doing. And you know what he was doing.

First of all, he was baptizing everybody. He was demanding Jew and Gentile be baptized. If they're going to meet the Messiah, everybody, do you realize how radical that is?

He, he challenging the social, the religious order. He was challenging the religious order by saying, I don't care how pure you think you are. I don't care how moral you think you are. No amount of purity, no amount of morality, no amount of religiosity can possibly save you. You are lost. You need radical grace, but he was not only challenging the religious order, which is an astounding thing to do to save Jews have to be baptized as well as Gentiles, but he was challenging the social order because you know what that means. It means everybody's equal.

It means, it means whatever your record, whether you're religious or not religious, or whether you're a Jewish or pagan, whether you're Jew or Gentile, it doesn't matter what your race, everyone is equally lost. And therefore everyone can be equally saved through repentance. And therefore he was challenging the religious order. He's challenging the social order. And you know, he did the baptism himself. He didn't let anybody baptize themselves. He did it himself.

That is enormous boldness. That's innovation. That's revolution. He, he's challenging everybody and he was so incredibly bold. And you can even see it right here. When, if you look carefully at what he, what they say, well then why do you baptize?

Where do you get this authority? Who do you think you are?

See back up in verse 19, who do you think you are? Do you think you're the Messiah?

结果是什么呢？你会以为结果是什么？

不是我们所预期的。结果是这样的：他有什么样的性格？

他有一种令人难以置信的勇敢无畏的性格。这一点在第24和25、26节中显露出来。

经文说：

> "那些人是法利赛人差来的；他们就问他说：'你既不是基督，不是以利亚，也不是那先知，为什么施洗呢？'"
> ——约翰福音 1:24-25

你看，他们在追问的核心问题是——如果你没有经过我们的学校，你不是弥赛亚，你不是以利亚，你也不是那先知，那你凭什么有权柄像你这样给人施洗呢？

你看，这才是他们真正关心的问题。约翰的施洗事工是你完全无法想象的。在那个时代，人们确实会受洗，但只有外邦人在归入犹太教时才会受洗。犹太人从来不受洗。如果你是外邦人，你被认为是非常不洁净的。所以当你归入犹太教的时候，你要受洗，因为这是你表达"我曾经非常不洁净，但现在我要变得洁净"的方式，而且你是自己给自己施洗。你看，如果你是一个归入犹太教的外邦人，在归信的过程中，你自己洗净自己，这是一种方式来表明"我现在洁净了，因为我已经归入犹太教了"。

但施洗约翰做的不是这样。你知道他在做什么吗？

首先，他给所有人施洗。他要求犹太人和外邦人都要受洗。如果他们要迎见弥赛亚——所有人都要受洗。你意识到这是多么激进吗？

他在挑战宗教秩序。他通过宣告"我不管你认为自己多么纯洁，我不管你认为自己多么道德，任何程度的纯洁、任何程度的道德、任何程度的虔诚都不可能拯救你——你是失丧的，你需要彻底的恩典"来挑战宗教秩序。但他不仅挑战了宗教秩序——这本身就是一件惊天动地的事，说犹太人也必须像外邦人一样受洗——他还在挑战社会秩序。因为你知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着所有人都是平等的。

这意味着，无论你的记录如何，无论你有没有宗教信仰，无论你是犹太人还是异教徒，无论你是犹太人还是外邦人，无论你的种族是什么——每个人都同样是失丧的。因此每个人都可以通过悔改同样得到拯救。所以他在挑战宗教秩序，他在挑战社会秩序。而且你知道吗，他亲自为人施洗。他不让任何人自己给自己施洗，而是他亲自来做。

这是何等的勇敢。这是创新，这是革命。他在挑战所有人，他无比的勇敢无畏。你甚至在这段经文中就能看到这一点。如果你仔细看他们的质问——"那你为什么施洗？你凭什么有这个权柄？你以为你是谁？"

你看，回到第19节——"你以为你是谁？你以为你是弥赛亚吗？""不是。""那先知？""不是。""以利亚？""不是。""那你这一切勇气从何而来？你怎么敢施洗？谁给了你施洗的权柄？"

你知道他怎么回答的吗？

> "约翰回答说：'我是用水施洗。'"
> ——约翰福音 1:26

他没有回答那个问题。"你为什么施洗？""我施洗。"你知道他在说什么吗？

我不需要回答你。我不在乎你怎么想。

你知道，我最喜欢的电影之一，其实是1965年的一部老电影，叫《万世流芳》（The Greatest Story Ever Told），讲的是耶稣的故事。我喜欢的是——虽然里面有一点过度表演，但我喜欢。查尔顿·赫斯顿（Charlton Heston）饰演施洗约翰。如果你想看到对施洗约翰精彩的演绎，虽然其中有很多东西是好莱坞加进去的，不在圣经里，但仍然忠实于圣经的精神。查尔顿·赫斯顿把施洗约翰演绎成一个勇敢无畏的人。

他就是勇敢无畏的。所以他总是在喊："悔改！悔改！悔改！"当士兵来试图逮捕他的时候，我最喜欢的一幕——当士兵们来抓他的时候，他把他们摔在地上，喊着："悔改！悔改！"

然后他们制服了他，把他带到希律王面前。他看见希律站在他妻子旁边，就说："那是你兄弟的妻子，悔改吧！"希律说："你会因此丧命的。"施洗约翰说："你会因此下地狱的。"

然后，你知道的，希律说："我可以让人杀了你。"施洗约翰说："那只会让我获得自由。"于是，当然，希律让人把施洗约翰拖到画面之外去斩首了。我们稍后再回来说这件事。

但说实话，虽然那些对话当然都不在圣经里，但它们忠实于圣经的精神。施洗约翰就是那样的人。

## 超越表现主义的身份认同

No. The prophet?

No. Elijah?

No. Well then, where does all this boldness come from?

How dare you baptize? Who gives you the right to baptize?

And you know what he says? I baptize. I baptize with water. He doesn't say, he doesn't answer the question. Why then do you baptize?

I baptize. You know what he's saying?

I don't need to answer you. I don't, I don't care what you think.

You know, one of my favorite movies, actually, it's an old 1965 movie called The Greatest Story Ever Told, story of Jesus, you know. And what I like is there's a little bit of overacting in it, but I like it. And Charlton Heston plays John the Baptist. And if you ever want a great depiction of John the Baptist, though there's lots of stuff that's written in there, Hollywood put it in, it's not in the Bible, but it's still true to the idea. Charlton Heston plays John the Baptist as a bold one.

He was bold. So he's always saying, repent, repent, repent. When the soldiers come, I love it, when the soldiers come to try to arrest him, he starts throwing them on the ground, saying, repent, repent, you know.

And then they overwhelm him. And they bring him to Herod. And he sees Herod standing next to his wife. And he says, that's your brother's wife, repent. And Herod says, you'll die for that. And John the Baptist says, you'll go to hell for that.

So they, you know, Herod says, I can have you killed. And John the Baptist says, that'll only free me. And so, of course, Herod has John the Baptist hauled off, off camera to be beheaded. We'll get back to minute.

But honestly, even though none of that, of course, none of those little dialogues are in the Bible, it's true to the Bible. John the Baptist was like that. Now, here's what, here's the point, what I've been leading up to is to say, do you understand that it's hard for us modern people to understand how to explain John the Baptist's personality and his identity?

Because he has a low view of himself, but he's incredibly bold. See, we know people who are very confident of their ability, and then they're bold. Or people who have very, very low confidence in their own ability, and therefore they're hesitant and diffident.

But here's a guy who unites humility and boldness. He's incredibly humble and sensitive, and yet absolutely fearless. Absolutely fearless.

Now, the reason why that shocks us, or at least we have trouble explaining it, is because we do not know today, in fact, human beings have never known, an identity, and this is what this is all about. Verse 19, who are you?

Who do you think you are? What's your identity?

We don't know of any identities that aren't basically performance-based. A performance-based identity is an achieved identity. You have to achieve it. And you know, it really doesn't matter what part of the world you come from.

---

好了，这就是我一直在铺垫的重点：你们理解吗——对于我们现代人来说，很难解释施洗约翰的性格和身份。

因为他对自己的评价很低，但他却无比勇敢。你看，我们认识的人当中，有些人对自己的能力非常自信，所以他们很勇敢；或者有些人对自己的能力完全没有信心，所以他们犹豫退缩。

但这里有一个人，将谦卑与勇敢合而为一。他极其谦卑和敏锐，同时又绝对无所畏惧。绝对无所畏惧。

我们之所以对此感到震惊，或者至少难以解释，是因为我们今天不知道——事实上人类从来就不知道——一种不是基本上以表现为基础的身份认同。这正是这段经文的核心主题。第19节：你是谁？你以为你是谁？你的身份是什么？

我们不知道有任何身份认同不是本质上以表现为基础的。以表现为基础的身份认同就是一种靠成就获得的身份。你必须通过自己的成就来获得它。而且，这真的不取决于你来自世界的哪个地方。

你看，在西方文化中，你自己决定你想成为什么样的人。而在许多传统文化中，你们中很多人就来自那些传统文化，是你的家人来决定你应该成为什么样的人，对吧？

所以在西方，问题是：你想成为谁？在世界其他地方，答案是：我的父母说，这是你应该成为的人，这是我们希望你成为的人。在世界许多地方，你的身份认同根植于取悦你的父母、达到他们的标准，对吧？

好的？所以你们很多人都明白这一点，因为你们在两种文化中都生活过。但在这个文化中，是要达到你自己的标准。

换句话说——我想成为一个艺术家，我想成为某某某，我想在商业上取得成功。我想做这些那些事情。所以你自己决定你想成为什么样的人，你不让父母来告诉你。

但然后你必须活出那个标准。虽然这两种方式看起来截然不同，但它们本质上是一样的——因为你的自我价值感根植于你做得有多好。这是以表现为基础的。如果你达到了标准，你就自我感觉良好。如果你没有达到标准，你就感觉糟糕透了。

这就是为什么——我们只知道：如果你觉得"我表现得不错"，那么这类人是自信的，但不谦卑也不敏锐。或者如果你觉得"我在失败"，这些人通常是破碎的，他们在参加互助小组，他们谦卑而敏锐，但不自信。而这里有一个人既谦卑又自信。你知道为什么吗？

因为他的身份认同不是以表现为基础的。事实上，如果你仔细想想，当你看施洗约翰、读到关于他的记载时，他根本就没有在看自己。真的没有。

从某种意义上说，他没有什么自我意识。他既没有高看自己，也没有低看自己——他根本就不怎么想自己。他没有优越感，也没有自卑感。他的自我既没有膨胀，也没有萎缩。他只是没有在看自己。他在注视另一个人。

这正是产生这两种品质的根源。你看，即使是约翰——此时此刻，跟我们比起来，他对福音的认识少之又少，他还不知道十字架或任何那些事情——即使是约翰也知道：就我自己而言，我什么都不是；但在他里面，我就是一切。就我自己而言，我什么都不是。

但当我注视他，哪怕只是想到他，就令我充满荣耀的喜乐。你看，即使他也在获得这种独特的、非同寻常的身份认同——不是根植于他自己的表现，而是以某种方式根植于耶稣，根植于他与耶稣的关系。

## 道成肉身如何赐给我们新身份

See, here in Western culture, you decide who you want to be. Now, there's many traditional cultures, and lots of you are from those traditional cultures, where your family decides who you should be, right?

So here in the West, the question is, who do you want to be? In other parts of the world, the answer is, my mother and father say, this is who you should be, and this is who we want you to be. And in many parts of the world, your identity is rooted in pleasing your parents, living up to their standards, right?

Okay? So a lot of you know that, because you've been in both cultures. But here in this culture, it's living up to your own standards.

In other words, I want to be an artist. I want to be, you know, this. I want to be successful in business.

I want to do all these things. So you decide who you want to be. You don't let your parents tell you.

But then you have to live up to it. And as different as those seem to be, they're the same, because your sense of self-worth is rooted in how well you're doing. It's performance-based. And if you're if you're living up to standards, then you feel good about yourself. And if you're not living up to standards, you feel terrible about yourself.

And that's the reason why we only know that if you feel like I'm performing well, well, then those kinds of people are confident, but not humble and sensitive. Or if you feel like I'm failing, those people are actually usually broken and they're going to 12 step groups and they're, you know, and they're, and they're humble and sensitive, but they're not confident. But here's a guy who is both humble and confident. You know why?

Because he didn't have a performance-based identity. In fact, if you think about it, when you look at John the Baptist and read about him, he's not looking at himself at all. He really isn't.

There's like no ego there in a way. You know, he's not, he's not thinking more of himself or thinking less of himself. He's thinking of himself less. He's not, he's not got a superiority complex or it's, inferiority complex. He's not, he's not got an inflated ego or a deflated ego. He just is not looking at himself. He's looking at somebody else.

And that's what both leads him. See, even John, who knew so little of the gospel compared to us at this point, didn't know anything about the cross or any of those things. And yet even John knows in myself, I'm nothing, but in him, I'm everything. In myself, I'm nothing.

But when I look at him and if I even think of him, it fills me with, glorious joy. See, even he was getting this kind of unique, unusual identity that wasn't rooted in his performance, but it's somehow rooted in what Jesus, in his relationship to Jesus. How can we get this kind of identity?

And the answer is, actually, there's a hint of it right here. John didn't know he was being a prophet, but he says in verse 27, he is the one who, comes after me, and the straps of whose sandals I'm not worthy to untie. Now, if you've been coming to church here, you know that we were looking later on in John chapter 13 to 17 is Jesus Christ's last time with his disciples before he dies. And you know, you will know this, that actually the gospel writer, John, is foreshadowing what he's going to write about later.

But John the Baptist doesn't know he was prophesying something. Because the night before Jesus Christ, was to die, he gets down on his knees, he shocked his disciples. He got down on his knees. He didn't just untie their sandals.

Now, here's the person, no one in the world is even worthy to untie his sandals. Yet this person, so high, comes down so low, and not only goes around to his disciples and unties their sandals, but then washes their feet too. And they're all shocked. Wait a minute, you know, this is not seemly, this is not right. On your knees to us, and Peter says, you must not wash my feet. And of course, Jesus says, Peter, if I don't wash your feet, you're not going to be saved.

And that's Jesus' way of saying, this is just a symbol, Peter, of what I have done and what I'm about to do. See, if Jesus Christ had come down from heaven in great majesty only, and he landed here, and he called to us all, and he said, those of you who want God's blessing, follow me and imitate me. And, you know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, and live lives like I'm living, and summons up your strength, and be good, and then you will be blessed. If he had done that, he would have been just giving us one more identity like everybody else's identity, based on performance. Up and down, depending on our performance. You know, bold or humble, but never both at once. You getting this?

我们怎样才能获得这种身份认同呢？

答案是——实际上就在这段经文中有一个暗示。约翰并不知道他是在说预言，但他在第27节说：

> "就是那在我以后来的，我给他解鞋带也不配。"
> ——约翰福音 1:27

如果你一直来我们教会，你知道我们之前在看约翰福音第13到17章——那是耶稣基督在死前最后一次与门徒在一起的时光。你也会知道，福音书的作者约翰在这里其实是在预示他后面将要写到的内容。

但施洗约翰自己并不知道他是在预言什么。因为就在耶稣基督受死的前一夜，他跪了下来——他震惊了他的门徒们。他跪了下来。他不只是解开了他们的鞋带。

想想看——这位世上没有任何人配给他解鞋带的那一位，这位如此尊高的那一位，降到如此卑微的地步。他不仅走到每个门徒面前解开他们的鞋带，还洗了他们的脚。他们都震惊了。"等等，这不合适，这不对。你跪在我们面前？"彼得说："你绝不可洗我的脚。"

> "彼得说：'你永不可洗我的脚！'耶稣说：'我若不洗你，你就与我无分了。'"
> ——约翰福音 13:8

这是耶稣在表达：彼得，这不过是一个象征，象征着我已经做了和即将要做的事。

你看，如果耶稣基督仅仅以荣耀的威严从天降下，降临在这里，然后召唤我们所有人说："你们当中想要得到上帝祝福的，跟从我、效法我，过像我一样的生活，鼓起你们的力量，做个好人，然后你们就会蒙福。"如果他那样做，他不过是给了我们又一个和所有其他身份认同一样的身份——以表现为基础的，随着我们的表现而起起落落。你知道的——要么勇敢，要么谦卑，但永远不能两者兼备。你们跟上了吗？

但他不是以威严降下的，他是以谦卑降下的。他倒空了自己的荣耀。他无佳形美容使我们羡慕他。他看起来平凡得难以置信。

然后他走上了十字架，他在那里所做的是——他代替我们成就了一切。你看，他活出了完美的一生，他赚取了永生的祝福，但他却代替我们死了。他承担了我们的刑罚。这意味着，当我借着耶稣基督相信上帝的时候，是他的表现成为我与上帝关系的基础，上帝对我的爱是永不改变的、无条件的。无论我是顺境还是逆境。

你知道这意味着什么吗？

一方面，这意味着什么？这意味着你被谦卑到尘埃里。你看，每个人都必须受洗，每个人都必须悔改。无论你取得了什么成就，都无关紧要。每个人都一样。如果不是因为耶稣基督所做的，你完全是失丧的。

这使你谦卑下来，而且永远不会停止使你谦卑。永远。从某种意义上说，你永远不会从地上站起来。

但另一方面，你被肯定到天际。你拥有了不可失去的爱。它不会失去。它不会随着你的表现而起起落落。

所以施洗约翰身上那种谦卑与勇敢的结合，你也可以拥有。

## 身份认同的试金石

But he didn't come down in majesty, he came down in humility. He emptied himself of his glory. He had no beauty that we should desire him. He looked unbelievably ordinary.

And then he went to the cross, and what he did there was he performed for us. See, he lived a perfect life, and he earned the blessing of eternal life, but then he died a death in our place. He took our penalty. That means that when I believe in God through Jesus Christ, it's his performance that's the basis for my relationship with God, and God loves me infallibly and unconditionally. Regardless of whether I'm up or down, and you know what that means?

On the one hand, it means, what does it mean? It means you're humbled into the dust. See, everyone has to be baptized. Everyone has to repent. It doesn't matter what you've accomplished. Everybody's the same. You are absolutely lost if it wasn't for what Jesus Christ did.

That humbles you, and it never stops humbling you. Never. You never get off the floor, in a sense, for that.

But on the other hand, you're affirmed to the sky. You've got love that can't be lost. It can't be lost. It doesn't go up and down depending on how you're performing.

And so this mixture of humility and boldness that John the Baptist had, you can have too. One of my favorite quotes is by Isaac Dennison, who says this about people who don't know whether there's a God. Maybe they're here by accident, and she says this. She says, there's people who do not know that God made them, and they have to. They have to accept as success what others warrant to be so, and to take their happiness, even their own selves, at the quotation of the day. Do you hear that?

It says so many people, they have to accept as success what others warrant it to be so. In other words, who are you?

Are you saying, well, I know I'm a good person because I'm pleasing my parents? Well, then, they define success. Or you say, well, no, no, I'm accomplishing. You know, whenever people in our society say, I don't care what anybody else thinks. I've decided who I want to be.

Well, that's not exactly true. You know, whenever people say to me, well, I feel really good about myself because I've, you know, and I've decided who I want to be. I don't care what anybody thinks. I said, okay, well, why do you feel good about yourself?

And you say, well, I'm a great piano player. I'm a great, you know, I'm working on this. I never hear anybody say, well, I feel really great about myself because, you know, when I put, when I get in my bare feet and I step into the mud and I wiggle my toes, the mud comes up through the toes.

Now, the reason nobody says that is because nobody values that. You see, when people say, well, I just decided that because toe, you know, you know, mud comes from my toes that I'm a good person. Nobody, see, here's the point is you care about what people think.

That's what you care about. You think, oh, I'm defining myself. No, no, no. In traditional cultures, my parents think in Western cultures with everybody thinks, especially on Twitter, you can, you know, I need social recognition. I need affirmation.

See what she's saying? She's saying apart from this new identity you get in Jesus Christ, you have to accept this success. What others warrant it to be so, and to take your own selves and your, even your happiness at the quotation of the day, other people are defining you. You think, oh no, nobody's defined. Yes, they are. Because if, if your identity is based on your performance, living up to your standards, or if it's a based on a performance, living up to your parents' standards or the cultures or one of the reasons why people are always demonizing other people is a performance-based identities always to some degree at the expense of other people.

In other words, if you're proud of being smart, you're really not proud of being smart. You're proud of being smarter than other people. So when you're around people that you're, that are, you think are dumber than you love just to, to bolster your self-image by thinking, look how stupid they are. You know, you're not proud of having money. You're proud of having more money than other people.

And so you, look, I've got this and these people don't, they can't even afford this. You see, there's the world's identity always is unstable for you. And the world's identities are always lead you to exclude and demonize other people.

But in Jesus Christ, when your identity is not, is absolutely stable, there's no fragility to it. It's absolutely certain. So you can be bold. You don't care what people think, but at the same time, there's no one you feel superior to. You're humbled enough to not feel superior to anybody and bold enough, not to care what anybody thinks. Don't you want that?

I do. And of course it, nobody, no Christian, it's a Christian gift, but nobody's living. We're not living into it as we should. And here's how we're going to end.

我最喜欢的一句话是伊萨克·丹尼森（Isak Dinesen）说的，她这样描述那些不知道是否有上帝存在的人——也许他们的存在只是一个偶然——她这样说。她说：有些人不知道是上帝创造了他们，他们不得不接受别人所认定的成功来作为自己的成功，不得不按照当天的行情来衡量他们的幸福，甚至他们的自我。

你听到了吗？她说，太多人"不得不接受别人所认定的成功来作为自己的成功"。换句话说——你是谁？你是不是在说："我知道我是个好人，因为我让父母满意了"？那么，是他们在定义成功。或者你说："不不不，我在取得成就。"你知道，每当我们社会中有人说"我不在乎别人怎么想，我自己决定我要成为谁"的时候——

嗯，那并不完全正确。每当有人对我说"我对自己感觉非常好，因为我已经决定了我要成为谁，我不在乎别人怎么想"——我就说："好吧，那你为什么对自己感觉好呢？"

然后你会说："因为我是一个出色的钢琴家。我是一个了不起的……我在做这个那个。"我从来没有听到任何人说："我对自己感觉很好，因为当我光着脚踩进泥里，扭动脚趾头的时候，泥巴从脚趾缝里冒出来。"

没有人会这么说，因为没有人看重那件事。你看，当有人说"我就是因为脚趾泥巴的事而觉得自己是个好人"——没人会这么说。重点在这里：你在乎别人怎么想。

这才是你真正在乎的。你以为——哦，我在定义自己。不不不。在传统文化中，是我父母怎么想；在西方文化中，是所有人怎么想——尤其是在推特上，你需要社会认同，你需要别人的肯定。

你看到她在说什么吗？她说，如果没有你在耶稣基督里获得的这个新身份，你就不得不接受别人所认定的成功来作为自己的成功，不得不按照当天的行情来衡量你自己的幸福甚至你自己——别人在定义你。你以为"哦不，没有人在定义我"。但是他们确实在定义你。因为如果你的身份认同是基于你的表现——达到你自己的标准，或者基于你的表现——达到你父母的标准或者文化的标准。这也是为什么人们总是妖魔化别人的原因之一——以表现为基础的身份认同在某种程度上总是建立在踩着别人之上的。

换句话说，如果你因为聪明而骄傲，你其实不是因为聪明而骄傲——你是因为比别人聪明而骄傲。所以当你身边有你认为比你笨的人时，你就喜欢用他们来支撑你的自我形象，心想"看他们多蠢"。你不是因为有钱而骄傲，你是因为比别人有钱而骄傲。

所以你就会想——看，我有这个那个，而这些人连这个都买不起。你看，世界给你的身份认同对你来说永远是不稳定的。世界给你的身份认同总是导致你排斥和妖魔化别人。

但在耶稣基督里，当你的身份认同是绝对稳固的，没有任何脆弱性，是绝对确定的——你就可以勇敢无畏。你不在乎别人怎么想。但同时，你不觉得自己比任何人优越。你足够谦卑，不会觉得自己比任何人优越；你足够勇敢，不在乎任何人怎么想。你难道不想要这样的品格吗？

我想要。当然，没有任何基督徒——这是基督徒的恩赐——但没有人真正活出了我们应当活出的样式。

## 你是否敢于做一个声音

Here's a test. Maybe it's a little bit of weird of a test to be talking to you about at Christmas, uh, service, but here's the test. If you have one of these wonderful identities that you've lived into your Christian identity, Oh, Christian, like John the Baptist, humble enough, not to actually really be superior to anybody, but bold enough, not to care what anybody thinks. One of the tests that you've got an identity like that is actually, you're pretty good at talking to other people about Jesus, even in New York city, where everybody gets so upset. If you talk about your faith and you're afraid of people not liking you, if you talk about your faith, well, see, that means you're not bold. You do. You care what people think you are taking yourself at the quotation of the day.

But on the other hand, if you come across as abrasive and you put people off, that shows you don't have the humility either. What I love about John the Baptist is, do you know, here, here's how we're going to conclude. Do you realize that when they keep saying, who are you?

Who are you? No. Are you?

No. Are you?

No. Does he ever answer?

He does actually. Do you see what he calls himself?

I'm a voice. I love it. He says, I'm just a voice. Who are you?

I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Prepare the way of the Lord. And it's his way of saying in myself, I'm nobody.

But as I talk about Jesus Christ, then I know that the power of God is coming through me into other people's lives. I don't have to feel like I'm a great person. I don't have to feel like I'm eloquent. I'm just a voice. Do you have the boldness and the humility to talk to people about Jesus?

What I really love, by the way, about the way John the Baptist dies in the greatest story ever told, I told you that what they do, what the camera does is the camera just shows you Herod's face. It was, by the way, played by Jose Ferrer, who didn't do a bad job. He shows Herod's face and he says, you know, be away. You're going to die.

So they, they pull John the Baptist off camera and you can hear him going away. Repent, repent, repent, repent, going further away. And finally, one last time he goes, he says, repent. And you hear chunk down comes the blade. He's dead.

But of course, it all happens when you're still, the camera's on Herod. And then after the blade has come down after the chunk, after, you know, he's dead suddenly. And this was a brilliant move on the part of the movie maker. Suddenly you're still seeing Herod, but you in Herod's ear, the word comes, repent. What?

I remember the first time I watched this and I was like 19 years old. The first time I watched it, I was thinking, what?

He's dead. Why is he still here and repent?

We'll see. He's a voice. He couldn't, you can't kill the voice. Uh, all he's there is to point the way to Jesus. And when you point the way to Jesus, that can't, that can't be stopped. You're not pointing at yourself.

这是我们的结束之词。这里有一个检验的标准。也许在圣诞节的聚会上跟你们谈这个有点奇怪，但这就是那个标准。如果你拥有了这种美好的身份认同——你已经活进了你基督徒身份中，像施洗约翰那样，谦卑到不会真正觉得自己比任何人优越，却勇敢到不在乎任何人怎么想——检验你是否拥有这种身份认同的标志之一就是：你其实很擅长跟别人谈论耶稣。即使在纽约这样一个地方，人们一听你谈信仰就会很不高兴。

如果你害怕别人因为你谈信仰而不喜欢你，那说明你不够勇敢。你确实在乎别人怎么想。你在按照当天的行情来衡量自己。

但另一方面，如果你给人的感觉是咄咄逼人，让人退避三舍，那说明你也缺少谦卑。

我喜欢施洗约翰的一点是——你知道吗，我们以此来作结。你有没有注意到，当他们一直在问"你是谁？你是谁？""不是。""你是……？""不是。""你是……？""不是。"他到底有没有回答过？

他确实回答了。你看到他怎么称呼自己的吗？

"我是一个声音。"我太喜欢这个回答了。他说："我只是一个声音。"你是谁？

> "我就是那在旷野有人声喊着说：'修直主的道路'。"
> ——约翰福音 1:23

这是他在表达：就我自己而言，我什么都不是。但当我讲论耶稣基督的时候，我知道上帝的能力正透过我流入别人的生命中。我不需要觉得自己是个了不起的人。我不需要觉得自己口才出众。我只是一个声音。

你有没有勇气和谦卑去跟别人谈论耶稣？

顺便说一下，我真的很喜欢施洗约翰在《万世流芳》中死去的那个场景。我告诉过你们，电影的镜头只展示希律王的面部——顺便说一下，那是何塞·费勒（Jose Ferrer）演的，演得不差。镜头对准希律王的脸，希律说："拖下去，你要死了。"

他们把施洗约翰拖到画面之外，你能听到他越走越远还在喊："悔改！悔改！悔改！悔改！"声音越来越远。最后，他喊了最后一声："悔改！"然后你听到"咔嚓"一声，刀落了下来。他死了。

但当然，这一切发生的时候，镜头始终对着希律。在刀落之后、"咔嚓"之后——他已经死了。但突然间——这是电影制作者的一个绝妙手笔——你仍然看着希律，但你听到在希律的耳边传来一个声音："悔改。"什么？

我记得我第一次看这部电影的时候，我才十九岁。第一次看的时候，我心想："什么？他已经死了，为什么还有悔改的声音？"

你明白了吗？他就是一个声音。你杀不死那个声音。他存在的全部意义就是为人指明通向耶稣的道路。而当你为人指明通向耶稣的道路时，那是不可能被阻止的。你不是在指向自己。

你看，你觉得自己软弱吗？你觉得自己太软弱而无法向别人指明耶稣吗？你觉得太软弱了？那就更好了。

## 结束祷告

See, if you, do you feel weak? Do you feel too weak to point people to Jesus?

Do you feel too weak? All the better. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that, uh, you have offered us, uh, in the word of God, uh, a unique identity that other people don't have a reason that don't have access. They don't have access to it. And, uh, in John the Baptist, we see a forerunner of this. He's kind of a prototype.

He's too humble to feel superior to anyone. So he's winsome, but he's too bold of care, what everybody thinks. And so he's an innovator. He's a revolutionary. Oh Lord, that mixture of boldness, humility, how we want it, how we long for it. Um, and Frank, frankly, Lord, the world needs people like that.

And so we pray that you would recreate the, uh, this identity of John the Baptist, which is the Christian identity in us to the power of your Holy spirit through faith in Jesus Christ. In his name we pray. Amen.

---

让我们祷告。天父，我们感谢你，你在你的话语中赐给我们一种独特的身份认同——这是其他人无法拥有的，他们无法获得的。在施洗约翰身上，我们看到了这种身份的雏形。他是某种原型。

他谦卑到不会觉得自己比任何人优越，所以他很有吸引力；但他也勇敢到不在乎任何人怎么想，所以他是创新者，是变革者。主啊，这种勇敢与谦卑的结合，我们是多么渴望、多么向往。而且，主啊，坦率地说，这个世界需要这样的人。

因此我们祈求，你能借着你圣灵的能力、借着对耶稣基督的信心，在我们里面重新塑造施洗约翰的那种身份认同——那就是基督徒的身份认同。奉他的名祷告。阿们。
