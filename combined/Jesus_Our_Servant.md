## 上帝之子的祷告日记 / The Prayer Diary of the Son of God

Now, as we approach Christmas, if you come to a church, you are going to hear people asking the question, why did Jesus come and reflect on it?

Why did Jesus come? Now, we have been looking at the Psalms of the Old Testament all fall. My question, of course, to you would be, why would we look one more time at the Psalms to find out anything about Jesus?

This Psalm that we just read, Psalm 69, is quoted by Jesus in an interesting and remarkable way. In John chapter 15, he is discussing with his disciples the fact that people are opposed to him and the fact that there is so much hostility to him. And then he says, in verse 25 of John chapter 15, he says, this is to fulfill what the scripture said about me.

When it said they have hated me without cause, and he quotes Psalm 69, what's going on? Here's what's going on. Jesus says Psalm 69, of course, is written by David, and it's about David, the king, and his immediate problems and the people that hate him.

But it actually does not have a single horizon, it's got two horizons, it doesn't have just one reference, it's got two reference. It not only refers to David and his problems, but it refers to one who is greater than David, a greater warrior, a greater king, and far greater suffering, it's talking about me. What we mean is that not every single part of this Psalm, but what we understand is that Jesus read this Psalm and read it and read it and identified with it and understood the language of this Psalm to actually describe what he was going to go through.

If you've ever had a friend who's going through tremendous suffering, imagine you know a friend going through tremendous suffering, and you come across her diary, would you read it? You know, you treated his sacred, wouldn't you? You wonder, maybe you shouldn't even pick it up, but if you did pick it up, you treat it with great reverence.

Well, that's what you've got here. You've got the prayer diary of the Son of God and an expression in the first person of his anguish and his sufferings for us. Now, what we learned from it is much, but we only have time today, as we prepare to go to the Lord's table, to look at three things that we learned from the Psalm, from his prayer diary, about what he came to do.

He came, first of all, to be a servant, second of all, to be hated and thirdly to be exchanged, to be a servant, to be hated to be exchanged. The first point is the longest, the second point is the shortest, the third point is the most important. First of all, he came to be a servant.

现在临近圣诞节了，如果你来到教堂，你会听到人们在思考一个问题：耶稣为什么来，并且会反思这个问题。

耶稣为什么来？我们整个秋季都在研读旧约中的诗篇。当然，我会问你们：为什么我们要再看一次这些诗篇，从中找到有关耶稣的信息？刚刚读过的诗篇69篇，耶稣以一种有趣而显著的方式引用了它。

在约翰福音15章中，他和他的门徒讨论到人们对他的反对和敌意。然后他在约翰福音15章25节说：“这是要应验经上的话。” 当它说他们恨我无故时，他引用诗篇69篇，这是什么意思？耶稣说：诗篇69篇当然由大卫所写，是关于大卫王和他的即刻问题以及那些恨他的人民。

但其实它并不是只有一个视角，而是有两个视角，不只是一个参照点，而是有两个参照点。它不仅是指大卫和他的困境，更是指向一位比大卫更伟大的人——一位更伟大的战士、更伟大的君王，也是一位更为深重的受苦者。这诗篇所讲的是我。我们理解的意思是，并不是诗篇中的每一个部分都如此，但我们知道耶稣读过这首诗篇，一遍又一遍地读，从中找到了共鸣，理解了其中的语言正是在描述他将要经历的一切。

如果你曾经有一个正遭受巨大痛苦的朋友，想象一下你发现她的日记本，你会不会去读？你知道，你会把它当作是神圣的东西来对待。或许你会犹豫是否应该拿起它，但一旦拿起，你会以极大的敬意来对待。现在，你就面对着上帝儿子的祈祷日记，以及他亲身表达的痛苦和为我们所受的苦难。

从中学到的东西很多，但我们今天作为预备参加主餐的时候，只能看三个方面，从这首诗篇中了解到关于耶稣来做什么的信息。首先，他是来作仆人的；其次，是被人恨恶的；最后，是被交换的。这三个要点中，第一个最长，第二个最短，第三个最重要。首先是来作仆人。

## 他来是为了降卑 / He Came to Sink

You know, you notice in verse 17, he says, why have you hidden your face from your servant? And in the very beginning of the paragraph, or the very beginning of the Psalm, he says, I sink. Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck.

I sink into my red depths where there is no foothold. What did Jesus come to do? He came to sink, that's the first point.

He came to sink. He came to be a servant. That's what a servant does, a servant sinks.

We read Philippians 2 earlier in the service. It's all about exactly what it means for Jesus to come as a servant and to sink. There's a new book out now that's very popular written by a pastor called Descending Indigrateness, based on Philippians 2.

Years ago, another pastor, a famous pastor named Donald Green Barnhouse used to start his sermons this way. The way up is down. The way to go down is to go up.

And what justifies that language is this, this very thing. Philippians 2, Psalm 69, the Bible says, Jesus Christ came to sink because that's what servants do. When you look at Philippians 2, you see it.

Jesus actually took two huge steps down. That's what it means to be a servant, to go down. He goes, we're told, from heaven to earth.

It says, though he was equal with God, he didn't hold on to that equality, but was found in the form of a servant, he became a human being. And you know, when you think of the incarnation, God becoming incarnate, in the flesh, God becoming human being, you've got to get out of your mind. The Christmas cards with little sweet baby Jesus asleep on the hay, it looks like an ivory soap commercial.

你注意，在第17节中，他说："为什么将你的脸隐藏不向你的仆人？"在诗篇的开头，他说道：“我下沉了，主啊，求你拯救我，因为水已漫到我的颈项。” 我沉入血泊之中，没有立足之地。耶稣来做什么？

他来就是下沉，这是第一个要点。他来作仆人，下沉。仆人的本分就是要下沉。我们在礼拜中早些时候读了腓立比书2章。

这一章节完全讲的是耶稣作为仆人降卑的意义。现在有一本新书非常流行，书名是《降卑的恩典》，作者是一位牧师，这本书也是基于腓立比书2章。几年前，另一位著名的牧师唐纳德·格林·巴诺斯在布道时常常这样开头：上路就是下路；要下路就要上路。而这种说法背后的依据正是这一段经文——腓立比书2章。

圣经说，耶稣基督来降卑是因为仆人就是这样做的。当你读到腓立比书2章时，你就会明白这一点。耶稣实际上走了两步很大的降卑之路。这就是作为仆人的意义，就是去降卑。

他从天上降到地上。经文说：“虽然他在神面前是平等的，却甘愿放弃这种平等，取了奴仆的形象，成为人的样式。”当你想到道成肉身，神成为人，你必须抛开那种想法。那些圣诞卡片上睡在稻草上的可爱小耶稣，看起来就像是象牙肥皂广告。

## 道成肉身的暴烈 / The Violence of the Incarnation

I know you have to understand and you do understand it when you read Psalm 69. You have to understand the violence of the incarnation. The incarnation was an act of violence against Jesus.

Something he willingly took. Violence. Think for a moment with me.

What is so violent about prison? What is so dehumanizing and terrible about going to prison? You stripped of your freedom.

You stripped of your personal possessions. What was so horrifying about that event some years ago? I think it was in the New York area, wasn't it?

Where a man, because he was angry at a young woman who was a lovely model, had her face carved up, was not in the New York area, also horrifying of that. Here's someone with great beauty, stripped of her beauty. Let me tell you, the incarnation was the greatest stripping that's ever happened.

Here is the fairest among 10,000. Here is the beautiful son of God, and his beauty is ripped out of him and he's cast into this figure. And his wealth is ripped out of him and he's cast into poverty.

And the love he had with the Father is ripped out of him and he's cast into loneliness. And the joy he had is ripped out of him and he's cast into grief and the power is ripped out of him and he's cast into weakness. You understand the violence of the incarnation?

God becomes human. What does that mean? He became a cell at one point.

You know, we confess it every time we say he was conceived by the Holy Spirit. God became the weakest form of life in the universe. It was vulnerable form, a cell.

Then he became a baby. His hands on nippeted hands, you see, now flailing away impotently. The omnipotent Lord of the universe has to be changed when he soils himself.

He can't change himself. The violence of the incarnation, he sank. He came to sink.

And he didn't just—Philippines II doesn't just tell us there's one step down. He took two steps. He didn't just come from heaven to earth.

我知道你们读诗篇69时会理解这一点。你们必须明白道成肉身的暴力性。道成肉身是对耶稣的一种暴力行为。这是一种他自愿接受的暴力。

让我们想一想。监禁有什么如此暴力的地方？监禁有什么如此使人失去人性和可怕之处？你失去了自由，失去了个人财产。

几年前发生在纽约地区的一件事件是多么令人震惊啊！一个男人因为对一位美丽的模特生气而毁掉了她的容貌，这件事并非发生在纽约地区，但同样令人震惊。这里有一个美丽的人被剥夺了她的美貌。让我告诉你，道成肉身是从未发生过的最大剥夺。

最美好的人中最美的一员，神的儿子，他的美被夺走，他被塑造成一个卑微的形象。他的财富也被剥夺，他陷入贫困之中。And他与父神之间的爱被剥夺，被抛入孤独。他的喜乐被剥夺，被抛入悲伤；他的力量被剥夺，被抛入软弱。

你们明白道成肉身的暴力吗？神成为人。**这意味着什么？他曾是一颗细胞。**

你知道，我们每次说他是圣灵怀胎而生时都在承认这一点。神成为了宇宙中最脆弱的生命形式。这是一种易受伤害的形式，一个细胞。然后他成了婴儿。

他的手是无助地挥动着的小手，你看，现在无能为力。全能的宇宙主宰在弄脏自己后必须被改变。他无法自我改变。道成肉身的暴力使他沉沦。

他来就是为了沉沦。他不只是从天堂降到地上——腓立比书第二章告诉我们，他走了两步。他不只是从天上来到人间。

## 从摇篮到十字架 / From Cradle to Cross

But once he got here, he went from the cradle to the cross. His role, his job here on earth, was not to become the head of a great political party and sweep into power. His job was to be tortured and to be killed.

The one who knit us together in our mother's womb was deconstructed on the cross and he was torn limb from limb. He sunk. You know, Jesus Christ is the most blatant and the most blunt and the greatest contradiction to the world's understanding of greatness that there is.

The world's understanding is promote yourself, advance your cause at the expense of other people. A crew, the wealth and power. Look out for number one.

---

但一旦到了这里，他就从摇篮走向了十字架。

他的任务、他的使命是在地球上受苦并被杀戮。在我们母腹中将我们缝合在一起的那位，在十字架上被拆散，他的肢体被撕裂。他沉沦了。你知道吗？

耶稣基督是世上最直接、最坦率、也最伟大的对世界理解伟大性的反证。世界的理解是自我提升，不惜牺牲他人来促进自己的事业。追求财富和权力。只顾自己。

## 上升之路在于下降 / The Way Up Is Down

And Jesus, ascended by descending the way up, he taught us is the way down. The way to power, he taught us is to serve. The way to rule is to submit.

The way to lose your life, to find your life is to lose your life. The way to find your happiness is not to seek your happiness, but to seek the happiness of others. And you know what a Christian is?

A Christian is somebody who, in absolute contradiction to all the world's wisdom, decides to follow that as the pattern for your own life. Before we move on, I just want you to think about that for a second. If you're a Christian and a servant, of course, is not greater than his master, then you're a servant of the great servant, obviously, it means that you have also decided the way up for me is down.

Have you decided that? Have you decided that the essence of my life is to sink? Let me just give you a couple of examples of what it means to be a Christian.

For example, the very first step, the very first action a Christian takes as a Christian. In other words, conversion itself. The very first thing you can do to even become a Christian is you rise up to God by going down in repentance.

You will not go up unless you go down. Well, let me put it as stark as possible. I know there's some of you here.

I know who would like to say, yes, I make mistakes, I'm not perfect, but can you say to other people and to God that I am a helpless sinner, that I should be cast off, that I'm acting, even though I've been created by God, I act as if on my own creator, and even though God is my king, I act as if on my own king, I deserve to be cut off. I am a helpless sinner, I need a savior and a new master. Can you say that?

Now, this is New York City, I know there's people out there who think that that is a most primitive thing, the most primitive kind of religion. How regressive you say, of course it's regressive, it's a step down. And if you feel that that's too primitive, and if you couldn't say that, then you're not a servant yet, and your intellectual pride is keeping you from going down and therefore from coming up.

而耶稣通过降卑的方式升到了高位，他教导我们的是谦卑的道路。通往权力的路是服务，统治的路是顺服。失去生命才能找到生命，寻找幸福不是为了寻求自己的幸福，而是为了别人的幸福。你知道一个基督徒是什么吗？

一个基督徒是这样的人：在绝对与世间所有智慧相悖的情况下，他决定以此作为自己人生的模式。在我们继续之前，请大家想一想这一点。如果你是一个基督徒和仆人，当然仆人不应该比他的主人更高贵，那么你就是那位伟大仆人的仆人，显然**这意味着你已经决定了我的道路是向下的。**你们已经做出这个选择了没有？

你们是否已经决定，我生命的本质是要下沉？让我举几个例子来说明什么是基督徒。例如，一个基督徒作为基督徒迈出的第一步、第一行动。换句话说，皈依本身。

成为一个基督徒的最首要的事情就是：通过悔改而向上提升自己。你不会上升除非先下降。让我把话说得更直接一些。我知道在座有些人会说：“是的，我犯过错误，我不是完美的。

” 但你们是否能够对他人和上帝说：“我是无助的罪人，应该被抛弃；即使是我由上帝创造，我也自认为自己是自己的创造者；即使上帝是我的王，我也自认为是自己的国王，我配不上任何东西。我是无助的罪人，需要救主和新的主人。” 能够说出这样的话吗？现在，这是纽约市，在这里有些人可能会认为这种想法是最原始、最落后的宗教观念。

你们会说：“这太倒退了”，当然，这是一个向下的步骤。如果你觉得这太过原始，如果你们不能这样说，那么你们还没有成为仆人，而是在自己的智力优越感中阻止自己下降，从而无法上升。

## 在生活标准上降卑 / Going Down in Living Standards

I'm going to give you another example, to be a Christian, you go down to repentance constantly. To be a Christian also, you go down in your living standards, let me get real practical about this. The Bible says, look at Jesus, though he was rich, he became poor, that through his poverty might become rich.

The Bible continually says that a Christian is someone who looks out there at all kinds of needs, you see needy people, you see all sorts of important causes, you see the work of a church, you see ministries that are helping people in word indeed, and before you become a Christian, before you understand this principle, before this spirit of servitude, this mind that was in Christ Jesus passes into you, you only give what you can afford. Now you know how you define the word afford? What you mean is, I can only give, as long as my giving does not lower the actual standards of living in my life, in other words, I can give as long as it doesn't make me go down, as long as it doesn't actually have an impact on where I can go this summer, as long as it doesn't have an impact on how many options I have to go out to eat tonight, as long as it doesn't change my living standard.

But that's not what Jesus did, Jesus living standards were changed fairly drastically. And when you become a Christian, you realize that you have to give sacrificial, which means, oh, let me put it this way, do you give your money away to people and to causes so generously that your living standard is going down? If not, you're not a servant yet, and your love of comfort is keeping you from going down and therefore rising up.

You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace.

Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. That's your copy today at gospelandlife.comslashgive that's gospelandlife.comslashgive.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Let me give you one more example.

If Philippians 2 were told he made himself of no reputation, a person before you become a Christian, before the spirit of servanthood, before you understand the principle of the way down is up, the way up is to go down. And help people, as long as you get thanks, as long as you get affirmation, as long as you get some recognition, as long as you get some paths on the back, fine. This is how you tell the difference between a person who is serving out of selfishness and a real servant who's not in it for a payoff.

You make yourself of no reputation. You're not in it for the thanks you get, only put it to this way. You need a lot of thanks, do you need, are you always having your nose been out of shape because you feel taken for granted and you feel that people aren't recognizing what you're putting in and nobody seems to know how hard you work.

I work my fingers to the bone around this church and what thanks do I get. If that's how you feel, you're not a servant yet and your need for approval is keeping you from moving down so that you can come up. You see, what God says is, lose your money and I'll give you another kind of riches.

Lose your recognition and I'll give you another kind of honor. Lose your obsession with staying in control and I'll give you another kind of security. Lose your life and you'll find it.

He came to sink and Christians are people who know that the way down is up and the way to go up is to go down.

我再举一个例子：成为一个基督徒意味着不断悔改；成为一个基督徒还意味着降低生活标准。让我们具体一点来说。

圣经上说：“虽然耶稣富有，他却变贫穷了，为的是使我们因他的贫穷可以成为富足。” 圣经不断地告诉我们，基督徒是那些看到各种需要的人。你看到了有需要的人，看到了各种重要的事业，看到了教会的工作，看到了帮助人的事工。在你成为基督徒之前，在你明白这个原则之前，在基督耶稣里的这种服侍的精神和心态进入你之前，你只会给予你能负担的。

现在你知道什么是“负担得起”吗？你的意思是说，只要我的捐赠不会降低我生活的实际标准，我就能够捐出钱来。换句话说，只要它不让我下降，只要它不影响我这个夏天能去哪些地方，只要它不影响我现在晚上出去吃饭有多少选择，只要它不改变我的生活水平。但耶稣不是这样做的。

耶稣的生活标准发生了相当大的变化。当你成为基督徒时，你意识到你需要慷慨地给予，**这意味着，让我这样说吧：你是否把钱慷慨地捐给那些人和事业，以至于你的生活标准下降了？如果没有，你还不是一个仆人，是你对舒适生活的爱阻止了你下降，从而阻碍了你上升。**你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是关于一个离家出走的弟弟。

事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是想向那些远离上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得他爱的人说话。在《浪子的神》一书中，提摩太·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心——一个对叛逆的弟弟和苛责的大哥都有希望的信息，并邀请所有人体验上帝无尽、慷慨的恩典。无论你是基督徒，还是仍在探索信仰，慈爱的天父都会帮助你以全新的视角看待与基督的关系。慈爱的天父是我们本月向福音和生命分享耶稣宽厚而不懈之爱的信息和喜悦的礼物。

这就是今天你的赠礼，请访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取。现在，让我们听听凯勒博士今天的教导。我再给你举一个例子。腓立比书2章提到，一个人在成为基督徒之前，在谦卑服侍的精神之前，在理解“下才是上”的原则之前，他可能会这样表现：只要得到感谢，只要获得肯定，只要有人认可你的付出，只要有人注意到你所做的一切，就很好。

这是区分一个出于自私动机服务的人和真正不图回报的仆人之间的差异。你要甘愿失去名誉。你不为别人的感谢而活着，只是说你需要很多感谢吗？你是否总是因为觉得自己被忽视、没有得到应有的认可而感到不满？

没有人知道你的辛苦工作？我在教会里辛勤耕耘，得到了什么回报呢？如果你有这种感觉，你还不是仆人，是你对认可的需求阻止了你往下走，从而无法向上。你看，神说：“失去你的财富，我将给你另一种富有。

” 失去名声，我将给你另一种荣耀。失去控制的欲望，我将给你另一种安全感。失去生命，你会找到它。他来是为了受苦。

基督徒知道"下才是上"，要上升就必须下降。

## 他来是为了无故被恨 / He Came to Be Hated Without Cause

Secondly, he came to be hated. Now, remember, as I mentioned to you, he quotes in the New Testament, he quotes this verse.

He doesn't quote the first couple of verses though. It's obvious that he's looking at all of this and he's thinking of himself. This is his language, this is his heart, but he quotes verse 4 where it says, those who hate me without reason out in number the hairs of my head, many of the enemies without cause.

I'm going to be real brief on this when I warned you, but it's very important. Jesus in the New Testament points out the fact that people automatically will hate him without reason. They'll hate him irrationally because he's holy.

There is something in the human heart that is afraid of real holiness. We know, when I was some years ago, a movie that came out casually as a war and it was about a man who decides to tell the truth about what happened out in Vietnam, even though it was going to jeopardize his life, even though it was going to ruin his career, even though it was going to make have a tremendous impact on his life and he did it anyway. And the movie reviewer here in New York Times, Vincent Canbey, points out this.

He says, such selfless moral conviction always makes a person a pariah because such purity of spirit is totally frightening to us. What he means is we have got in our hearts an engine of self-justification and the way we continually convince ourselves that we're okay is that when we get near a standard of godliness that shows up our own flaws, we either run from it or we run it down. We either run it down or run away.

That's true of anything, anyone who's living a straight life, living a servant life. Now when Jesus shows up, his standard is so lofty and so high that they hate him without cause. He has not enemies without number, but I tell you that if you and I are going to follow Jesus and if you and I are going to be servants, that's always the mark of a servant.

A servant will always be hated without a cause. He'll be a couple of examples. A friend of mine who years ago was a cop, a policeman in a large city in the United States.

He became a Christian. He had trouble with something and that is that the pimps in the precinct would come in and give a lot of money to the sergeant who would pass it out to all the officers so that they would not pick up the prostitutes that put money in the pool. After my friend became a Christian, he decided he didn't want to take that money and at one point a guy comes up to him and says, hey, you better start taking that money.

These don't like the fact that you seem to think you're more pure than the rest of us and you better take that money or the next time you need to back up, it might come slowly. I remember talking to a family when I was living in Philadelphia and when the very first black family moved into their white neighborhood. They went over as Christians, as friends took them some pies and greeted them and afterwards they were absolutely vilified and attacked by the other white families in that neighborhood and they said, my house is the only thing I've got.

If those people start coming in, it's going to sink down, you're going to ruin me. How can you do this to me? A man once came to me and said after he became a Christian, if I start to report my income truly and start to pay the taxes, I really owe all my other co-workers are going to be nailed by the IRS as well.

What do I do? All I can tell you is not what these people did, but I can tell you is this, normal servanthood, normal, moral lives will bring you hatred without cause. Normal human living, normal moral behavior, normal Christian living is going to show up the racism in the neighborhood, it's going to show up the dishonesty at work, it's going to show up the gossip at the office, it's going to show up the promiscuity of the party and you will be hated with that cause, are you or you just blend into your surroundings?

Does anybody hate you without cause? Then you're not following Jesus because servants sink and servants are hated with that cause.

---

其次，他来是为了被憎恨。记得我之前提到过，在新约中，他引用了这一节经文。他并没有引用前几节经文。

很明显，他在看这一切时，想到的是自己。这是他的语言，这是他的心声，但他引用了第4节：“恨我的人比我头发的数目还多。”“许多没有理由恨我的仇敌。” 我刚才说过要简短，但这一点非常重要。

在新约中，耶稣指出人们会无故地恨他。他们会出于非理性的原因恨他，因为他圣洁。人类心中有一种害怕真正圣洁的东西。几年前，有一部关于越南战争的电影上映了，讲述一个男人决定说出真相，即使这会危及他的生命、毁掉他的职业生涯，甚至会对他的生活产生巨大影响，但他还是坚持了下来。

《纽约时报》的影评人文森特·卡贝指出这一点。他说：“无私的道德信念总是让一个人成为众矢之的，因为这种纯洁的精神对我们来说是完全可怕的。”他所说的正是我们心中有一种自我辩护的引擎，当我们接近一个表明自身缺点的神圣标准时，我们会逃避它或贬低它。我们会逃避它，或者贬低它。

这不仅适用于任何人，任何过着正直生活、仆人般生活的人。现在当耶稣出现时，他的标准如此高，以至于人们无故地恨他。他没有无数的敌人，但我要告诉你，如果你和我想要跟随耶稣，如果你和我想要成为仆人，这就是仆人的标志。一个仆人总是会无故被憎恨。

这里有几个例子。几年前，我的一位朋友在美国的一个大城市当警察。他成了基督徒。他在某方面遇到了麻烦，那就是辖区里的鸨母会进来给警长很多钱，然后警长再分发给所有警察，这样他们就不会抓那些把钱放进池子里的妓女了。

我的朋友成为基督徒后，决定不再接受这笔钱。有一天，有人来找他说：“你最好开始收这个钱。” 这些人不喜欢他似乎认为自己比其他人更纯洁，并且告诉他如果继续不收钱，下次需要支援时可能会得不到帮助。我记得我在费城生活时与一个家庭交谈的情景。

当第一个黑人家庭搬进那个白人社区时，他们作为基督徒前去拜访，带去了馅饼并友好地迎接了他们。但之后，其他白人邻居却对他们进行了无端的攻击和诋毁，并说：“我唯一的家就是我的房子，如果这些人开始进来，我的房子就会被破坏，你会毁了我的生活。” 你怎么能这样对我？后来有人来找我说，他成为基督徒后，如果如实申报收入并开始缴税，他的其他同事也会因为税务问题受到牵连。

我只能告诉你，不是这些人的所作所为如何，我可以告诉你的是，正常的服侍、正常道德的生活会带来无端的仇恨。正常的日常生活、正常的道德行为、正常的基督徒生活会揭露社区中的种族主义、工作场所的不诚实、办公室里的流言蜚语以及聚会中的放纵，你会因此受到无端的憎恨，而不是融入周围的环境。有没有人因为无端的原因而恨你？那你就不是在跟随耶稣，因为仆人就是沉下去，并且因这种原因被憎恨。

## 他来是为了替代受苦 / He Came to Be Exchanged

Number three, and the most important, Jesus Christ did not simply come to be a servant and come to be hated in a sense, that's the general gist of what it means to say he came as a servant, but he came very specifically to be exchanged.

They put it to this way, in verse nine, now David, the guy who writes this song is very perplexed. He can't see what we can see, he can't read his own experience through Jesus. In verse nine, he says, Zeal for your house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.

Now David is perplexed. He says, like I mentioned in verse 17, he says, How can you let your servant, how can you hide your face from your servant? I'm doing everything right, I'm being an exemplary servant, I'm loving you, I'm true to you.

Zeal for your house, for your cause consumes me. Why in the world are you letting me suffer innocently? Or let me put it this way, he says, Zeal for your house consumes me.

And then he says the insults, the people insult you fall on me. That which I do not deserve is falling on me. How could it be, says David?

Jesus says, That's what I came to do. But that which I did not deserve fell on me. Isaiah talks about the suffering servant in these terms.

He simply says in Isaiah 52 and 53, See my servant will act wisely, Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer. And though the Lord makes him like his life a guilt offering, The results of his suffering he will see and he shall be satisfied. Listen with me for a second.

Think with me. This is the doctrine of substitution. Whenever I ask one of my sons to pick up something, You know, this is a mess in here, pick it up.

If it so happened that my son was guilty of making the mess, He will reluctantly usually get up and start doing it slowly. But if, well, one to me, If I ask one particular son to pick up the mess that has actually been caused by the failures and sins of some other son. In that situation, The son will say, that's not my fault.

Why should I take the hit for the failing of another? Why should I suffer in a substitutionary way for the fault failings in the sins of someone else? Let's pick this up.

This is an instinct. This is exactly what your heart say. Ah, someone says, you know, for whatever reason, Because of all sorts of failures, Failures on the part of the person, Failures on the part of his family, Failures on the part of the system, Failures on the part of the city, We now have a great need for lots of drug rehabilitation centers.

We need homeless rehabilitation centers. We need to put them in your neighborhood and what's the attitude? What's the attitude?

Why should I take the hit for the sins of someone else? Why should I suffer substitutionally for the failings of someone else? That's the instinct.

That's how we always feel. But that's not how a servant's heart operates. Let me tell you how a servant's heart operates.

The servant says, I know this isn't my fault. But somebody's got to take the hit. And somebody's going to have to pay the price.

And so I will do it. I will take the hit. I will pay the price.

I will substitutionally suffer. Now, do you understand why Jesus was the greatest servant of all? Because he just didn't do a little.

He took the hit for the sins of the world. He suffered substitutionally for the sins of everyone. And that is what's being depicted here.

He took the biggest hit. He took the greatest weight. He took on himself the most incredible debt.

That's why when he reads those words, father, why have you hidden your face from your servant? He knows the answer. Because when he was on the cross and he was saying, why have you hidden your face from your servant?

Why? My God have you forsaken me. As God the Father turned away from him.

The Father said, son, you know why I have to do this to you. Because we agreed to do this from all eternity. No, why am I hiding my face from you?

Because it's got to fall on you. It will all fall on you. In your mind's eye, look at him.

And then read Psalm 69. Look at him up there. Blood coming down his face.

His eyes swollen shut because he's been beaten. His back is ripped open because of the scourging. He's suffocating up on the cross and then read.

I looked for sympathy, but there was none. I looked for comforters and I found none. My heart is breaking and there's nobody to bind it up.

It fell on him. Don't you see some of you out there. Listen, this is some of you who've done some terrible things.

But don't you see there's hope for anybody. There may be people out here. This is New York City.

Maybe people out here who have murdered people. There's people out here who've done some terrible things and you hate yourselves. And at some deep level, you're saying nothing can help me.

I deserve to be spit upon. I deserve to be beaten. I deserve to be condemned.

Do you see? Do you finally see? It fell on him.

In other words, if you believe in Jesus Christ, you've already been beaten. You're right, but you've already been beaten. You're right, but you've already been spit upon.

You're right, but you've already been condemned. And there's plenty of you that haven't done anything that awful. And don't you see what's going on in your lives?

Look at yourselves. Why are you working so hard? Why are you working so desperately hard?

Why is there this franticness about your life trying to prove yourself? Or why is there all this grumpiness and irritability about your life trying to defend yourself? Don't you see?

Stop it! It's been paid. Stop trying to pay for it.

It fell on you. Lord Jesus, say that. It fell on you, Lord Jesus, for me.

Let's conclude this way. Don't you see what's so wonderful about the teaching of the Bible? Jesus Christ did not come only as God-servant.

No, he didn't come only as a model of what it means to serve God. If that's all he was, oh, we'd be in such trouble. We'd look at him and he'd be mad at him.

We'd run from him. We'd hate him without cause. But instead, he sunk for me.

And you, he sunk for us. He was hated for us. He was exchanged for us.

He comes to actually serve and wait on us. It says in Luke, Jesus tells this parable about himself. And he says in the book of Luke, blessed are those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes.

He will gird himself to serve and will come and wait on them. Do you know what that means? On the last day, if he finds you serving him, on the last day, he's going to gird himself.

The gird means to pick up your robes and stick them in your belt so that you can concentrate. He's going to gird himself. He's going to pull up all the infinities and immensities of his infinite omnipotent power and he's going to bring them all to bear to serve you, to heal you, to love you, to satisfy you, to honor you.

Blessed will those servants be. Are you ready for that day? If tomorrow's that day, would you be one of those servants?

Don't forget to be a real servant. Isn't somebody who's trying to save him or herself by your service? Because the first act of a real servant is to say, because only love me and accept me because it fell on you.

I'm a sinner. I can't save myself through my serving. The first act of service is to say accept me because, O Lord Jesus, it all fell on you.

The bread and the cup. When you get the bread, it's going to be broken. And as you eat it, you'll break it more.

Listen to what it says. It says, Do you know why I was broken? Do you know why I was forsaken?

Do you know why my father hid his face so it could fall on me for you? Let's pray. Father, we ask as we take the bread and the cup that we might go down to come up.

We pray that we might learn what it means that your sons die for us and suffered for us. And the more we think about this is we take the bread and cup, make us servants as well. Men and women who will go down in their bank accounts, go down in recognition, go down in the status and eyes of the world, go down in repentance, but who will find a new kind of honor, a new kind of riches, a new kind of joy.

Father, as we take the bread and cup, do all that in us. We pray in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for joining us here on The Gospel and Life Podcast.

第三点，也是最重要的一点，耶稣基督不仅仅来成为仆人并受到憎恨，虽然作为仆人的含义正是如此，但他非常具体地是来交换的。他们这样写道，在第九节，大卫——写下这首诗的那个人非常困惑。他看不到我们所看到的东西，无法通过耶稣来解读自己的经历。在第九节中，他说：“我为你的殿心里焦急，如同火烧，并且辱骂你的，就落在我身上。

” 现在大卫很困惑。正如我在第17节提到的，他说：“你为何容这悖逆的国民立定？你为何以这些人遮蔽自己？”“我虽然做父亲的事，与你亲近，你为什么从我面前推辞呢？

你仆人仰望你，直到得着佳美之地。” 他为你的殿、为你所行的事热心。为什么你要让我无辜受苦？或者说，他说：“我为你的殿心里焦急。

”然后他又说，“辱骂你的，就落在我身上。我不该承受的责备都落在了我身上。”大卫问道。耶稣说：“这就是我要做的。

”但那不该由我承担的责备却落到了我的头上。以赛亚也用这种方式谈论受苦的仆人。他在以赛亚书52和53章中简单地说道：“看哪，我的仆人必因智慧而被高举，也被高抬、大大升高。”“因为耶和华使他有灵的感动，他必看见后裔，并且延长年日，耶和华所喜悦的事在他手中必成全。

他必看见自己劳苦的结果，便心满意足。” 听我说一下。想想看。这就是代赎的教义。

每当我要我的儿子收拾东西时，你知道这里很乱，你去收拾吧。如果恰好是我的儿子弄脏了这个地方，他会不情愿地慢慢开始收拾。但如果，比如说，我让一个特定的儿子收拾另一个儿子造成的混乱，这个儿子会说：“这跟我有什么关系？”“为什么我要替别人的过错受罚？

为什么我要以代赎的方式承受他人的罪过？”让我们继续探讨这一主题。这是本能。这就是你内心的声音。

有人曾说，由于种种原因，无论是个人的失败，家庭的失败，制度的失败，城市的失败，我们现在迫切需要许多戒毒中心。**我们需要无家可归者的康复中心，并且要设在你们的社区里。**那态度是什么样的？为什么要为别人的罪受罚？

为什么要替别人的行为付出代价？这就是本能。这是我们总是有的感觉。但仆人的心不会这样运作。

让我告诉你仆人的心是如何运作的。仆人说，我知道这不是我的错。但是有人必须承担责任。有人必须付出代价。

所以我来承担吧。我将替他受罚。我将付出代价。我将替他受苦。

现在你们明白为什么耶稣是最伟大的仆人了吗？因为他不只是做了一点点。他为世人的罪受了责罚，替所有人的过失承受了替代性的痛苦。这就是这里所描绘的。

他承担了最大的责任。他背负了最沉重的负担。他为自己承担了最不可思议的债务。所以他读到那些话时，父亲，为什么你离弃你的仆人？

他知道答案。因为在十字架上他说，为什么你离弃你的仆人？为什么？我的神，你为何离弃我？

正如神父离开了他。天父说，儿子，你知道我为什么要这样做。因为我们从永恒就达成了这个协议。不，为什么我要离弃你？

因为我必须让你承担这一切。所有的一切都必须由你来承担。在你的脑海中想象一下他。然后读诗篇69篇。

看看他上面的样子。鲜血流下他的脸庞。他的眼睛肿得闭不上，因为他被打过。他的背部被鞭打撕裂开来。

他在十字架上窒息，然后继续读： 我寻求怜悯，却无一人同情；我寻求安慰，却无人安慰。我的心在破碎，却没有谁能医治。它落在他身上了。难道你看不到，你们当中有些人就是这样的吗？

听我说，这可能就是你们中的一些人，做了些可怕的事情。但你有没有看到，每个人都有希望。也许这里有一些人。这里是纽约市。

也许这里有曾经杀过人的家伙。这里有人做了可怕的事情，你们恨自己。在内心深处，你们说没有什么能帮助我了。我配得上被唾弃。

我配得上被打。我配得上被谴责。你明白吗？你终于明白了？

它落在他身上了。换句话说，如果你相信耶稣基督，你已经被鞭打了。没错，但你已经被鞭打了。没错，但你已经被唾弃了。

没错，但你已经被谴责了。而这里有很多人并没有做过那么可怕的事情。你们有没有看到，你们生活中发生了什么？看看自己吧。

为什么这么努力工作？为什么如此拼命地工作？为什么生活里会有这种焦躁不安，试图证明自己？或者为什么会有这么多的烦躁和易怒，试图保护自己？

你明白吗？别再这样了！这一切都已经付出了代价。不要再试图为自己付出这些。

它落在你们身上了。主耶稣，请你说这句话。它落在你身上了，主耶稣，为我。让我们以这种方式结束吧。

你有没有看到圣经教导中多么美妙呢？耶稣基督不仅仅是一个神的仆人来服侍。不，他不仅仅是一个效仿如何服侍神的榜样。如果他是这样，那我们可就麻烦大了。

我们会看着他，而他会对我们生气。我们会逃避他，恨他没有理由地恨他。但相反，他为我们受苦。而你们，他也为我们受苦。

他被憎恶是为了我们。他被交换是为了我们。他来实际上是要服侍和等候我们。路加福音中说，耶稣讲了一个关于自己的比喻，并且在路加福音中说：“有福的是那些仆人，主人进来时发现他们醒着。

”他会束上外衣，服侍他们，等候他们回来。你知道**这意味着什么吗？在最后的一天，如果他发现你们正在服侍他，那么在最后一天，他会束上外衣。**裹就是提起你的袍子束在腰间，以便集中精力。

他要裹上自己。他会调动起他那无穷无尽、无所不能的力量，并将这些力量全部用来服侍你、医治你、爱你、满足你、荣耀你。那些仆人是有福的。那一天你准备好了吗？

如果明天就是那一天，你会是其中的一员吗？不要忘记做一个**真正的仆人。难道有人是**为了通过你的服务来救自己而成为仆人的吗？因为一个真正仆人的第一件事就是说：“接受我吧，因为我落在了你身上。

” 我是罪人，无法通过我的服侍自救。一个真正仆人的第一件事就是说：“接受我吧，哦主耶稣，这一切都落在了你身上。” 饼和杯。当你拿到饼时，它会被折断；当你吃的时候，它会更碎。

听听它怎么说。它说：“你知道我为什么被折断吗？你知道我为什么被人弃绝吗？你知道我的父亲为何掩面，好让我为你受苦？

”让我们祷告。父啊，当我们拿取饼和杯时，求你使我们懂得，你的儿子为了我们而死、为我们受苦的意义。每当我们拿起饼和杯，愿我们成为仆人。愿我们成为那些在银行账户中减少，在世人眼中被忽视，在悔改中下降的人；但愿我们在新的荣耀、新的财富、新的喜乐中找到新的价值。

父啊，当我们拿取饼和杯时，请使这一切发生在我们身上。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。感谢您收听《福音与生命播客》。希望今天的教导能激励你更深入地研读神的话语。
