For many people, they bring up feelings of guilt and shame, or they seem like a list of rules that are impossible to follow. In today's sermon, Tim Keller shows us how God didn't give us the Ten Commandments to crush us with unattainable moral standards, but to point us to Jesus Christ, the only one who perfectly fulfills God's law. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness.

Since what may be known about God is plain to them because God has made it plain to them, for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.

Therefore, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another." Suppressing the truth and suppressing the truth is not admitting there's a God there and the reason that people are suppressing the truth is because, what does it say in verse 21? They won't thank him. The thing that gets this God angry, a God as great as this, a creator God who sifts the stars through his fingers like sand, to whom the Milky Way is a piece of lint.

What gets this great and good being angry? Ingratitude. Now, a question comes up.

Is God being petty? Why would God get angry about ingratitude? It seems like a petty thing.

The answer is, we ourselves take it quite seriously. Listen, for example, what happens if you take, if you're a musician and you take something that was written by somebody else? If you're an author and you take something that was written by somebody else?

If you're a scholar or you're a student and you take something that was written by somebody else and you publish it as if you were the author and therefore you act as an authority, because the word authority comes from the word author, you say, I'm the author of it and therefore I'm an authority. When you publish it as if you're the author, that is illegal. Why?

It's plagiarism. You can be sued into the ground for it and rightly so. And what it is, it's ingratitude.

Because all plagiarism is, is ingratitude. What it is, is saying, instead of saying, I am in debt to someone else, I acknowledge that I am a dependent person. At this point, I am dependent on the work of someone else.

Instead, you set yourself up as the authority and say, no, I'm an independent person and I needed no one's help to write this thing. That's ingratitude. It's plagiarism.

It's illegal. Let me go up to another level. During World War I, when the Germans were fighting against the Americans, if you caught a German prisoner trying to bring down the United States government, because he was a soldier out there and he was fighting on the lines, you see, if you capture him, what did you do with him?

You weren't allowed to torture him, you weren't allowed to execute him. No, according to the international laws, what you had to do was treat him with respect, put him in a prisoner of war camp. However, if you caught an American fighting against you, if you caught an American trying to bring down the United States government, that person could be executed.

Why? Because that's treason. Well, why?

What's the difference? If an American does it and a German does it, the difference is the American is a citizen. The American owes a debt of gratitude to the country, and therefore he should be executed.

Why? That's how all the international laws go. Why?

He should be executed for ingratitude. You can be sued for ingratitude. You can be executed for ingratitude.

Now let's take it up one more level. What is Romans chapter 1 talking about? Are you beginning to get the drift of this?

Though you may believe in God in a general way, do you go through life as your own authority? Even though God created you, even though the Bible says, Hebrews 1.3, he holds the universe together with the word of his power, even though he keeps you together every moment, he keeps your heart pumping, he keeps your molecules from going out in about 10 billion different directions and you vaporizing. Here's this God upholding you every single minute.

He is your author. And yet do you, though in a general way you acknowledge him, that he exists, but do you give him the mastery of your life? Do you give him authority or do you live as your own authority?

Do you submit every part of your life to his will and his word? Your heart, your life. Or do you go about making your own decisions, legislating your own standards?

Do you go about saying, I'm an independent person, I am my own authority? That is cosmic plagiarism. You can be sued for that.

You are being sued for that. When the prophets come in the Bible and they say, thus saith the Lord, they are bringing a lawsuit. Let's pick it up one more step.

If there is a God who created you and therefore since that God gave you everything, you owe that God an eternal debt, an absolute debt. The only due that you can give to a person who has given you everything is everything. Do you work for his agenda?

Do you work for his goals? Do you work for his business? Or do you take all the things he's given you, your mind, your body, your abilities, do you take all those things in a sense he's given you the business charge card and you're going off to the Bahamas with it?

In other words, are you basically living for your own interests? Are you basically living for your own goals? Are you basically doing your own business?

My friends, that is treason. You're saying, I want to be governor of my own life. What's wrong with that?

That's treason. It's cosmic treason. It's ingratitude of the highest order.

And this passage says it's secret treason because the passage says something very, very, very profound. And that is that the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against the wickedness of men who suppress the truth. Since they can see in nature, it says, since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities have been clearly seen in what is created, though they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks, but suppressed the truth.

The reason this is a secret treason is because you keep it secret from yourself. It says that even though you know there is a God, no matter who you are, who created you, that owns you, to whom you owe a debt, we all press that truth down to some degree. We suppress it.

We know we're committing treason, but we keep it secret even from ourselves, and yet we know it. That's what's so weird about this passage. It says they knew God, and yet it says they suppress it, they know God.

So you know it and you don't know it. You know that there's a debt of absolute seriousness and joy that you owe to a creator God and yet you don't know it. And I think any psychologist will tell you things that you sort of know, that you hold down, but you don't know, but you do know, are unhealthy.

And they can run your life. And this profound passage is actually doing a deep kind of therapy on us. This passage is saying, come to grips with what you know to be true about yourself or it's going to always, always keep you bound in shallows and misery and confusion.

And so the passage says, let's look at the structure of this repression. Let's look at the structure of this secret treason that's operating in every person's life. And the structure is right here.

Let me just outline it for you, then we'll go through it. The outline is very interesting. First of all it says, ingratitude leads to repression.

See it says they suppress the truth because they're ungrateful. Ingratitude leads to repression, let's say. And then we're told repression leads to darkness.

It says in verse 21, because they refuse to thank him, it says their thinking becomes futile and their minds become darkened. Ingratitude leads to repression, repression leads to darkness, and then darkness leads to every one of this. This darkness leads to all of the problems in your life, all your behavioral problems, all your bad habits, all of your sins.

Ingratitude leads to repression, repression leads to darkness, and darkness leads to all the sin problems that we've got. And the only answer, this passage tells us, is to exchange the lie for the truth of who God is to us and the debt we owe him, exchange the lie for the truth of gratitude. And when you take that truth and put it back in the center of your life, joy explodes again.

Now that's what the passage says, but let's break it down. Let's go back to each of those steps. Number one, all right, number one.

It says here, ingratitude leads to repression. You see this word for at the beginning of verse 21, it says for. The reason they repress and suppress the truth, even though they look out into nature and there's a creator God obvious, Paul says, because they don't want to glorify him as God or give thanks to him, they hold down the truth.

That's very important. It's one thing to say, I agree that there's a God. It's another thing to let him be glorified as God.

Let him be God in your life. You see, to glorify in the Bible literally means to give weight to something. What Paul says is not that people want to deny that there is a God, but they want to deny who that God really is to them.

They want to, they want to deny God, they want to deny God's being God. They don't want to take him without a complete seriousness. They don't, they want, they want to be their own masters.

They want to call their own shots. And when they look out and they see there's a God behind the universe, they don't draw the logical implication of that. If there's a God behind the universe, then I shouldn't be my own authority.

I should give him the mastery. Now, Paul, by the way, here in verse 20, when Paul says, for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities of eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse. He's using an old and very unanswerable argument for the existence of God.

He says, look out there. Look at the design. Look at nature.

Look at the design. What he's really, he's using this old argument. He says, imagine, in a sense, he says, imagine an explosion in a paint factory creating the Mona Lisa.

By accident, of course, but you know, everything goes up and down it comes and it just happens to fall on the canvas in such a way that it paints this lovely picture. What are the chances of that? Well, you say there's no chance of that.

And of course, any mathematician will tell you that's not true. You could never say there's no chance of that. Of course, there's an infinitesimal chance of that sort of thing happening.

But Paul is saying there's a far greater chance of that happening than the idea of all of this order and all of this design and all of this beauty happening by accident. And yet, he says, what's amazing is that there's many people who will bet their whole lives on that chance. Whenever I've used the argument on people, whenever I've said, what are the chances of all this happening by accident?

They say, well, that doesn't prove God. No, it doesn't. It doesn't prove that the Mona Lisa couldn't be painted by an explosion in a paint factory.

But what kind of fool would bet your life on that? And what Paul is saying is anybody who does shows a bias. Paul says, if you really are that, if you're that willing to suppress the truth, it shows a bias.

You know, Freud, Marx, Feuerbach, and Nietzsche all said that Christians need God. They've got psychological needs for God. You see this, and they all had different approaches, of course, to it.

And Marx said the rich needed God to keep the poor down. And of course, Sigmund Freud said people needed God because they need to have a deity to whom they can atone for their rebellion against authority figures. And Nietzsche had his own view, and Ludwig Feuerbach, and they all said there's psychological reasons why people need to believe in God.

And by the way, that's true. What Paul's pointing out here is there's far greater and deeper psychological reasons for people to disbelieve in God. Because you see, even though we look out there and we say, yeah, obviously there must be a God, but if there is a personal God who created all this design, then we would owe him authority.

There's no in-between. Either there's no God and all this is an accident, or there is a God and we owe him everything. We don't want that.

And so you see, Paul says there's very deep psychological reasons to deny God. And that makes sense to me, because over the years, when I've talked to folks, when you just share in a nutshell what the Christian message is, it goes like this. The Christian message goes like this.

God created you, and even though you lived your whole life as your own authority, making your own decisions, you see, and legislating your own morality, setting your own goals, God loves you still, and he's entered into your situation, and he's come down into history in the person of Jesus Christ, and he took the punishment that you are in gratitude deserved so that we can enter into an unending love relationship with our Creator and have a life dominated by joy and grateful love. That's the message. And, you know, the rational approach, if you were going to reject that, would be to say, I can't accept that because it's too good to be true.

Oh, how great it would be if it was. That's not what the response has been to me over the years. The response has been, there you go, trying to tell me what to do with my life.

And that shows, I'd say, a deep bias. That's what Paul says. Here's people who are willing to bet their lives on a fairly slim chance.

Ingratitude leads to repression, but then it goes further. Repression leads to darkness. It says here, verse 21, since they would not give thanks to him, their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.

Now, the word futile means pointless. It means not being able to see the purpose in something. And that is the truth.

What Paul is saying here is if you reject the personal God because you don't want to give him mastery over your life, you're put in this terrible position. If there's no personal God, there's no right and wrong, there's no moral structure to things, no moral structure to things, and you are left with darkness. We all chase things like success, true love, or the perfect life, good things that can easily become ultimate things.

When we put our faith in them, deep down, we know they can't satisfy our deepest longings. The truth is that we've made lesser gods of good things, things that can't give us what we really need. In his book Counterfeit Gods, The Empty Promises of Money, Sex, and Power and the Only Hope That Matters, Tim Keller shows us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the truth about societal ideals and our own hearts, and shows us that there is only one God who can wholly satisfy our desires.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. Let me give you three case studies.

One is a little hard to give because you're not allowed to give away a movie, but Woody Allen's new movie, Crimes and Misdemeanors, basically the plot goes like this. There's a man who's a moral man, but not a religious man. He's a moral man with a conscience, but he doesn't really have much in the way of a religious basis for it.

He's moving along through life all right until he has a small affair with a stewardess, and the stewardess looks like she's going to tell on him to try to get his wife to leave him. And he's in this position, this man's stuck. His life may come down around his ears, and he begins to contemplate what somebody suggests to him as the way out, and that is that he have this woman murdered.

He goes to a rabbi, and the rabbi says, well, there must be a moral structure in the universe. If there wasn't, there would be no meaning to things, there'd be no way to live. And so what you have to do is do the right thing.

I can't go any further. I can't give away the movie. It's wrong, right?

But I'll tell you this. The message of the movie, oh, it doesn't end with a good resolution. It leaves it in the air like the book of Ecclesiastes does.

The message of the movie is there's no way to know that there's a moral structure to the universe, but there has to be one. There's no way to know, but there's got to be one, and we're stuck. Because see, morality without religion doesn't work.

A moral structure without a personal creator doesn't work, that we know doesn't work. Let me give you a case study. A few years ago, if you remember, there was a whole rash of these mini-series and movies on nuclear holocaust.

Remember the day after was a mini-series. But then there was a couple of, and that wasn't a terribly good mini-series, but there were a number of other good movies about that time. And everybody began writing and said, wouldn't it be awful if civilization was destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe?

Wouldn't that be terrible? I read about that time an essay that floored me, and I want to share it with you. What this man said in the essay was, to even suggest that it would be awful for a nuclear catastrophe to end civilization assumes the existence of a personal God.

And he says, since most educated people either disbelieve in God or at least believe that there's no way to know if there's a God, and therefore, since most educated people believe that the only thing that you can be sure is here is nature, Paul says in verse 20, behind nature there's a personal God, but this man was saying, since most educated people know that there's nothing really but nature, he says, what difference does it make if civilization ends today or about a billion years from now? Because in relationship to the oceans of dead time before civilization and after civilization, it's insignificant whether our civilization goes another thousand years or another million years because civilization will be an infinitesimal, insignificant, accidental flicker in the eons of time. No one will even be around to even understand or remember it.

So he says, who cares? To even say it's awful that civilization might end on the basis of a nuclear holocaust assumes and presumes that there's a personal creator God. That's what he said.

And he says, if you don't know that, there's no reason to wring your hands over it. And you know what? I don't know how you feel about that, but if you say, I don't know, maybe some of you are saying, I don't know if there's a creator God, but I reject that argument.

You're fighting against the darkness. Because what Paul says is, if you suppress the idea of a creator God, you're left with the darkness that that essay tells you about. There's no in between, either there's a creator God to whom you owe everything and mastery of your life and authority, or there's darkness.

In fact, I'll give you a third case study. C. S.

Lewis, who was a Christian, but he was writing an essay once trying to point out to people, if there's nothing but nature, if there's no creator God, if there's no supernatural reality, if there's nothing but nature, what does it mean to fall in love? And he says, pretty interestingly, he says, you can't, except in the lowest animal sense, be in love with a girl if you know, and keep on remembering, that all the beauties, both of her person and of her character, are a momentary and accidental pattern produced by a collision of atoms. And that your own response to them is only a kind of psychic phosphorescence arising from the behavior of your chromosomes.

You can't get serious pleasure from music, either. And now this gets worse, all right? You can't get serious pleasure from music, either, if you know and remember that its air of significance is a pure illusion, and that you like it only because your nervous system is irrationally conditioned to like it.

You may still, in the lowest sense, begin to have a good time, but just insofar as it ever threatens to push you on from cold sensuality into real warmth and real joy, so far you will be forced to feel the hopeless disharmony between your own emotions and the universe that you believe you really live in. Now down deep, you start to say, no, that's not the way things are. Listen, you're fighting against the darkness.

Either there's a personal creator God to whom you owe a debt of gratitude, which means everything. You owe that God everything, and authority in your life. Or there's darkness, and what Lewis says is right, and what that man said about nuclear destruction is right.

Ingratitude leads to repression, repression leads to darkness, and darkness leads to every other problem. Because you see, in verse 24 and 25, it says something very weird, I think. It says, after it says that their hearts were darkened because of ingratitude, first it says they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images and they worshiped idols.

Then it says down in verse 24, God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity. Now how in the world could all cultic religions and all sorts of moral distortion come from ingratitude? That's what the Bible says.

That's what Paul says. And rather than try to go into any esoteric, any more esoteric intellectual arguments, let me finally get down to the nitty gritty. You can see it in your own life.

Ingratitude is the mother of self-pity. You see, the only way to get rid of self-pity is gratitude. If you sit around saying, I deserve a better life than this, things haven't been fair, I shouldn't be treated like this, nothing is going right.

That's ingratitude, that's self-pity, and that is the mother of almost every immorality that you do. Because it enables you first to do little evils and then later on bigger evils. When I have done ministry in prisons, and even though there are a lot of fine folks in the prisons, there's an awful lot of incredibly cruel, harsh people there too.

And almost all of them justify what they've done. Well, I know I raped her because she was like this. I stole because that's the way that those people always have treated me.

And you see, the ingratitude leads to the self-pity, leads to the bitterness, and it leads to prison. But even if you're not in the real prison, self-pity is a prison. And everything comes from that ingratitude.

On the other hand, if you get up in a day and you stand on the Christian platform, and the Christian platform is this, I have a creator God who created me, I owe him everything, I've never even begun to repay him for what he's done for me, and therefore, never on any day have I ever gotten what I deserve. I've only gotten better than I deserve. And because of that, everything I receive today is the mercy of God.

On the basis of that, your life becomes a mainspring of grateful joy. You see, here's the answer to the whole problem. This terrible secret that goes down and down and down and down, ingratitude leads to repression, repression leads to darkness, darkness leads to self-pity, and all sorts of evil behaviors that kill your own conscience, you go against what you know is right.

The only answer, it says here, the secret treason comes, it says, from exchanging the truth of God for a lie, well, then the only answer is to exchange the lie for the truth. The lie is this, I am my own person, I'm an independent person, I need no one else and I don't need God, that's the lie. The truth is, I owe God everything, I need him, where is he?

And friends, if you make that the center of your life, the joy begins to run through your life like lightning. You see, the mainspring of the Christian life is gratitude, I mean it's the mainspring. In fact, the way you can tell the difference between a real Christian and a just generally religious person is whether or not gratitude is the mainspring of your life.

Listen, many times I've talked to folks who sense a need for God and so they say, I know I've got an emptiness in my life, I need God, I need God. So they come and they say, to me very often, I'm a pastor and they may come and ask, they may say, what do I do, do I go to church, read the Bible, clean my life up, I'm ready, but I don't know whether I'm connecting with God or not. Now the problem with that, even though they feel that need, they're being driven by selfishness and they're even being driven by fear.

They're afraid that God's going to reject them, they're afraid they're going to miss out on something, and so they do everything they can to clean their lives up and then they say, okay, I've given myself to God now, and so now I really, really want him to be working in my life, and the way you can tell whether you're that kind of manipulator is as soon as bad things come into your life, you get ready to kick God out. What good is this? I started coming to church, and now look, some of you might be in that mode right now.

Some of you might have come today because you're in that mode. You're beginning to sense an emptiness, you're beginning to feel something more you need, you're saying, well, what do I have to do, what do I have to do, and you're driven by need and a little bit by fear. That's not what makes a Christian life go.

A Christian life goes like this. The difference between a manipulator and a servant is a servant thinks like this. Now listen.

A servant says, yes, I need God, yes, I need God, yes, things are going to go bad for me if I don't find God, but before I need God, I owe God. I owe him my life, I owe him my love, regardless of what he does for me from here on in. I owe God, and I see that he has given me everything I need in Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ came and lived and died for me, and I can receive, the message of the gospel is I can receive my salvation, my deliverance, my acceptance with God completely as a free gift, and because I see that, now I can live a life of gratitude. And listen, a life of gratitude is a weird thing. When somebody does something marvelous for you, you feel a sense of obligation.

It's real obligation. It's not voluntary. You say, I owe you.

So it's a sense of obligation. You feel bound. It's not voluntary, and yet it's not slavery either.

It's love. It's love. It's driven by love, not fear.

That's what it means to live a life of gratitude. Now there's two kinds of people in this room. Let me conclude this way, and I don't really know who you are, and I'm certainly not trying to ferret you out.

In fact, you better not look at anybody else in the room because it's impossible to work this out. It's hard enough to work it out on yourself. It's hard enough to figure out which side of the line you are.

Don't worry about anybody else. On the one hand, we've got people in the room who receive Christ as their Lord and Savior, and therefore, they understand that salvation is a free gift, and the mainspring of their life is gratitude. And yet, the fact is that you are full of problems.

I say to you, work thankfulness into the warp and woof of your life. For example, do you get worried? Are you worried this week?

Philippians 4 says, have no anxiety about anything, but rather give thanks. And you know what that means? It means are you able to say, Lord, you've been in charge of my life up to now.

You've always worked things out, and right now something is there in my life that's bad, but I trust you enough to believe that you're working it out for good, so I thank you for it. I thank you for it. That's the end of anxiety.

What about resentment in your life? Do you realize that you cannot stay resentful of people if you're thankful to God? You see, when you're resentful, you're sitting there like this.

I would give anything to see that person get what he or she deserves. I would give anything to see that person get what he or she deserves. If you live a life of gratitude, here's what happens.

You say, Father, you're never giving me what I deserve. Why should I be so concerned about seeing he gets what he deserves? What's wrong with me?

Where's the logic in all that? And it's over. Your bitterness is over.

Your worry is over. Even that bad self-image is over. Because you get power and freedom in your life to the degree that you can say, Father, thank you for accepting me fully in Jesus Christ.

I don't have to prove myself anymore to anybody. Thankfulness is the mainspring. Power and freedom and joy in your life to the degree you exercise and use the gratitude you've got.

But there's another kind of person in the room. Here's what you have to figure out. You may be a person with a general belief in God.

You may even have been fairly moral and religious all of your life. But unless you see that the salvation that Jesus Christ gives us is an absolutely free gift, one that you receive with gratitude, acceptance with God is not something that you can earn through your striving, you see. Your life has been mainly, mainly pushed by need and fear instead of by love.

What you need to do is you need to come and say, Lord Jesus Christ, I see that my Father, God is the creator. I owe him everything. I see that what you've done is you've made it possible for me to come to you, to God, because you've taken my punishment.

I give myself to you. I trust in you. Command me.

I'm no longer my authority. Command me. Let your pleasure be my pleasure.

Your love, my love. Your joy, my joy. After Jesus Christ healed ten lepers in Luke chapter 17, only one came back.

And he fell down, which is a posture of obedience. He fell down and he thanked Jesus. And Jesus says, where are the nine?

This is the only one that thanked me. And he looked at him and he said, go in peace. Thy faith has made you whole.

Do you know what faith is? Faith is not so mysterious. It's being willing to respond to the offer of Jesus Christ with gratitude and to say, because of what you've done for me, I give you myself.

Go in peace. Thy faith has made thee whole. Let's pray.

对很多人来说，它们可能带来罪疚和羞耻的感觉，或者看起来像是一份根本无法遵循的规则列表。在今天的讲道中，提姆·凯勒牧师向我们展示，神赐下十诫并不是为用无法实现的道德标准来压垮我们，而是为了指引我们向耶稣基督，祂是唯一完美地成全神律法的人。从天上正显明神的忿怒，临到一切不敬虔和不义的人，就是那些用不义压制真理的人。因为自从创造世界以来，神那看不见的特性、永恒的能力和神性，都是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物，就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。

因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。自称为聪明，却变成愚拙，将那不朽坏之神的荣耀变为偶像，仿佛必朽坏的人、飞禽、走兽和爬虫的样式。所以，神任凭他们随心所欲，以致彼此玷污自己的身体。

压制真理就是不承认神的存在，而人们压制真理的原因是什么呢？在第21节中说，他们不感谢神。是什么惹动这位伟大创造主的忿怒呢？是忘恩负义。

一位如此伟大神的上帝，一位可以用手指拨弄星辰如沙子的创造者，对银河系而言不过是个绒毛般的存在，这样伟大而良善的存在为何生气呢？是不感恩。有人可能会问，上帝是否小题大做呢？为什么上帝会因忘恩而愤怒呢？

似乎这是一件小事。然而，我们自己却非常认真地对待这个问题。比如说，如果你是一名音乐人，抄袭他人的作品，或者你是一名作家，抄袭他人的文章，或作为学者或学生，把别人写的东西发表出来，声称自己是作者，因此就好像具备权威一般——因为“authority”源自“author”——这种行为是违法的。为什么？

这是抄袭。而抄袭就是一种忘恩，因为它本质上是否认自己依赖于他人承认，而选择以独立自主的姿态出现。让我们谈到另一个层面。在第一次世界大战期间，如果美国抓到一个试图推翻美国政府的德国士兵，他会被如何对待？

根据国际法，他应当被尊重，关入战俘营；但如果是美国人这么做，那就是叛国，那么为什么惩罚会不同呢？因为作为美国公民，他欠这个国家一份恩情。忘恩负义对我们来说，是个极为严重的问题。如果你没有将生命的主权交给神，即便你在某种意义上承认神的存在，但你仍然自己做自己的主人，那就是对宇宙的抄袭。

**真正的献身是**将自己的一切，包括思想、生命的每个部分，都交给神的旨意和话语。**这是背叛，是"宇宙的叛国"。这种忘恩负义在最高意义上是非常严重的，而圣经对此进行了极深刻的讨论。保罗在罗马书第一章中指出，人类虽知神，却拒不归荣耀给他或感谢他，这是压制真理**的表现。

因此，我们**真正的挑战是**，是否在生活中真正承认上帝作为我们的作者，而不仅仅是在口头上。**这是一个秘密的背叛，因为你对自己保密。它说，即使你知道有一位上帝，无论你是谁，那位创造你的、属于你的、你欠债的上帝，我们都在某种程度上压抑了这个真理**。我们压抑它。

我们知道我们在叛变，但我们对自己都保密，然而我们也知道这是事实。这也是这段经文中奇怪的地方。它说他们认识上帝，但同时又说他们压抑这种认识。你知道有一笔绝对重要且充满喜悦的债务，要还给创造者上帝，但你却好像不知道。

我想任何心理学家都会告诉你，那些你在某种程度上知道但又不愿承认的事情是不健康的。它们可以影响你的一生。这段深刻的经文实际上正在对我们进行一种深层次的治疗。它说，正视你对自己的认识，否则你将永远被困于浅薄、痛苦和困惑中。

因此，这段经文说，让我们来看看这种压抑的结构，看看每个人生活中这种秘密背叛的结构是什么。这种结构就在这里。让我给你一个大纲，然后我们来逐步分析。这个大纲非常有趣。

首先，它说，忘恩负义导致压抑。它说他们因为忘恩负义而压抑真理。让我们这样说，忘恩负义导致压抑。然后我们被告知，压抑导致黑暗。

在第21节中，它说，因为他们不愿感谢他，他们的思想变得虚妄，心中充满黑暗。忘恩负义导致压抑，压抑导致黑暗，然后黑暗导致所有的问题。这个黑暗导致你生命中的所有问题，所有的行为问题，所有的不良习惯，所有的罪。忘恩负义导致压抑，压抑导致黑暗，黑暗导致我们所有的罪。

唯一的答案，这段经文告诉我们，就是用有关上帝是谁以及我们欠他的债的真理来交换谎言，把真理放回你生命的中心，喜乐再次爆发。这就是这段经文所说的，但让我们细分这些步骤。第一步，好吧，第一步。这里说，忘恩负义导致压抑。

你看到在第21节开头的这个词汇"因为"吗？它说因为。压抑和抑制真理的原因，即使他们看到大自然中明显有一位创造者上帝，保罗说，是因为他们不愿意荣耀他为上帝或感谢他，他们压抑了这个真理。这非常重要。

说“我同意有神”是一回事，让他在生活中被荣耀为上帝是另一回事。圣经中的荣耀字面意思是给予某事物重量。保罗说的不是人们否认有神的存在，而是他们否认这个神对他们的真实意义。他们想要否认上帝，想要否认上帝作为上帝的身份。

他们不愿以完全严肃的态度对待他，他们想要成为自己的主人。他们想要自己做主。当他们看到宇宙背后有一位上帝时，他们不去得出那样的逻辑结论。如果宇宙背后有一位上帝，那么我就不应该是自己的权威。

我应该给他至高的权力。顺便说一下，保罗在第20节中提到，从世界造以来，上帝永恒的能力和神性是明明可知的；虽是眼不能见，然而藉着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。他在这里使用了一个古老且无可辩驳的关于上帝存在的论点。他说，看看外面。

看看设计，看看自然，看看设计。他在使用这个古老的论据。他说，想象一下，他说，想象一下，油漆厂的一次爆炸能创造出《蒙娜丽莎》。当然是偶然的，但你知道，东西升起又落下，恰好落在画布上，以这样一种方式画出了这幅美丽的图画。

那样的机会有多大？你会说那没有机会。当然，任何数学家都会告诉你，那不是真的。不能说没有这样的机会。

当然，那种事情发生的机会是微乎其微的。但保罗说，那种事情发生的机会远远超过了所有这些秩序和设计及美丽偶然出现的可能性。然而，他说，令人惊讶的是，许多人愿意将他们的整个人生赌在那个机会之上。每当我向别人提出这个论点时，每当我问，所有的这些偶然发生的机会有多大时，他们会说，那并不能证明上帝的存在。

不，确实不。并不能证明《蒙娜丽莎》不能由油漆厂的爆炸绘制出来。但是哪种傻瓜会愿意用自己的人生去赌这个？保罗所说的是任何这样做的人都显示出了偏见。

保罗说，如果你真的愿意如此压抑真相，那就显示出了一种偏见。你知道，弗洛伊德、马克思、费尔巴哈和尼采都说基督徒需要上帝。因为他们在心理上需要上帝。你看，他们当然对此有不同的看法。

马克思说，富人需要上帝来压制穷人。而弗洛伊德则说，人们需要上帝，因为他们需要一个神来为他们对权威的反叛赎罪。尼采有自己的看法，路德维希·费尔巴哈也有，他们都说人们需要相信上帝是有心理原因的。顺便说一句，这是真的。

保罗在这里指出的是，人们不相信上帝有更大的、极深的心理原因。因为即使我们看向外面，说是的，显然必定有一位上帝，但如果有一位创造所有这些设计的个人神，那么我们就欠他权威。没有中间地带。要么没有上帝，这一切都是偶然，要么有上帝，我们欠他一切。

我们不想要那样。所以你看，保罗说有非常深刻的心理原因去否认上帝。这对我来说是有道理的，因为多年来，当我与人交谈时，当你简单地分享基督教的信息时，它大概是这样的。基督教的信息是这样的。

上帝创造了你，虽然你一生都以自己的权威活着，做自己的决定，制定你自己的道德标准，设定自己的目标，但上帝仍然爱你，他进入了你的境况，他在耶稣基督的身上进入了历史，他承受了你因忘恩负义所应受的惩罚，使我们可以进入一个永恒的。。。与我们的创造主建立爱的关系，并拥有一个被喜乐和感恩的爱支配的生活。

这就是信息。理性的拒绝方法，可能是说“我不能接受，因为这好得令人难以置信。”这就如同有人告诉我这是真实的，该有多好。然而，过去几年我收到的反应却不是这样的。

反应通常是：“你又来了，试图告诉我该怎么生活。”这显示了一种深层的偏见。保罗是这样说的：有些人宁愿把他们的生命押在一线的希望上。忏悔不足会导致压抑，进而导致黑暗。

21节说，因为他们不愿意感谢他，他们的思维就变得虚妄，他们无知的心就昏暗了。这里的“虚妄”意思是没有意义，以及不能看到事物的目的。事实上，保罗在这里想要说的是，如果你不愿意接受这位个人的神，因为你不愿让他主宰你的生命，那么你就处于一个很可怕的位置。如果没有这位个人的神，就没有对错，没有道德结构，没有道德结构的事情，就只剩下黑暗。

我们都在追逐成功、真爱或完美的生活，这些好事很容易就变成了终极的东西。当我们把信仰放在它们上面时，内心深处，我们知道它们无法满足我们最深的渴望。事实是，我们把这些好事变成了次要的神明，无法给我们真正需要的东西。在他的书《伪神》中，Tim Keller向我们展示了如何通过正确理解圣经来揭示社会理想和我们内心的真相，并向我们展示只有一位神才能完全满足我们的欲望。

一个是关于伍迪·艾伦的新电影《罪与罚》，它的剧情大致是这样的：有一个人是个道德人，但并不是宗教人。他是一个有良知的道德人，但没有多少宗教的基础。他生活得还不错，直到他与一名空姐发生了一段小外遇。空姐看起来要揭发他，试图让他的妻子离开他。

他陷入了困境，他的生活可能会崩溃，于是他开始考虑有人建议的方法，就是杀掉这个女人。他找到了一个拉比，拉比告诉他说，宇宙中必须有一个道德结构，如果没有，就没有意义，也没有办法生活。所以你必须做正确的事情。我不能说得更详细了，因为剧透是不对的，对吧？

但我可以告诉你，这部电影的结局没有一个好的解决。这个电影的讯息就像《传道书》的尾声一样悬而未决。电影的讯息是，我们无法知道宇宙中是否存在一个道德结构，但必须有一个。然而，我们被卡住了。

没有宗教的道德是无效的，没有个人创造者的道德结构是无效的，这是我们知道的。让我给您一个案例研究。几年前，如果你还记得，那时有一系列关于核浩劫的小型系列剧和电影。《第二天》是其中一部迷你剧，不是特别好，但那时有许多好电影。

大家纷纷写信说，如果文明因为核灾难被摧毁，那该有多可怕。我在那个时候读到一篇让我震惊的文章，我想和你分享一下。文章中的人说，将文明因核灾难而毁灭视为可怕，假设了一个个人神的存在。他说，既然大多数受过教育的人要么不相信神，要么至少认为无法知道是否有神，因此既然大多数受过教育的人相信自然是唯一可以确定存在的东西，保罗在第20节说自然背后有一个个人神，但这篇文章的作者说，既然大多数受过教育的人知道除了自然没有其他东西，他说，无论我们的文明是在今天结束还是在十亿年后结束，实际上并没有区别。

因为在文明之前和之后的死寂时间海洋中，我们的文明只是一个微不足道的、偶然的火花，没有人会在乎，也没有人能够理解或记得。所以他说，谁会在乎呢？要说文明可能因核浩劫而结束是可怕的，这种说法假设并预设了一个个人创造神。他这样说，并且他补充，如果你不知道这一点，那么就没有理由为此而担心。

你知道吗？我不知道你如何看待这一点，但如果你说，我不知道，也许你在说，我不知道是否存在一个创造神，但我拒绝这个论点，你就是在与黑暗抗争。因为保罗说，如果你压抑了创造神的概念，你会陷入那篇文章所描述的黑暗中。没有中间的选择，要么有一个创造神，你欠他一切，并给予他对你生活的主权和权威，要么就是黑暗。

实际上，我还要提供第三个案例研究。C.S.刘易斯，作为一个基督徒，他曾经写过一篇文章指出，如果除了自然以外，什么也不存在，如果没有创造神，如果没有超自然现实，只有自然，那恋爱意味着什么？他说，挺有趣的，他说，如果你知道并且持续记住，所有的美丽，无论是她的外表还是她的品格，都是由原子碰撞产生的短暂而偶然的模式，你就不能用最低的动物感受来爱上一个姑娘。而且，你对它们的反应只是你的染色体行为所引发的一种心理磷光现象。

你也不能从音乐中获得**真正的乐趣。现在情况变得更糟，对吧？你也不能从音乐中获得真正的乐趣，如果你知道并且记住它的意义完全是**错觉，而且你只喜欢它是因为你的神经系统被刺激到了。接受基督教导的人和仅仅对信仰持一般态度的人之间的区别就在于感恩是否成为你生活的主动力。

我常常与那些觉得需要神的人交谈，他们感到生活中的空虚，所以他们说：“我需要神。”于是，他们可能来找我，问：“我该怎么做？我去教会吗？读圣经吗？

改善自己的生活吗？我准备好了，但不知道自己是否与神连接。” 虽然他们感到这种需要，但他们被自私和恐惧驱动。他们害怕被神拒绝，害怕错失良机，于是尽力改善自己的生活，然后说：“我已经把自己交给神了，所以现在我希望他在我生命中工作。

”而且，判断你是否这种操控者的方法就是，一旦生活中出现不顺利的事情，你就准备把神踢出去。“这有何用？我开始去教会，现在看看。” 有些人可能正处在这种状态中，可能你今天来这里就是因为开始感受到内心的空虚，想要更多，你想着：“我该怎么做？

被需求和一点恐惧驱动。”这并不是基督徒生活的推动力。基督徒的生活这样运作：操控者与侍者之间的区别是，侍者的思维是这样的：“是的，我需要神。我知道如果找不到神，事情会对我不利，但在我需要神之前，我欠神一个人情。

我欠他我的生命，我的爱，无论他从此以后为我做什么。我看到耶稣基督已为我做了所有。” 耶稣基督来，为我活、为我死，我可以完全免费地接受我的救恩、我的解放、与神的接纳。因为我看到了这一点，我就可以过一种感恩的生活。

请听，一种感恩的生活是奇妙的。当有人为你做了美好的事情时，你会感到一种义务感。这是真实的义务，不是自愿的，你会说：“我欠你。”因此，这是一种义务感，你感觉被束缚。

这不是自愿的，但也不是奴役，而是爱。是被爱驱动的，而不是恐惧。这就是感恩生活的意义。在这房间里有两种人。

让我这样总结，我并不知道你是谁，也无意指出你。事实上，你最好别看房间里的任何人，因为这很难搞清楚，要搞清楚自己都已经很困难了。别担心别人。一方面，有人在这房间里接受了基督为他们的主和救主，因此，他们理解救恩是免费的礼物，生活的主动力就是这种感恩。

生命的意义在于感恩。然而，事实上，你满是问题。我对你们说，把感恩融入你生活的每一个细节。比如，你会担心吗？

你这周担心了吗？腓立比书4章说，不要忧虑什么，而要感恩。你知道**这意味着什么吗？这意味着你能否对主说：“主啊，直到现在你一直掌管我的生命。**

你总是把事情捋顺，而现在我的生命中有一些不好的事情，但我信任你，相信你将这一切化为益处，所以我感谢你。我感谢你。”这就是结束焦虑的方法。你生活中有没有怨恨呢？

你是否意识到，如果你对神心存感恩，你就不能对别人保持怨恨？你看，当你怨恨时，你心里想着：“我什么都愿意付出，只要看到那个人得到他或她应得的。”如果你过着感恩的生活，事情就变成这样。你说：“天父，你从未给我应得的惩罚。

我为什么要如此关注他得到应得的呢？是什么让我如此不合理？”于是，一切怨恨就结束了，你的苦毒结束了，你的忧虑结束了，甚至你对自己的负面想象也是如此。因为当你说：“天父，感谢你在耶稣基督里完全接纳我。

”时，你的生命中就获得了能力和自由。我再也不需向任何人证明自己。感恩是动力的泉源。你在生活中获得的能力、自由和喜悦，取决于你运用和行使感恩的程度。

不过，房间里还有另一种人。你需要弄明白，你可能是一个对神有大致信仰的人。甚至你可能一生都相当道德和宗教。但除非你看到耶稣基督给我们的救恩是绝对的免费礼物，一个你以感恩之心接受的礼物，获得与神的和好并不是你靠努力挣得的。

你的人生主要是被需要和恐惧所驱动，而不是被爱。你需要做的是走向前来说：“主耶稣基督，我看到我的父神是创造者，我欠他一切。我看到你所做的一切使我能来到你面前，来到神面前，因为你承担了我的惩罚。我把自己交给你，我信靠你。

命令我吧，我不再是自己的权威。你的喜悦成为我的喜悦，你的爱成为我的爱，你的喜乐成为我的喜乐。” 在路加福音17章中，耶稣基督治好了十个麻风病人，只有一个回来。他俯伏在地，这是顺服的姿态，他感谢耶稣。

耶稣说：“其他九个在哪里？只有这个回来感谢我。”耶稣看着他说：“去吧，平安无事，你的信救了你。”你知道信心是什么吗？

信心并不神秘，它是愿意以感恩之心回应耶稣基督的邀请，说：“因为你为我所做的一切，我将自己献给你。”去吧，平安无事，你的信救了你。让我们祷告。感谢你们聆听今天的教导。
