## 引言与经文宣读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Are you longing to see real change in your life, in your habits, your relationships, your heart? Today, Tim Keller explores how lasting change actually happens in the life of a Christian and why the Gospel offers a radically different process of transformation than anything else.

Tonight's scripture reading is found in Romans chapter 8, verse 28, and then verses 38 and 39. And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good, for those who are called according to His purpose. Where I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

This is God's Word. We've been looking for a few weeks at Romans 6, 7, and 8, and we said that this is especially about how Jesus concretely changes your life when He comes into it. And what I wanted to do was just one last time, I wanted to look at this ending of Romans chapter 8.

It's a magnificent ending, and yet its point is very simple. In these last several verses, in these last several verses Paul says, here's the thing I'm giving you that will absolutely change your life through Christ. And the thing that He's giving us is an assurance.

He says, this is the thing you can get out every day and use. This is the thing that will change your life. But as He expresses the assurance, for us in our modern Western culture, a question comes up.

So it's very hard for us in our modern Western culture just to receive this thing and to enjoy it and to use it unimpeded. So what we're going to do tonight is look at this assurance, actually first let me read it to you. Let me read you the whole last 12 verses.

Listen to what He's saying. It's really saying one thing. I read it in a slightly different translation.

And we know that all things are working together for good, for those who love God and who are called according to His purpose. For those who for new, He predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son. And those He predestined, He called.

And those He called, He justified. And those He justified, He glorified. What then shall we say to these things?

If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all. How will He not also together with Him freely give us all things?

Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn. It is Christ who died.

More than that was raised than is ever at the right hand of God interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

No. In all things, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. We are absolutely certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor anything to come nor height nor depth nor anything in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

There's an assurance there and I'd like to look at them to three headings. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured, how we can make this assurance, not just an abstraction, but an operative thing in our lives. That we can be assured, why we can be assured and how we can be assured.

欢迎来到《福音人生》。你是否渴望在你的生活中看到真正的改变——你的习惯、你的关系、你的内心？今天，提摩太·凯勒探讨了在基督徒的生活中持久的改变实际上是如何发生的，以及为什么福音提供了一个与其他任何方式截然不同的转变过程。

今晚的经文选自《罗马书》第8章第28节，以及第38和39节。我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。因为我深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。

这是神的话语。我们已经花了几周时间查看《罗马书》第6、7、8章，我们说这些章节特别关于当耶稣进入你的生命时，他如何具体地改变你的生活。我想做的就是再最后一次，看看《罗马书》第8章的结尾。

这是一个宏伟的结尾，然而它的重点非常简单。在这最后几节经文中，保罗说：这就是我给你的东西，它将通过基督彻底改变你的生命。他给我们的这个东西是一个确据。

他说，这是你每天可以拿出来使用的东西。这是将要改变你生命的东西。但是当他表达这个确据时，对于我们现代西方文化来说，一个问题就出现了。

所以对我们现代西方文化来说，很难只是接受这个东西，享受它，毫无阻碍地使用它。那么今晚我们要做的就是看看这个确据。实际上，首先让我读给你听。让我把这最后12节经文全部读给你听。

听听他在说什么。这真的是在说一件事。我用一个稍微不同的译本来读。

我们知道万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，就是按他旨意被召的人。因为他预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法他儿子的模样。预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。

既是这样，我们对这一切该怎么说呢？神若帮助我们，谁能抵挡我们呢？神既不爱惜自己的儿子，为我们众人舍了，岂不也把万物和他一同白白地赐给我们吗？

谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了。谁能定他们的罪呢？有基督耶稣已经死了，而且从死里复活，现今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。

谁能使我们与基督的爱隔绝呢？难道是患难吗？是困苦吗？是逼迫吗？是饥饿吗？是赤身露体吗？是危险吗？是刀剑吗？

不。在这一切的事上，我们已经得胜有余了，都是靠着爱我们的主。我们确信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。

这里有一个确据，我想用三个标题来看它。我们可以得确据，为什么我们可以得确据，以及我们如何可以得确据——如何使这个确据不只是一个抽象概念，而是在我们生活中运作的实际事物。我们可以得确据，为什么我们可以得确据，以及我们如何可以得确据。

## 确据的内容：无论如何神都爱你 / The Assurance: God Loves You No Matter What

First, briefly, that we can be assured, what is His point? Here's His point, there's a joy to be had. There's a joy to be had that if you have it, we'll enable you to face anything in life without sinking or crumbling.

And this joy is a certitude, it's a certainty, an absolute certainty that God doesn't just love you now, it's a certainty that He does love you now in Christ, but He always will. And nothing can shake that and nothing can separate you from that, no matter what. The Lord of the universe loves you not just now, but always will.

That's the assurance. And this assurance is two forks. Because once you've connected with God through Jesus Christ, this assurance is two forks.

The first is, well, I'll tell you what the two forks are right off, it means that God loves you no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you, and no matter how much bad stuff is happening outside you, no matter how bad the stuff is happening inside you, no matter how bad the stuff is that's happening outside you, you can be sure He still loves you. See, first of all, no matter how bad stuff is going on inside you, sometimes we do some awful stuff. I want you to know that there is stuff in your heart that you don't know about yet.

And then when it pops up, you're going to say, I can't believe I'm capable of that. And you're going to be so dissolution with yourself and you're going to be so mad yourself. And when those times happen, what do you say?

You say, I can't believe that God could love me after I've done that. And yet here's what Paul says, he says, who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies who is to condemn.

It is Christ Jesus who died. More than that was raised and is ever at the right hand of God, interceding for us. Not one thing that you can possibly do today can bring you back into condemnation.

It's all covered. It's all paid for, see. God loves you no matter how much bad stuff happens inside you.

But secondly, we're told, the other fork of the assurance, is that God loves you no matter how much bad stuff is happening outside you. You see this list, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword. See, when bad stuff happens, when everything is going wrong, you feel like God doesn't love me or he wouldn't let all this stuff happen.

See, really bad stuff happens inside. You say, oh, look at what a mess I am, God couldn't love me. But when really bad stuff happens outside, you say, look what a mess life is.

Obviously, God has abandoned me. There can't be a loving God, and yet Paul says, oh, yes, there can be. No matter how bad the mess is on the outside, you still can be assured, he says that God loves you, because he says in verse 28, what?

He says, all things are working together for good to those that love God. Now what does that mean? Taken together as a whole, look at from the long term.

Every single thing that happens, every single thing God is working together into a plan for our good and for His glory. That's what it says. And my favorite biblical example of that are two incidents that happen in a place called Dothan.

In Genesis, the first thing that happens at Dothan is that Joseph is thrown into a pit by his brothers, and he's going to be sold into slavery. So he's got a life of absolute misery ahead of him, and he prays to God, oh, God, get me out of this. Don't let me be sold into slavery.

And guess what, silence, silence. And he is sold into slavery, and he has a horrible miserable life for years and years and years and years. And then many centuries later, the second thing that happens in Dothan, Elisha is in Dothan.

Now it's a city, and it's besieged by an enemy, and he's afraid that they're going to be overrun and destroyed. And Elisha cries out the God and says, oh, Lord, please save us. Please save us from this peril.

And this time, God sends chariots of fire and wipes out the invading army and everybody saved. But if you know the story of Joseph, you know that if he hadn't been sold into slavery, and if he hadn't gone through all those years of misery, not only would have hundreds of thousands of people died of famine, but his own family would have been destroyed by their own sin. And what that means, if you know the story, you know how it works out, and what that means is that God was just as actively working everything together for good in Joseph's life as in Elisha's life.

He was just as actively working in the seeming slowness and non-answer to Joseph as he was in the swift, noisy answer to Elisha. And so Paul says, that's always the case. And so no matter how much bad stuff's happening inside you, no matter how much bad stuff's happening outside you, you can be assured God absolutely and fallibly, unchangeably loves you.

首先，简单说，我们可以得确据，他的重点是什么？这是他的重点：有一种喜乐可以得到。有一种喜乐，如果你拥有它，将使你能够面对生活中的任何事情而不会沉沦或崩溃。

这种喜乐是一种确信，是一种确定性，一种绝对的确定性——神不只是现在爱你，而是确定他现在在基督里爱你，而且他将永远爱你。没有什么能动摇这一点，没有什么能使你与之分离，无论发生什么。宇宙的主宰不只是现在爱你，而且将永远爱你。

这就是确据。这个确据有两个方面。因为一旦你通过耶稣基督与神连结，这个确据有两个方面。

第一个方面是，好吧，让我直接告诉你这两个方面是什么。这意味着无论你内心发生什么糟糕的事情，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事情，神都爱你。无论你内心发生的事情有多糟糕，无论你外面发生的事情有多糟糕，你都可以确信他仍然爱你。看，首先，无论你内心发生什么糟糕的事情。有时候我们会做一些可怕的事情。我想让你知道，在你的心里有你还不知道的东西。

然后当它冒出来的时候，你会说："我不敢相信我能做出这样的事。"你会对自己感到如此幻灭，你会对自己如此生气。当那些时刻发生时，你说什么？

你说："我不敢相信在我做了那件事之后神还会爱我。"然而保罗在这里说什么？他说："谁能控告神所拣选的人呢？有神称他们为义了。谁能定他们的罪呢？"

有基督耶稣已经死了，而且从死里复活，现今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。今天你可能做的任何事情都不能使你重新回到定罪之中。

这一切都被遮盖了。这一切都被偿付了，看到了吗？无论你内心发生多少糟糕的事情，神都爱你。

但第二，我们被告知，确据的另一个方面是，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事情，神都爱你。看看这个清单：患难、困苦、逼迫、饥饿、赤身露体、危险、刀剑。看，当糟糕的事情发生时，当一切都出错时，你觉得神不爱我，否则他不会让所有这些事情发生。

看，当内心真正糟糕的事情发生时，你说："哦，看看我是多么混乱，神不可能爱我。"但当外面真正糟糕的事情发生时，你说："看看生活是多么混乱。"

显然，神已经抛弃了我。不可能有一个慈爱的神。然而保罗说："哦，不，可能有。"无论外面的混乱有多糟糕，你仍然可以确信，他说神爱你，因为他在第28节说了什么？

他说：万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。这是什么意思呢？从整体来看，从长远来看。

每一件发生的事情，每一件事情，神都在将它们一起编织成一个计划，为了我们的益处和他的荣耀。这就是经文所说的。我最喜欢的圣经例子是发生在一个叫多坍的地方的两个事件。

在《创世记》中，在多坍发生的第一件事是约瑟被他的兄弟扔进坑里，他将被卖为奴隶。所以他面前有一个绝对悲惨的生活，他向神祷告："哦，神啊，救我脱离这个。不要让我被卖为奴隶。"

你猜怎么着？沉默，沉默。他被卖为奴隶，他度过了可怕悲惨的生活，年复一年。然后许多世纪之后，在多坍发生的第二件事，以利沙在多坍。

现在它是一座城市，被敌人围困，他害怕他们会被攻陷和毁灭。以利沙向神呼求说："哦，主啊，请拯救我们。请拯救我们脱离这个危险。"

这一次，神派遣火车火马，消灭了入侵的军队，每个人都得救了。但如果你知道约瑟的故事，你就知道，如果他没有被卖为奴隶，如果他没有经历所有那些年的痛苦，不仅会有成千上万的人死于饥荒，而且他自己的家人也会被他们自己的罪所毁灭。如果你知道这个故事，你知道它是如何发展的，这意味着神在约瑟的生活中积极地使万事互相效力的程度，就像他在以利沙的生活中一样。

他在看似缓慢和对约瑟的无回应中积极地工作，就像他在对以利沙的迅速、响亮的回应中一样。所以保罗说，总是这样。所以无论你内心发生多少糟糕的事情，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事情，你都可以确信神绝对地、无误地、不变地爱你。

## 没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝 / Nothing Can Separate You from God's Love

And then when he gets to the very end, he has a sweeping statement in verse 38 and 39, which is printed out there. And at this point, Paul says, I am absolutely certain. He uses the word that means absolute intent, certainty and persuasion.

And then he just bursts. He pushes. He stretches out to the limits of language to try to say neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor heaven, nor hell nor height nor death, nothing.

Nothing can separate you for the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, nothing. Nothing can dislodge you from his love and nothing can dislodge his love from you. And there are people who have looked at this passage and said, oh, well, yes, but nothing can separate you from God, but you could separate yourself.

Because if you start out to follow Jesus and you turn back, you can lose your salvation, you can lose his love. So maybe nothing can separate you from God's love, but you can separate yourself. And that is not right.

That is not the right way to read that text. And I'll tell you why. Look, what does it say?

If you could turn back, if you could separate yourself from the love of God, aren't you part of creation? He says, nothing at all of creation can separate you from the love of God. Aren't you part of creation?

Last, by my look, you were. What Paul is trying to say is every possible situation that might turn you away from God, every possible situation that might turn you away from God, persecution, torture. None of those things will.

Because love is so powerful, they will keep you facing him, keep you loving him, keep you in his arms no matter what. So see, here's your assurance, no matter how much all the powers of evil inside you and all the powers of evil outside you cannot separate you from the love of God, can't dislodge you from it, can't dislodge love of God from you. Once you give yourself to God through Christ, He is yours, you are His, nothing ever, ever can change that, that's the assurance.

---

然后当他到最后的时候，他在第38和39节有一个全面的陈述，那里打印出来了。在这一点上，保罗说："我深信。"他使用的词意味着绝对的意图、确定性和说服力。

然后他就爆发了。他推动。他伸展到语言的极限，试图说：无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，无论是天堂，是地狱，是高处，是死亡，什么都没有。

没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝，这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的，什么都没有。没有什么能把你从他的爱中赶出去，没有什么能把他的爱从你那里赶出去。有些人看着这段经文说："哦，是的，但没有什么能使你与神隔绝，但你可以使自己与神隔绝。"

因为如果你开始跟随耶稣然后转身离开，你可能失去你的救恩，你可能失去他的爱。所以也许没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝，但你可以使自己与神的爱隔绝。这是不对的。

这不是阅读那段经文的正确方式。我告诉你为什么。看，经文说什么？

如果你能转身离开，如果你能使自己与神的爱隔绝，你不是创造物的一部分吗？他说，创造物中没有任何东西能使你与神的爱隔绝。你不是创造物的一部分吗？

根据我的观察，你是。保罗试图说的是，每一个可能使你远离神的情况，每一个可能使你远离神的情况，逼迫、酷刑——这些事情都不会。

因为爱是如此强大，它们会让你面对他，让你爱他，让你在他的怀抱中，无论发生什么。所以看，这就是你的确据：无论你内心所有的邪恶力量和你外面所有的邪恶力量有多少，都不能使你与神的爱隔绝，不能把你从中赶出去，不能把神的爱从你那里赶出去。一旦你通过基督把自己交给神，他是你的，你是他的，永远、永远不会改变，这就是确据。

## 自由意志与神的主权 / Free Will and the Sovereignty of God

Now we could, it would be great if we could just move on and say, so now how does that work in your life what we can't? Because as I said, in our Western culture, this sort of, this promise immediately raises an issue. Now the reason I say Western culture is pretty important, because we have an objection that really bothers us, all this talk about predestination, right?

And calling an election, God working everything out according to His plan, now this bothers us, but don't forget who us is, it's us, there's other centuries and there's other cultures that this doesn't bother, this is a problem for a modern Western enlightenment drenched, individualistic people. And it's always good to remember that, this great objection we have, we must not absolutize any of our objections, they always arise out of our culture and we should take it seriously because here's where we live. But it's not, you know, we're not the only culture in the world and we shouldn't therefore say this is an insuperable obstacle to faith in Christ.

However, here's the thing that modern Western people say, when they hear that Jesus Christ will keep you in His love so that no matter what we do, we'll never stop loving Him and He'll never stop loving us. And He's totally in control of everything so everything is working out according to His plan. The first thing that comes to our mind is, well, hey, what about free will then?

See, that's our problem. What about human responsibility? Because it sounds like God is doing all this stuff despite our choices, that everything is going to happen, is going to happen in spite of our choices.

And if that's the case, well, then who cares how you live? Who cares what you do? It's all going to happen, see?

You know, I'm a Christian so now, you know, it doesn't really matter. I don't have to do anything because He's going to keep me loving Him and everything's working out according to His plan. Well, then it doesn't really matter.

So what happens to free will and what happens to personal responsibility? That's a good question. And in modern, when I said this is a Western issue in particular, we're reminded of that this last week in the Science Times, New York Times.

On Tuesday, there was a big article, and the name of it was the power of free will. Now you have it, now you don't. And it was a kind of survey of the current debate right now about whether we have free will or not.

And the consensus of most of the scientists and the people in the article was we don't. Now it's intriguing for a person of my age is it's interesting that the last, you know, now the real question is, do we have free will or are we determined by our evolutionary biology? That's the issue now.

See, the argument is that natural selection is what determines everything about us. So we think we're choosing to love someone or fall in love with someone. We think we're choosing that, but actually we're hardwired to do that to pass on our genetic material, so we don't really have free will.

And so that's the debate. Do we have free will or not, or are we hardwired by our biology? It's funny, because 30 years ago when I was in college, the argument was a psychological one, not a biological one.

The argument was a Freudian one, as it were, and that is, do we have free will or are we completely controlled by our unconscious urges or our past or things like that? But the thing you always see in all these debates in the West is it's either or, either or, either we free have free will or everything is determined or put it this way. We believe either we have free will and we're responsible for our choices and our choices matter, and that means the future is open and undetermined either we have free will and the future is open undetermined or something has set and fixed the future and then our choices don't matter.

See, it's either or, but in the Bible, it's never either or, never. From the beginning to the end, in principle and in practice, it's always this, you are free and you are responsible and your choices matter and you're responsible for your choices and no one's forcing you to make those choices and yet, every single thing that happens as a result of those choices is worked out, is working out exactly according to the plan of God. And it's not just that God foresees what you're going to do, but rather what you do fits in with the plan that He wants and the course that He wants history to take.

现在我们可以——如果我们能够继续下去并说，那么这在你的生活中是如何运作的呢？我们不能。因为正如我所说，在我们的西方文化中，这个承诺立即引发了一个问题。现在我说西方文化的原因非常重要，因为我们有一个真正困扰我们的反对意见，所有这些关于预定的讨论，对吧？

关于呼召和拣选，神按照他的计划安排一切，现在这困扰着我们，但不要忘记"我们"是谁，它是我们，还有其他世纪和其他文化，这不困扰他们。这是现代西方启蒙运动浸透的、个人主义的人们的问题。记住这一点总是好的，我们有的这个巨大的反对意见，我们不能绝对化我们的任何反对意见，它们总是产生于我们的文化，我们应该认真对待它，因为这是我们生活的地方。但这不是，你知道，我们不是世界上唯一的文化，因此我们不应该说这是对基督信仰的一个不可逾越的障碍。

然而，这是现代西方人说的话，当他们听到耶稣基督会让你留在他的爱中，所以无论我们做什么，我们永远不会停止爱他，他永远不会停止爱我们。他完全控制一切，所以一切都按照他的计划进行。我们脑海中首先想到的是："嘿，那自由意志呢？"

看，这是我们的问题。人的责任呢？因为听起来神在做所有这些事情，不管我们的选择如何，一切都将发生，不管我们的选择如何。

如果是这样的话，那么谁在乎你怎么生活呢？谁在乎你做什么呢？这一切都会发生，看到了吗？

你知道，我是基督徒，所以现在，你知道，这真的不重要。我不必做任何事情，因为他会让我继续爱他，一切都按照他的计划进行。那么，这真的不重要。

那么自由意志会怎样呢？个人责任会怎样呢？这是一个好问题。在现代——当我说这是一个特别的西方问题时，我们在上周的《纽约时报》科学版上被提醒了这一点。

周二有一篇大文章，它的名字是"自由意志的力量。现在你有它，现在你没有"。这是对目前关于我们是否有自由意志的辩论的一种调查。

文章中大多数科学家和人们的共识是我们没有。现在，对于我这个年龄的人来说，有趣的是，在过去，你知道，现在真正的问题是，我们有自由意志，还是我们被我们的进化生物学所决定？这就是现在的问题。

看，论点是自然选择决定了我们的一切。所以我们认为我们在选择爱某人或爱上某人。我们认为我们在选择，但实际上我们被硬编码来这样做以传递我们的遗传物质，所以我们真的没有自由意志。

所以这就是辩论。我们有自由意志吗，还是我们被我们的生物学硬编码了？有趣的是，因为30年前当我在大学的时候，论点是一个心理学的论点，而不是一个生物学的论点。

论点是一个弗洛伊德式的论点，可以说，那就是，我们有自由意志，还是我们完全被我们的无意识冲动或我们的过去或类似的东西所控制？但你在西方所有这些辩论中总是看到的是非此即彼，非此即彼。要么我们有自由意志，要么一切都被决定。或者这样说：我们相信要么我们有自由意志，我们为我们的选择负责，我们的选择很重要，这意味着未来是开放的和未定的；要么我们有自由意志，未来是开放的、未定的；要么有什么东西设定并固定了未来，那么我们的选择就不重要了。

看，非此即彼，但在圣经中，从来不是非此即彼，从来不是。从头到尾，在原则上和实践中，总是这样：你是自由的，你是有责任的，你的选择很重要，你为你的选择负责，没有人强迫你做那些选择。然而，作为那些选择的结果发生的每一件事都被制定出来，正在按照神的计划进行。这不仅仅是神预见到你将要做什么，而是你所做的符合他想要的计划和他想要历史采取的路线。

## 圣经的"两者兼有"答案 / The Bible's Both/And Answer

There's so many examples I could give you, I'll just start with, I'll give you two. First of all, principle, listen to these proverbs, this is from Proverbs 16, verse 1. To man belongs the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the reply of the tongue.

And verse 9, the heart of man plans his way, but it is the Lord who establishes his steps. Hear that? To you belong the plans of your heart, but what you do as a result of the plan comes from God.

To you belongs your plans, but when you actually speak or act, that always fits in with God's plan, always. Now, that's astounding. See, on the one hand it says, your plans, your choices belong to you.

They're yours. They're not coerced. God is not doing it for you and you can't say I couldn't help it.

They're yours. You are free. You are responsible.

The result is always exactly what God wants. You say, how can that be? Well, that's because you're a Westerner and it's always either or, why does it have to be either or?

Can't God? Isn't it possible? The God could actually fix things and work things out and at the same time not violate your free will?

Why couldn't God do that? I can't imagine how I could do it. No.

Of course you can't, but you're under qualify for this job of God. Jack Packer puts it fascinatingly in his book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God. He says the relationship of our free will and responsibility and God's sovereignty and control of all things is an antinomy.

An antinomy, he defines, is not a contradiction but an apparent contradiction. And the example he uses is light. We know that light sometimes acts and behaves as waves and sometimes as particles.

Because it acts as if it does not have, it does not consist of matter and sometimes it acts as if it does. Now we don't know how that could be. It shouldn't be, but it is.

We don't know how that works, but we know it does work that way. And so we work with it, otherwise you're not going to know how to handle light. And Jack Packer says, see, it's obviously not a real contradiction, it's just an apparent contradiction.

We don't have the knowledge to figure it out, it's the same thing here. And if you want to see that we are absolutely, on the one hand, God is setting and fixing absolutely everything the way he wants it to be, but he doesn't do that despite our choices. But through them, our choices are part of his plan.

And you say, oh, so he just knows what we're going to choose. Yeah, but it's more than that. See, there you go.

You want to do the either or thing. No, it's both in. Both in.

我可以给你很多例子，我只从这里开始，我会给你两个。首先，原则上，听听这些箴言，这是《箴言》16章第1节。心中的谋算在乎人，舌头的应对由于耶和华。

第9节：人心筹算自己的道路，惟耶和华指引他的脚步。听到了吗？你心中的计划属于你，但作为计划的结果你所做的来自神。

你的计划属于你，但当你实际说话或行动时，那总是符合神的计划，总是。现在，这是令人惊讶的。看，一方面它说，你的计划，你的选择属于你。

它们是你的。它们不是被强迫的。神不是为你做的，你不能说"我无法帮助"。

它们是你的。你是自由的。你是有责任的。

结果总是完全是神想要的。你说，这怎么可能？嗯，那是因为你是一个西方人，总是非此即彼。为什么必须是非此即彼？

神不能吗？这不可能吗？神实际上可以固定事情并制定事情，同时又不违反你的自由意志吗？

为什么神不能那样做？我无法想象我怎么能做到。不。

当然你不能，但你不够资格担任神的这份工作。巴刻在他的书《传福音与神的主权》中巧妙地说。他说，我们的自由意志和责任与神的主权和对万事的控制之间的关系是一个悖论。

一个悖论，他定义说，不是一个矛盾，而是一个表面上的矛盾。他使用的例子是光。我们知道光有时表现得像波，有时表现得像粒子。

因为它有时表现得好像它不具有、不由物质组成，有时它表现得好像它具有。现在我们不知道这怎么可能。它不应该是这样，但它是。

我们不知道这是如何运作的，但我们知道它确实以那种方式运作。所以我们与它一起工作，否则你不会知道如何处理光。巴刻说，看，显然这不是一个真正的矛盾，这只是一个表面上的矛盾。

我们没有知识来弄清楚它，这里也是同样的事情。如果你想看到一方面，神绝对地设定并固定一切，按照他想要的方式，但他不是不顾我们的选择而这样做的。但通过它们，我们的选择是他计划的一部分。

你说："哦，所以他只是知道我们将要选择什么。"是的，但不仅仅是这样。看，你又来了。

你想做非此即彼的事情。不，是两者兼有。两者兼有。

## 保罗在船上：自由意志在行动 / Paul on the Boat: Free Will in Action

In Acts chapter 27, this is my favorite example in the Bible of this, Paul is on a boat with sailors and soldiers in a terrible storm, terrible storm. And in the midst of the storm when everybody's scared, the sailors and soldiers are really afraid that they're going to die, God sends an angel to Paul and says, the ship will be wrecked, but not one life will be lost. So Paul comes out on the deck and says, God has spoken to me.

And he has said that even though the ship will be wrecked, not one life will be lost. And now, Paul believed that, you know why? In the Old Testament, if you're a prophet and you make a prophecy, and that prophecy doesn't come true, the prophets put to death, you know why?

Because the Word of God is always sure. And if he actually gave you the Word of God, then it has to come true. So Paul was absolutely sure that it was God's plan and it was absolutely certain that no life would be lost.

But in verse 31 of Acts 27, it turns out that the sailors decide they were going to, you know, the storm is continuing on and the sailors decide they were going to sneak off the boat. So they start to get into the life boat. And when Paul sees the sailors, trying to get off the boat, he tells the soldiers to stop them and he says, if they leave the boat, we're all going to die.

Now I believe this is the beginning of the great army navy rivalry, actually. But beyond that, this doesn't make sense to us, doesn't it? Wait a minute, we would say to Paul, look, if you really believe that no one's life is going to be lost, if that's the way it is, if that's the plan of God, then who cares whether they get off the boat or not?

Who cares whether they get into the life boat, you know, go snorkel, it's all right. Because you see, we believe if it's fixed, it's fixed despite our choices, so choices don't matter. But see, here's what Paul is.

Paul has a biblical understanding of this. Our choices matter, absolutely they matter, but they don't determine the future. Because they matter, he's not passive.

So he says, let's do things the way we ought to do them. But because they don't determine the future, he's not paralyzed. He's neither passive nor paralyzed.

This 2025 comes to a close. It should come as no surprise that we have great hope for the year ahead. Because of what God is doing to bring people to faith and to renew Christians through the Gospel teaching and resources you help us provide on our podcast, YouTube channel, radio broadcast, quarterly journal, and website, and soon through our translation project, we're grateful that so many of you are partnering with us to spread the message of Christ's love.

Thank you. This continues to provide opportunities for us to expand the ways we share the Gospel. In 2026, we anticipate adding new international radio broadcasts and additional online ministry partnerships, publishing new books, and beginning to make Dr.

Keller's sermons available in other languages. So as we close out the year, we invite you to prayerfully consider making a year end gift to Gospel in life. The year end gifts we receive are a vital part of how we will prepare for ministry in 2026.

Our support allows us to share the story of the Gospel with people in over 200 countries, and we are deeply grateful for your participation in this mission. To make a year end gift, visit gospelonlife.com-giv, that's gospelonlife.com-giv. And please pray that we would steward your gifts well and that through the ministry of Gospel in life, many new people will find the hope and joy of knowing Christ as Savior.

Thank you for partnering with us to share the love of Christ with a world that needs Him because the Gospel truly changes everything. Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's message.

So if you believe everything's fixed, despite our choices, you'll be passive. If you believe that our choice has actually determined the future, then you should be paralyzed. But he's neither.

在《使徒行传》第27章，这是我在圣经中最喜欢的例子。保罗与水手和士兵在一艘船上，遇到了可怕的风暴，可怕的风暴。在风暴中，当每个人都害怕时，水手和士兵真的害怕他们会死去，神派一位天使去见保罗，说："船会沉没,但不会有一个人丧生。"所以保罗走到甲板上说："神对我说话了。"

他说，即使船会沉没，也不会有一个人丧生。现在，保罗相信这个，你知道为什么吗？在旧约中，如果你是一个先知，你做了一个预言，那个预言没有实现，先知会被处死，你知道为什么吗？

因为神的话总是可靠的。如果他真的给了你神的话，那么它必须实现。所以保罗绝对确信这是神的计划，绝对确定不会有人丧生。

但在《使徒行传》27章31节，结果水手决定他们要——你知道，风暴在继续，水手决定他们要偷偷离开船。所以他们开始上救生艇。当保罗看到水手试图离开船时，他告诉士兵阻止他们，他说："如果他们离开船，我们都会死。"

现在我相信这是伟大的陆军海军竞争的开始，实际上。但除此之外，这对我们来说没有意义，不是吗？等一下，我们会对保罗说："看，如果你真的相信没有人会丧生，如果这就是事情的样子，如果这是神的计划，那么谁在乎他们是否下船呢？"

谁在乎他们是否上救生艇，你知道，去浮潜，没关系。因为你看，我们相信如果它是固定的，它就是固定的，不管我们的选择如何，所以选择不重要。但看，保罗是这样的。

保罗对此有圣经的理解。我们的选择很重要，绝对重要，但它们不决定未来。因为它们很重要,他不是被动的。

所以他说："让我们按照我们应该做的方式做事。"但因为它们不决定未来，他不会瘫痪。他既不被动也不瘫痪。

随着2025年接近尾声，我们对未来的一年充满希望应该不足为奇。因为神正在做工，通过你帮助我们在播客、YouTube频道、广播节目、季刊和网站上提供的福音教导和资源，使人们来到信仰并更新基督徒。很快，通过我们的翻译项目，我们感激有这么多人与我们合作传播基督之爱的信息。

谢谢你。这继续为我们提供机会，扩展我们分享福音的方式。在2026年，我们预计增加新的国际广播节目和额外的在线事工合作伙伴关系，出版新书，并开始使凯勒博士的讲道可以用其他语言获得。所以在我们结束这一年时，我们邀请你认真考虑向《福音人生》作出年终捐赠。我们收到的年终礼物是我们如何为2026年的事工做准备的重要部分。

你的支持使我们能够与200多个国家的人分享福音的故事，我们对你参与这项使命深表感激。要做出年终捐赠，请访问gospelonlife.com-giv，即gospelonlife.com-giv。请祈祷我们能够很好地管理你的礼物，通过《福音人生》的事工，许多新的人会找到认识基督为救主的希望和喜乐。

感谢你与我们合作，与一个需要他的世界分享基督的爱，因为福音真正改变一切。现在，这里是凯勒博士带来今天信息的其余部分。

所以如果你相信一切都是固定的，不管我们的选择如何，你会是被动的。如果你相信我们的选择实际上决定了未来，那么你应该瘫痪。但他两者都不是。

## 蝴蝶效应与神的护理 / The Butterfly Effect and God's Providence

It's incredibly practical. And you say, well, why would he be paralyzed? I believe my choice is to determine the future, you know?

All the movies say so, back to the future, so. My choice is to determine the future. Well, you should be paralyzed.

Here's why. You know, there's a great story, short story by Ray Bradbury that you probably never read. But you've seen this, it's a short story called The Sound of Thunder.

But you've heard the storyline probably because it's been used on so many Star Trek's and Twilight Zones and all that sort of thing over the years. And The Sound of Thunder is about an illegal time machine. And a man named Travis, for a lot of money, will take people back in that illegal time machine to see the past.

And a man named Eccles comes to pay the money to go back into time machine. But Travis says, now, when you get into the past, I want you to realize there is going to be an anti-gravity metal path. It'll be six inches off the ground, it won't touch anything.

And though we're going back into the past to see how things are, you must not get off the path. You mustn't even touch a blade of grass. You must stay on the path.

And Eccles says, why? And here's what Travis says. He says, we'll say we accidentally kill a mouse, one mouse, by stepping on it.

That means all the future families are the families of the families of that one mouse with a stamp of your foot. You've annihilated a billion possible mice. They're all gone.

And what about the foxes that'll need those mice to survive? For one of ten mice, a fox dies. For one of ten foxes, a lion dies.

And eventually, some caveman goes out to hunt for food. But there is no food because you stepped on it. So the caveman stars, before having any children, and from his loins, would have sprung ten sons.

And from there, it's loins, tens, 100 sons, and thus, onward, a billion people, unborn, are throttled in the womb. Rome never rises on its seven hills. Step on a mouse and you crush the pyramids.

Washington never crosses a Delaware. There's never United States. So stay on the path, he says.

Never step off. And by the way, as you know, Eccles does step, maybe if you know the story, he does step off the path because he's too curious and he steps on a butterfly and it changes everything. So when they get back and Travis realizes he shoots him, what he did.

Wonderful story, huh? It's actually quite a powerful story, but here's, don't you understand what it's saying? Every single thing, every single thing in history is interlocked, interlaced in a million infinite number of ways in every little change.

You go this way or that way, changes everything. And if that was really completely determined by you, you haven't got the slightest bit. You don't have a millionth of the wisdom necessary to make those choices.

You have no idea what all they anticipated. You can't possibly anticipate all the changes. And what the Bible is trying to say, you don't have to.

You are absolutely responsible for your choices. You're a held responsible for them. They're free.

Nobody's forcing you to do them. If you make bad choices, there'll be bad consequences. But God is the one in charge of the future.

God is the one who's overruling everything. So you can do your best and then relax. You should be paralyzed if you really believed that your choices determine the future.

It would be the free will. If that was the case, it would be the most horrific gift. You shouldn't even get out of bed in the morning.

But it's not. Instead, what we can be sure of is all things work together for good to those who love God, even though it's very intricate. Now we hardly ever see how, but let me give you one example.

You know how we're here tonight? I was thinking of this example this week and you'll see why in a minute. I were here tonight.

There's a lot of reasons. All kinds of people have done so much to make this ministry and this church happen. But we could certainly say that it wouldn't be here if my wife and I've Kathy and I had not come to New York, you know, 18 years ago or so to start the church.

We wouldn't. None of this would be here. Well why?

What's the reason we came to New York to start the church? Because we joined a Presbyterian denomination that not only encouraged but gave us the freedom and had set a priority for church planning. Well why were we a member of that Presbyterian denomination?

Because my last year, my last semester in seminary, I took two courses with a professor that convinced me that I was theologically a Presbyterian and that's the reason I went into the denomination, that's the reason why I planted the church. But why did I take those two courses? Because at the very, very last minute, this man was able to come and teach those courses.

In spite of the fact it was a bureaucratic snag at the top that was keeping him from getting his visa, he was British. And the only reason why he came and taught those courses and the only reason why it changed my theological views and the only reason why I joined the Presbyterian denomination, the only reason why he was planted the church and the only reason why we're here tonight is because that bureaucratic snag was suddenly opened up at the last minute and he was able to get there in time to teach me those courses. Well what opened his snag?

What happened? And the answer is one morning the dean was praying and saying, I don't know how we're going to get this guy here in time to teach his courses this semester. And his prayer partner was a young man who was a student at my seminary at the time and he also happened to be one of the sons of the sitting president of the United States at the time who was Gerald Ford.

He was one of Gerald Ford's sons and he was a student there. And when he asked the dean what he was praying about and the dean told him, he says, well, you know, I have a name that you could talk to that might get you through the bureaucratic snag and it did, it worked, it worked. So why did he have the power to open that, to get rid of that snag so that man could come so I could have that course so I could change my views so I could join the Presbyterian Church so I could come and plant this church so we could be here tonight.

Because only because Nixon resigned, Gerald Ford never, ever, ever, ever been president unless Nixon resigned. But why did Nixon have to resign? Because of the Watergate scandal.

And why did the Watergate scandal happen? Because the people who were bugging the Democratic parties offices, those guys bugged it. But the night they bugged it, they left the door open.

And because a night watchman noticed that the door was unlashed, he went in and it was all discovered. Two inches. If that door had just been closed, two more inches, we wouldn't be here tonight.

Anything would have been changed. I have a question. Do you think that happened by accident that that guy kept the door open instead of closing it?

All he had to do was just pull it or turn around and say, I was at the door closed, he didn't. Do you think that happened by accident? And of course it's Ray Bradbury's right and he's right.

If that didn't happen by accident, nothing happens by accident. All things were together for good to those who loved God and called according to his purpose. Even Watergate happened for you.

And you know what? Ray Seldom, do we even get a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a glimpse of how God is working all things together for good to those who love God? But he is.

And therefore you can be assured that no matter what bad stuff is happening inside you and no matter how much bad stuff is happening outside you, he is not abandon you, he loves you.

这是非常实用的。你说："嗯，为什么他会瘫痪呢？我相信我的选择决定未来，你知道吗？"

所有的电影都这么说，《回到未来》之类的。我的选择决定未来。嗯，你应该瘫痪。

原因如下。你知道，有一个很棒的短篇故事，雷·布拉德伯里写的，你可能从来没有读过。但你见过这个，这是一个叫《雷霆之声》的短篇故事。

但你可能听说过这个故事情节，因为多年来它被用在很多《星际迷航》和《阴阳魔界》之类的节目中。《雷霆之声》是关于一个非法时间机器的。一个叫特拉维斯的人，用很多钱，会带人回到那个非法时间机器去看过去。

一个叫埃克尔斯的人来付钱去时间机器。但特拉维斯说："现在，当你进入过去时，我想让你意识到会有一条反重力金属路径。它会离地面六英寸，不会碰到任何东西。"

虽然我们要回到过去看看事情是怎样的，但你绝不能离开这条路径。你甚至不能碰一片草叶。你必须留在路径上。

埃克尔斯说："为什么？"特拉维斯是这样说的。他说："假设我们不小心杀死了一只老鼠，通过踩它杀死了一只老鼠。"

这意味着所有未来的家族都是那只老鼠的家族的家族。用你的一脚，你已经消灭了十亿只可能的老鼠。它们都消失了。

那些需要那些老鼠生存的狐狸怎么办？十只老鼠中有一只，一只狐狸就会死。十只狐狸中有一只，一只狮子就会死。

最终，某个穴居人出去打猎食物。但没有食物，因为你踩了它。所以穴居人挨饿，在生任何孩子之前就死了。从他的腰中，本会生出十个儿子。

从那里的腰中，数十个、数百个儿子，因此，往前推，十亿人，未出生的，在子宫中被扼杀了。罗马永远不会在它的七座山上升起。踩在老鼠上，你就粉碎了金字塔。

华盛顿永远不会渡过特拉华河。永远不会有美国。所以留在路径上，他说。

永远不要离开。顺便说一句，你知道，埃克尔斯确实踩了——也许如果你知道这个故事，他确实离开了路径，因为他太好奇了，他踩在一只蝴蝶上，改变了一切。所以当他们回来时，特拉维斯意识到他做了什么，就射杀了他。

很棒的故事，是吧？这实际上是一个非常有力的故事，但这里是，你不理解它在说什么吗？历史中的每一件事，每一件事都以百万种无限的方式在每一个小变化中交织在一起。

你走这条路或那条路，改变一切。如果这真的完全由你决定，你没有最轻微的一点。你没有百万分之一的智慧来做出那些选择。

你对所有这些都没有概念。你不可能预见所有的变化。圣经试图说的是，你不必这样。

你对你的选择绝对负责。你要为它们负责。它们是自由的。

没有人强迫你做它们。如果你做出错误的选择，会有不好的后果。但神是负责未来的那位。

神是凌驾一切的那位。所以你可以尽力而为，然后放松。如果你真的相信你的选择决定未来，你应该瘫痪。

那将是自由意志。如果是这样的话，那将是最可怕的礼物。你甚至不应该在早上起床。

但不是这样。相反，我们可以确信的是，万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处，尽管它非常复杂。现在我们几乎看不到如何运作，但让我给你一个例子。

你知道我们今晚怎么会在这里吗？我本周在思考这个例子，你一会儿就会明白为什么。我们今晚在这里。

有很多原因。所有这些人都做了很多工作来使这个事工和这个教会成为可能。但我们当然可以说，如果我和我的妻子凯西大约18年前没有来纽约开始这个教会，这一切都不会在这里。

我们不会。这一切都不会在这里。那么为什么？

我们来纽约开始教会的原因是什么？因为我们加入了一个长老会教派，它不仅鼓励而且给了我们自由，并设定了植堂的优先事项。那么我们为什么是那个长老会教派的成员？

因为我在神学院的最后一年，最后一个学期，我上了一位教授的两门课，这说服了我在神学上是一个长老会信徒，这就是我进入该教派的原因，这就是我植堂的原因。但我为什么上那两门课？因为在最后一刻，这个人能够来教那些课程。

尽管在上面有一个官僚障碍阻止他获得签证，他是英国人。他来教那些课程的唯一原因，它改变了我的神学观点的唯一原因，我加入长老会教派的唯一原因，他植堂的唯一原因，我们今晚在这里的唯一原因，是因为那个官僚障碍在最后一刻突然被打开了，他能够及时到达那里教我那些课程。那么是什么打开了他的障碍？

发生了什么？答案是一天早上，院长在祷告说："我不知道我们将如何让这个人及时到这里在这个学期教他的课程。"他的祷告伙伴是一个当时在我的神学院做学生的年轻人，他恰好也是当时在任的美国总统的儿子之一，就是杰拉尔德·福特。

他是杰拉尔德·福特的儿子之一，他是那里的学生。当他问院长他在祷告什么，院长告诉他时,他说:"好吧，你知道，我有一个你可以联系的名字，可能会让你通过官僚障碍。"它成功了,它成功了。所以他为什么有权力打开那个，摆脱那个障碍，这样那个人就可以来，这样我就可以上那门课，这样我就可以改变我的观点，这样我就可以加入长老会，这样我就可以来植这个教会，这样我们今晚就可以在这里。

仅仅因为尼克松辞职，杰拉尔德·福特永远、永远、永远、永远不会当总统，除非尼克松辞职。但尼克松为什么必须辞职？因为水门事件丑闻。

水门事件丑闻为什么会发生？因为窃听民主党办公室的人，那些人窃听了它。但他们窃听的那天晚上，他们让门开着。

因为一个夜间看守注意到门没有锁上，他进去了，一切都被发现了。两英寸。如果那扇门刚好再关上两英寸，我们今晚就不会在这里了。

任何事情都会改变。我有一个问题。你认为那个家伙让门开着而不是关上它是偶然发生的吗？

他所要做的就是把它拉过去或转身说："我在门关着的时候"，他没有。你认为这是偶然发生的吗？当然，雷·布拉德伯里是对的，他是对的。

如果这不是偶然发生的，没有什么是偶然发生的。万事都互相效力，叫爱神并按他旨意被召的人得益处。甚至水门事件也为你而发生。

你知道吗？罕见地，我们甚至得不到百万分之一的百万分之一的百万分之一的一瞥，看神如何使万事互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处？但他是。

因此，你可以确信，无论你内心发生什么糟糕的事情，无论你外面发生多少糟糕的事情，他没有抛弃你，他爱你。

## 将神的爱个人化在你里面 / Personalizing God's Love in You

Now, once you see not only that we can be assured and why we can be assured, finally how do we really make this operative in our lives? How?

And the reason we have to talk about this just for a second at least is there's lots of people walking around New York tonight who say, oh, I believe in a God of love. I believe that God loves everyone unconditionally. I believe He loves me no matter what I do, I believe He loves me.

But it's not changing their lives because it's abstract. Love is a kind of force and it's an abstract cognitive belief and it's not operative and their lives here is how this can change your life. You have to personalize it.

You have to personalize it two ways. You have to personalize the love of God in you and you have to personalize this assured love of God in Christ here. First of all, how to personalize it in you.

Now, here's what I mean by that. I just gave you a great little intellectual trope, I guess you call it. How do you deal with the fact of free will and the sovereignty of God?

Well, the antinomy, it's a parent contradiction, it's not a real contradiction. We don't have enough knowledge to understand how it works but it works that way. It's like light, waves and particles in that interesting.

That means that we are responsible and we have to do things and yet the same time God is totally in control and when it's all over, everything happens according to His will. Isn't that interesting? It's kind of a nice intellectual, you know, little structure, a way of understanding.

But I want you to apply it to you. I want you to personalize it right now. I want you to apply it to you yourself and your relationship with God.

Do you have a relationship with God? Have you gone to God through Jesus Christ? Now here's how it works.

And this is an old illustration but it's totally true. If you could think of a relationship with God as a door, as you're coming up to the door over the door, you see it say, Matthew 1032. Who so ever will confess me before men, I will confess before my father?

Who so ever will? In other words, as you're coming up to a relationship with God, what you're told is you've got to do it. You've got to make a decision.

You've got to make a commitment. You have things to do. You can't be passive.

But if you actually do and if you bite and if you say Lord accept me because of what Jesus has done and you actually open that door and you walk through it, the minute you walk through it, you turn around and you look and over the top is what is written John 1516, you have not chosen me, I have chosen you. And John 644, no man can come to me except the father draw him. And everybody who has ever actually moved through that door at some point realizes this, that in spite of all the work they did and all the commitment it took and all the, you might say in a sweat it took to make that commitment.

When you get in, you start to look back and say the reason that I'm a Christian is not because I'm more spiritual to other people, not because I'm more humble than other people, not because I'm more valiant for truth than other people. It's simply because God kept pushing and pressing and he persistently, persistently sought to love me till he broke me open to him. And therefore what makes me a Christian is simply, God came to me, not because I was smarter or better, not because I was more repentant, not because I was more spiritual in any way, it is free, absolutely free.

It is totally sovereign. Now what does this mean, I remember, when I was in college, I heard a minister speak on a text and I changed my life, he was speaking on Deuteronomy 7. And Deuteronomy 7 is this.

The Lord did not set his love upon you, O Israel, or choose you because you were the greatest of people, for you were the least of all people. No, it was because the Lord loved you that he brought you out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And I never forget the preacher said, do you see the logic there?

It says, God says, I didn't love you because you were greater, you were actually less. I didn't love you because of this, I didn't love you because of this, I brought you out of Egypt because I loved you. It's a circular argument.

I love you just because I love you, just because I love you. And then he says, and we were all college students and none of us were married, but we could understand. He says, let's apply this to your spouse.

If your spouse comes up to you and says, do you love me? And you say, yes. Your spouse will usually say, why?

Why do you love me? And he says, never say, well, you had such a sharper intellect than the other girls. You're really good looking.

You've got great career possibilities. You're just so much, we have so much fun together. You see, if you say, I love you because of this factor or that factor or this factor or that factor, the person's complete identity now shifts to that factor.

Because the fact factor is the basis for my value, that factor is what secures me love. But the minister says, the only way to answer a question, why do you love me is to say, honey, I love you just because I love you. And he says, that is not just weak talk, that is not just rhetoric, that is not just sweet, nothings.

He says, there is no other way for love to operate. But when God says that to you, when God says, I don't love you because you're more spiritual, you're more moral, you're more doctrinally sound, I love you just because I love you. And you love me only because I kept after you and after you and after you too, I finally broke you open.

That transforms, that transforms your identity why? Because finally, I don't have to be smart, I don't have to be sophisticated, I don't have to be make a lot of money, I don't have to be fun, I don't have to be good looking, those factors are gone. Finally, I'm love for myself.

And you see, if you know the reason why God loves you or people love you or your spouse loves you or anybody loves you because you have a great career, you will never be able to handle a reversal in that career. Or because you're so talented, you'll never be able to handle competition. Or because you're so anything, you'll never be able to handle failure.

But the divine, sovereign, electing grace of God, he loves you, just because he loves you. That will transform you. That person, have you personalized it?

现在，一旦你看到不仅我们可以得确据，为什么我们可以得确据，最后，我们如何真正使这在我们的生活中运作？如何？

我们必须谈论这个至少一秒钟的原因是，今晚有很多人在纽约四处走动，他们说："哦，我相信一个爱的神。我相信神无条件地爱每个人。我相信无论我做什么，他都爱我，我相信他爱我。"

但这并没有改变他们的生活，因为它是抽象的。爱是一种力量，它是一种抽象的认知信念，它不是运作的，他们的生活在这里是这个如何能够改变你的生活。你必须将它个人化。

你必须以两种方式将它个人化。你必须将神的爱在你里面个人化，你必须将这个确信的神的爱在基督里个人化。首先，如何在你里面将它个人化。

现在，我的意思是什么。我刚刚给了你一个很好的小智力比喻，我想你可以这样称呼它。你如何处理自由意志和神的主权这个事实？

好吧，悖论，这是一个表面上的矛盾，不是一个真正的矛盾。我们没有足够的知识来理解它是如何运作的，但它是以那种方式运作的。它像光一样，波和粒子，很有趣。

这意味着我们是有责任的，我们必须做事情，然而同时神是完全掌控的，当一切结束时，一切都按照他的意志发生。这不是很有趣吗？这是一个很好的智力，你知道，小结构，一种理解的方式。

但我想让你把它应用到你自己身上。我想让你现在就将它个人化。我想让你把它应用到你自己和你与神的关系上。

你与神有关系吗？你通过耶稣基督去到神那里了吗？现在，它是这样运作的。

这是一个古老的例证，但它是完全真实的。如果你能想象与神的关系就像一扇门，当你走到门口时，你看到门上写着《马太福音》10章32节："凡在人面前认我的，我在我父面前也必认他。"

凡愿意的！换句话说，当你走向与神的关系时，你被告知你必须做它。你必须做出决定。

你必须做出承诺。你有事情要做。你不能被动。

但如果你真的做了，如果你咬住，如果你说"主啊，因着耶稣所做的接纳我"，你真的打开那扇门，你走过它，你走过它的那一刻，你转身看，上面写的是《约翰福音》15章16节："不是你们拣选了我，是我拣选了你们。"和《约翰福音》6章44节："若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有能到我这里来的。"每个真正走过那扇门的人在某个时刻都意识到这一点，尽管他们做了所有的工作，所有需要的承诺，所有的，你可能会说是努力去做出那个承诺。

当你进去时，你开始回头看，说我之所以是基督徒的原因不是因为我比其他人更有灵性，不是因为我比其他人更谦卑，不是因为我比其他人更勇敢地追求真理。这仅仅是因为神不断推动和按压，他坚持不懈地、坚持不懈地寻求爱我，直到他把我打开给他。因此，使我成为基督徒的是，神来到我这里，不是因为我更聪明或更好，不是因为我更悔改，不是因为我在任何方面更有灵性，这是自由的，绝对自由的。

这是完全主权的。现在这意味着什么？我记得，当我在大学时，我听到一位牧师在一段经文上讲道，这改变了我的生活。他讲的是《申命记》第7章。《申命记》第7章是这样的。

耶和华专爱你们，拣选你们，并非因你们的人数多于别民，原来你们的人数在万民中是最少的。只因耶和华爱你们，所以用大能的手将你们从埃及领出来。我永远不会忘记那位传道人说："你看到这里的逻辑了吗？"

它说，神说："我爱你不是因为你更大，你实际上更小。我爱你不是因为这个，我爱你不是因为这个，我把你从埃及领出来是因为我爱你。"这是一个循环论证。

我爱你只是因为我爱你，只是因为我爱你。然后他说，我们都是大学生，我们都没有结婚，但我们能理解。他说："让我们把这应用到你的配偶身上。"

如果你的配偶来到你面前说："你爱我吗？"你说:"是的。"你的配偶通常会说："为什么？"

为什么你爱我？他说，永远不要说："嗯，你的智力比其他女孩更敏锐。你真的很好看。"

你有很好的职业前景。你只是如此，我们在一起有这么多乐趣。看，如果你说，我爱你是因为这个因素或那个因素或这个因素或那个因素，这个人的完整身份现在转移到那个因素。

因为那个因素是我价值的基础，那个因素是保证我的爱的东西。但牧师说，回答"为什么你爱我"这个问题的唯一方法是说："亲爱的，我爱你只是因为我爱你。"他说，这不只是软弱的话，这不只是修辞，这不只是甜言蜜语。

他说，爱没有其他方式运作。但当神对你说那话时，当神说："我爱你不是因为你更有灵性，你更道德，你在教义上更正确，我爱你只是因为我爱你。你爱我只是因为我不断追求你，追求你，追求你，直到我最终把你打开。"

这会转变，这会转变你的身份。为什么？因为最终，我不必聪明，我不必老练，我不必赚很多钱，我不必有趣，我不必好看，这些因素都消失了。最终，我因为我自己而被爱。

你看，如果你知道神爱你或人们爱你或你的配偶爱你或任何人爱你的原因是因为你有一个伟大的事业，你将永远无法处理那个事业的逆转。或者因为你如此有才华，你将永远无法处理竞争。或者因为你如此任何东西，你将永远无法处理失败。

但神圣的、主权的、拣选的恩典，他爱你，只是因为他爱你。这将转变你。那个人，你将它个人化了吗？

## 将神的爱个人化在基督里 / Personalizing God's Love in Christ

So you have to personalize it for you, but then secondly, you have to personalize it in Jesus. What do I mean by that? People say, oh, I believe God loves me, nothing can separate me from the love of God.

Oh, I believe that, but don't think of love abstractly, Jesus is the love of God. In the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, you know what was happening? All the greatest forces in the universe were arrayed against Jesus.

And he could have stopped them. He could have stopped the rejection. He could have stopped the torture.

He could have stopped the death. He could have stopped the rejection of his father. He could have stopped the eternal justice coming down on his head.

All he had to do was give up on us. That's all he had to do. Just walk away.

Charles Spurgeon, I think it was, who said, Jesus Christ was up on the cross, nailing, bleeding, dying, looking down at the people betraying him and forsaking him, and denying him. And in the greatest act of love in the history of the universe, he stayed. Bomb after bomb after bomb was coming down on Jesus Christ trying to get him to drop us, to separate him from us.

See? And even hell itself couldn't do it. He stayed.

Nothing could separate him from us. His love from us. He held on to us.

He was our savior. He died for us. Now that's how you know nothing can separate you from the love of God.

It's not an abstraction. Just say, oh, I just believe that God loves me unconditionally. Oh no.

He loves you counter-conditionally. He loves you against conditions because of Jesus. When you see Jesus Christ never let you go no matter what came down on him, that's how you know.

And that's the only way you really know absolutely certain that no matter what you do inside, no matter what is bad is happening on the outside, he has not abandoned you. If he wouldn't abandon you then, he wouldn't abandon you now. If he wouldn't abandon you when hell itself was coming down on him.

And if that didn't separate his love from you, do you think you having a bad week is going to do it? Do you think there's anything you could do that could destroy his love for you when that couldn't do it? Or when bad things are happening to you all over and you say, oh, I must be abandoned.

If he didn't abandon you there, he's not going to abandon you now. He spared not himself. The father spared not his own son.

And if he wouldn't spare that, if he wouldn't spare that, he gave us the ultimate gift. Do you think in some how he's going to let your life go off the rails now? He's not going to deny you anything you need.

If somebody spends a billion dollars on your present, do you think he's going to skimp on the wrapping paper? This is the love you've been looking for all your life. No friend love, no married love, no popular acclaim, no parental love will give you what this will give you.

Psalms 27, 10 says, though, my mother and father forsake me, the Lord will bear me up. Your mother and father will forsake you. Even if you have the best mother and father in the world, they're going to die.

But nothing, nothing, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor anything to come, nor height, nor death, nor anything in all creation, will be able to separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus or our Lord. Are you certain of that? You can be.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving to us this great assurance. And we pray that you would help us make it operative in our lives.

And the Lord suffers a time to do that. Meet us now as we take these concrete elements into our hands. And as we give ourselves to you because we know that you gave yourself to us and we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

所以你必须为你将它个人化，但然后第二，你必须在耶稣里将它个人化。我的意思是什么？人们说："哦，我相信神爱我，没有什么能使我与神的爱隔绝。"

哦，我相信那个，但不要抽象地想爱，耶稣就是神的爱。在客西马尼园和在十字架上，你知道发生了什么吗？宇宙中所有最伟大的力量都排列起来对抗耶稣。

他本可以阻止它们。他本可以阻止拒绝。他本可以阻止酷刑。

他本可以阻止死亡。他本可以阻止他父亲的拒绝。他本可以阻止永恒的公义降临在他的头上。

他所要做的就是放弃我们。这就是他所要做的。只要走开。

我想是司布真说的，耶稣基督在十字架上，被钉着，流血，死去，俯视那些背叛他、离弃他、否认他的人。在宇宙历史上最伟大的爱的行动中，他留了下来。一颗又一颗炸弹降落在耶稣基督身上，试图让他放弃我们，使他与我们分离。

看到了吗？甚至地狱本身也做不到。他留了下来。

没有什么能使他与我们分离。他对我们的爱。他抓住我们。

他是我们的救主。他为我们而死。现在这就是你如何知道没有什么能使你与神的爱隔绝。

这不是一个抽象概念。只是说："哦，我只是相信神无条件地爱我。"哦不。

他是反条件地爱你。他是违背条件爱你，因为耶稣。当你看到耶稣基督永远不会让你离开，无论什么降临在他身上，这就是你如何知道的。

这是你真正知道的唯一方式，绝对确定，无论你内心做什么，无论外面发生什么糟糕的事情，他没有抛弃你。如果他那时不会抛弃你，他现在也不会抛弃你。如果当地狱本身降临在他身上时他不会抛弃你。

如果那不能使他对你的爱分离，你认为你过了糟糕的一周会做到吗？你认为你能做任何事情能够摧毁他对你的爱，当那都做不到的时候？或者当糟糕的事情到处发生在你身上，你说："哦，我一定被抛弃了。"

如果他在那里没有抛弃你，他现在也不会抛弃你。他没有怜惜自己。父没有怜惜他自己的儿子。

如果他不怜惜那个，如果他不怜惜那个，他给了我们终极的礼物。你认为他会让你的生活现在脱轨吗？他不会否认你需要的任何东西。

如果有人在你的礼物上花了十亿美元，你认为他会在包装纸上吝啬吗？这就是你一生都在寻找的爱。没有朋友的爱，没有婚姻的爱，没有流行的赞誉，没有父母的爱会给你这个能给你的东西。

《诗篇》27章10节说:"我父母离弃我，耶和华必收留我。"你的父母会离弃你。即使你有世界上最好的父母，他们也会死去。

但没有什么，没有什么，无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事，是高处的，是死亡，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝，这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。你确信这一点吗？你可以的。

让我们祷告。天父，感谢你给我们这个伟大的确据。我们祈求你帮助我们使它在我们的生活中运作。

求主有时间来做到这一点。当我们将这些具体的元素拿在手中时，遇见我们。当我们把自己交给你时，因为我们知道你把自己交给了我们，我们奉耶稣的名祷告，阿门。
