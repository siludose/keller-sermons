## 奴役的悖论 / The Paradox of Slavery

You think it's doing something for you, and it is doing something for you. But you have offered yourself to it. You've offered yourself.

You've given yourself. You're under its control. You're being controlled by it.

It's a spiritual master. How so? The answer would be.

And Paul's answer, and those of you who've been around me for a while, or heard this teaching before, no, there's always a... Whenever I'm talking about this subject, there's a Greek verb somewhere nearby, the same Greek verb, and here it is. It's in verse 12.

He says, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Don't let sin reign. See, there's spiritual masters.

You're going to be a slave to something. And whatever it is that you have given yourself to, whatever you've offered yourself to, is controlling you through, quote, evil desires. Now, let's be real sympathetic to the translators.

There's a Greek word here that is very hard to translate. In the Old King James Bible, it was usually translated lust to the flesh. The trouble is that that's actually literally not a bad translation.

For you and me today, lust to the flesh means sex, and this isn't talking about sexuality. And it doesn't actually say. There's the word thumia in it, and that means desires or drive.

But the prefix to the word is epithumia, which means an overdrive or an over-desire. This is not talking about desire for bad things. It's talking about an ordinate desire for good things.

And that is how you lose control. There's good things in your life that you've made into ultimate things, and they control your life, because if they really are, your means of significance. So they really are.

You mean security. You've got to have them. You've got to have them.

And therefore, they control you through an ordinate desires. Let me give you three tests. Let me give you three kinds of epi desires, three kinds of an ordinate desires.

That will show you where your spiritual masters are. The first one would be anger. If something blocks you're getting a good thing, you get angry.

But if something blocks you getting an ultimate thing, something you've based your life on, you get epi angry. You lose it. You say things you afterwards.

I don't know why I said that. You blow up, or you get incredibly bitter. Are you having trouble forgiving anybody?

Are you having trouble forgiving somebody at the root of it is a spiritual master that's controlling you through an over desire for something? Wait a minute. So you start to say, wow, this really starts to make me rethink my life.

That's the point. Let me give you a second test. Fear.

If something good is threatened, something good in your life is threatened. You're worried. But if something ultimate in your life is threatened, you're paralyzed with fear.

Absolutely fall apart. You can't control your anxiety. Are you so anxious that you can't think straight?

It's something that so makes you afraid that you know you're being driven by it. It's because some spiritual master, something, is enslaving you. And it's controlling you.

It's directing you, or a third test, of course, would be sadness. If you lose something good, you grieve, you weep, it's terrible. It takes months to get over it.

If you lose something that's ultimate, you want to throw yourself off a bridge. You want to throw yourself off a bridge. You don't feel there's no meaning in life.

Martin Luther, in his larger catechism, brilliant piece of work, expounds the first commandment. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And in his exposition, he points out that the first commandment is the basis for all the other commandments.

He says, you never do anything else wrong in your life. You never do anything else wrong. You don't get over angry, over afraid, or over despondent.

You don't lie, you don't kill, you don't steal, you don't do anything else wrong. Unless first, you're committing this sin. Something you've set up as an idol in your life, and that's the reason for everything that happens in your life.

It's the underlying factor in everything. If you have an eating disorder, you've offered yourself to the god of thinness. At some deep level, your heart is said, if I have thinness, if I look like that, then I'll be okay.

If you're a workaholic, if you overwork, and you know you're overwork, you've made a covenant as you've offered yourself to the god of money or status or achievement. There's very many different ways for that. If you're in a relationship, and you know, and everybody knows, it's really a bad relationship.

But you can't give it up. You can't give it up. You've made an idol out of male or female affection.

You just can't imagine not being with somebody. These things got you, and here's what Paul is saying. Everybody in the world has got spiritual masters.

No one in the world is free. You think you're in control. You think you're your own person, and you're not.

And until you get rid of that illusion, you'll never make the changes that you need to make in your life. And so you see his first answer to the question. When a person says, well, you know, if it's all by grace and you know, why do gods will?

Why not do my own will? He says, if you say, why not live any way I want? You are comically.

You are fatally naive about how the human heart works. If you're not doing gods will, if you're not given wholly to him, you're absolutely out of control. And everyone's shape is different.

Everyone's spiritual masters are different. So the first step in any kind of major change is to understand yourself, and you have to recognize the shape of your particular spiritual service. Number one, number two.

Secondly, and two and three go together, but secondly, if you're going to get the resources that Christ gives you to change, you have to realize the scope and the breadth of the cosmic unity you have with him. The heart of this passage, this chapter in these whole three chapters, are in these verses up here, verse three to five. Don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ, Jesus who are baptized into his death in verse five, if we've been united with him in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.

Now, first of all, who's he talking about? He's talking about the baptized, and what does that mean? And it's just his way of saying that converted.

Who are the baptized? These are the people who have given their lives to Christ. Baptism is sort of like the wedding ring.

It's one thing to fall in love to somebody. It's another thing to give your life to the person. It's one thing to be in love.

It's another thing to commit yourself, and that's the ring that's baptism. And so when he talks about baptism, he's not talking about super Christians, or he's talking about everybody who's really given their lives to Jesus. What is true of these people?

Verse five, they are united. We are united to him. And that word united is a strange word, actually.

你以为它是在为你做些什么，实际上你在向它奉献自己。你已经把自己交给了它，被它控制了。这是一种精神上的主人。为什么？

答案就是这个希腊动词。那些听我演讲久一点的人，或者听过这堂课的人，知道每当谈到这个问题时，总有一个希腊动词在附近。这里就是那个词，在第12节中。他说：“不要让罪恶在你们的肉身中掌权，以至于顺从它的欲望。

” 不要让罪恶掌权。你看，这就是精神上的主人。你会成为某种东西的奴隶。你所奉献给的东西，无论是什么，都是通过“邪恶的欲望”来控制你的。

让我们对翻译者表示同情。这里有一个希腊词很难翻译。在旧钦定本圣经中，它通常被译为“肉欲的淫念”。问题在于，这个翻译其实并不差。

对我们和你们今天来说，“肉欲的淫念”意味着性行为，但这并不是在谈论性。而且经文里并没有直接提到这个词。其中包含一个词thumia，意思是欲望或驱动力。但这个词前缀是epithumia，意思是过度的欲望或过分的驱动力。

这并不是指对坏事的欲望，而是指对好事的一种正当的欲望。而正是这种正当的欲望让你失去控制。你生活中有好的东西，却把它们当作终极目标，从而控制了你的生活，因为如果这些是你生命的意义所在，那么它们就是真的对你有意义。你追求的是安全感。

你需要拥有这些东西。你需要拥有它们。因此，它们通过一种正当的欲望来控制你。让我给你三个测试。

我将给出三种类型的epi欲望或正当欲望。这会告诉你你的精神导师是谁。第一个是愤怒。如果某件事阻碍了你得到一个好东西，你会生气。

但如果某件事阻碍了你得到一个终极目标——你生命的基础，你会变得epi愤怒。你会失去理智。你会说出事后后悔的话。我不知道自己为什么这么说。

你会大发雷霆，或者变得极其怨恨。你有没有发现很难原谅别人？这背后的原因是某种精神导师通过过度的欲望控制着你。让我再给你第二个测试：恐惧。

如果某件好事受到威胁——生活中的一件好事受到威胁，你会感到担忧。但如果生活中最重要的东西受到威胁，你会被恐惧彻底击垮。你无法控制自己的焦虑。你是否如此焦虑以至于无法集中思想？

这让你害怕到你知道自己是被它驱使的。这是因为某种精神导师或某个事物在奴役着你，并控制着你。它是在测试你，或者第三个测试是悲伤。如果你失去了一件好事，你会悲伤、哭泣，那真是糟糕透了。

这需要几个月的时间才能恢复过来。如果你失去了生命中最重要的东西，你会想要从桥上跳下去。你会觉得生活中没有意义。马丁·路德在他的《大要理问答》中，这篇杰出的作品，阐述了第一条诫命：“除了我以外，你不可有别的神。

”在对这条诫命的解释中，他指出，第一条诫命是所有其他诫命的基础。他说，在你的一生中，你从没有做过任何错事。你从没有生气、害怕或沮丧过。你从不撒谎，从不杀人，从不偷窃，你从不做任何错事。

除非首先，你在生活中树立了一个偶像，这是你生活中一切事情的原因所在。这就是一切的根源。如果你有饮食障碍，你就把自己献给了瘦削之神。在某个深层次上，你的内心认为，如果我瘦了，如果我看起来像那样，我就没事了。

如果你是个工作狂，过度工作，并且你知道自己是在过度工作，你已经与金钱、地位或成就签订了契约，将自己献给了这些神明。有多种不同的方式。如果你处于一段关系中，你知道，大家都知道这段关系真的不好。但是你无法放手。

你已经将男性或女性的爱变成了你的偶像。你根本无法想象没有某个人的生活。这些事情在困扰着你，而保罗在这里说：世界上每个人都有一位精神导师。世界上没有人是自由的。

你以为自己在掌控一切。你以为你是自己的人，但其实不是。直到你摆脱了这种错觉，你才不会做出你需要在生活中改变的事情。所以你看他的第一个回答。

当一个人说：“好吧，既然一切都是恩典，为什么神要这样安排？为什么不按照我的意愿来？”他说：“如果你说：‘为什么我不可以随心所欲地生活？’那你真是可笑。

” 您对人性的内心世界有着致命的天真。如果您没有遵行神的心意，如果没有完全归属祂，您就是绝对失控的。而且每个人都有不同的形状。每个人的灵性导师都是不同的。

因此，在任何重大改变的第一步是了解自己，并且要认识到自己的灵性服务的独特形态。第一点，第二点。其次，第二点和第三点紧密相连，但首先，如果您想获得基督赐给您的改变资源，您必须意识到与祂之间宇宙性的合一范围之广袤。这段经文的核心，在于这一章乃至这三章中的这些节次——从第三节到第五节。

难道你们不知道，凡浸洗归入基督耶稣的人，按照第五节所说，若与祂同死，也必与祂同活吗？首先，他指的是谁？是那些受洗的人，那又意味着什么呢？这就是祂说的“被转化”的人。

哪些人是受洗的呢？这些人是已经将生命献给基督的人。洗礼就像婚戒一样。坠入爱河是一件事，而将生命奉献给某个人又是另一回事。

坠入爱河是一件事情，而全心投入则是另一回事，这就是婚戒所象征的意义——洗礼。因此，当他提到受洗时，并不是指超凡的基督徒，而是指那些真正将生命献给耶稣的人。这些人的哪些特质是真实的呢？第五节说，他们是被联合的。

我们与祂同在。这个“联合”一词其实很特别。这是一个园艺术语，意味着我们已经被嫁接到主的生命之根上。根部。

## 与基督联合 / United with Christ

It's a horticultural word, and it means that we've been engrafted into the root. The root. Not engrafted up here, even though there's other places in the Bible that talk about that.

The metaphor is trying to say that our life has been inserted into the very roots of his life. What does that mean? Well, look at verse five, we have been united to the past and the future of Jesus Christ.

Jesus past is now our past. Jesus future is not our future. That's what it's saying.

I have a whole series to unpack this, but just give me a couple minutes right now. First of all, it says, we died in him. Our past is his past.

What's that mean? Remember, I mentioned that Colossians three is another place where Paul goes into this, even more succinctly, and in Colossians three, he says, you have been raised with Christ, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, set your mind on things above. For you died and your life is now hid with Christ in God.

You died in him, you're raised in him, you're seated at the right hand of God in him. What's that mean? Here's what it means.

Imagine a person who has become rich, and how did he or she become rich? Here she became rich through the brilliance and the diligence of effort. So, riches came to this person through the brilliance and diligence of effort, their efforts.

But now they get married. How does all those riches come to the new spouse? Through legal union by grace.

The one person has done everything in order to bring all this wealth, bring all this wealth and mass this wealth. But the second person just gets married. Legal union by grace, like that.

This is telling you this, why is Jesus Christ at the right hand of the Father? That's a place of honor. That's where you put the prime minister.

That's where you put the returning conquering general. You know why he's at the right hand of the Father? Look at what he's accomplished.

Look at his life. Look at the nobility and the goodness and the greatness and the courage of what he's done. And the Father looks at the Son and his heart literally bursts with delight.

And this text is saying that everything Jesus Christ has done is now legally true of you. The determining factor in your relationship with God is no longer your past but Christ's past. And the Father dotes on you and accepts you and delights in you and sees you as having all the beauty and the greatness and the glory of his Son.

He sees you as a free from condemnation for the guilt of your sins as if you had died yourself and already paid the penalty for all your sins. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the Songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start. And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him.

We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional is our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give that's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr.

Keller with the rest of today's teaching. That's the first thing where United Christ passed but notice in verse five it also says we will certainly be united in his resurrection. See that certainly it doesn't say conditional.

Now if you really live a good life and you come to church and you come to Redeemer and take notes on Tim and Keller's servants, you certainly will be you know it doesn't say anything like that. It says you you certainly period. What that means is there's an indesoluble connection.

The moment you believe with the future of Jesus Christ you are already connected to him. What does this mean? Well there's a there's a fascinating Greek word that shows up twice in the Bible.

It's a philosophical term and it's a term that's the name of the term is Palingenesia. You hear the word Genesis in there and it actually means the rebirth of the cosmos, the rebirth of the cosmos. And it came from stoic philosophy that believed that of course history was an endless cycle and that the world would get worse and worse and worse and and there would be decay and it would be brokenness and every so often the stoics believed there would be a purging and a great fire would come and cleanse everything and purify everything and take away the old and make everything new and fresh again and history was saw all over.

That was the view of the stoics. Endlessly enlist cyclical Palingenesia's birth and rebirth and rebirth and rebirth. Oh, what do we believe as Christians?

Here's what we believe. In Matthew chapter 1928, Jesus Christ takes that word and deliberately uses it in the most startling and astonishing way. He says in 1928 he says at the Palingenesia and it's usually translated at the renewal of all things.

When the son of man sits on his glorious throne everyone who has lost houses or brothers or sisters or fathers or mothers or children or fields for my sake will receive 100 times as much an eternal life for many who are first will be last and the last will be first. Jesus says there will be a Palingenesia but one the there is a single point at which all of history toward which all of history is flowing at which everything sat will become untrue. Everything will be purged.

Everything will become new and everything will dance and everything will be in fullness and wholeness. And what fire is strong enough? What power is life giving enough to do such a thing?

And the answer is when Jesus Christ puts forth his royal power when this is when the son of man sits on his glorious throne in the future. The entire world is going to be purged. Everything will be reborn.

Cosmic rebirth, everything sat will come untrue. History itself will be changed. Isn't that amazing?

I'll tell you what's more amazing. That word shows up one more time in the Bible and an even more surprising place. In Titus chapter 3 verse 5, Paul is talking about our salvation, our personal salvation.

And he says, Jesus saved us not because of righteous things we have done, but through the washing of rebirth through the Holy Spirit. Do you know what that word rebirth is? It's the word Palingenesia.

And it's totally inappropriate, at least at first glance. Because Palingenesia is talking about cosmic rebirth, not personal renewal, but do you know what Paul is saying? Paul is saying, the minute you become a Christian, the Holy Spirit comes into your life, we understand, right?

But now do you understand what this is saying? The power of the future, the power of that future transcendent order, that absolute ultimate life giving power that someday going to regenerate the entire cosmos comes into your life and begins to work now. And therefore, when we say, if it's all of grace, why live a good life?

Paul says, you have a slightest idea what's happened to you, have you? He didn't just get a get out of jail free card, you didn't just get a pardon? You were united to everything in Christ past and everything in Christ's future.

And you know what this means? You know, when you and I come, in fact me too, when I came to Christ, when you come to Christ, when anybody comes to Christ, we come with the most unbelievably small ambitions, we want inner peace. We want a little reorientation, we want a little pickup, we want, you know, to feel like our life matters, you know, we want some inspiration, you know.

But boy, boy, there's a lot more to it than that. For Kathy and me, this passage out of mere Christianity by C. S.

Lewis has been a life shaping, quote, listen, Lewis says, imagine yourself as a house. God comes into rebuild it. At first, you can understand what he's doing, getting the drains right, stopping the leaks and the roof, and so on.

You know those jobs needed doing and so you were not surprised. But presently, he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is he up to?

The answer is he is throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making court yards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage. But he is building a palace.

He intends to come and live in it himself. If we let him, he will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a dazzling, radiant immortal creatures pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine. A bright, stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly, though of course on a smaller scale, his own boundless power and delight and goodness.

The process will be long and in parts painful, but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. If becoming a Christian means union with Christ, I suggest two things.

Get rid of your low goals. Get rid of all your goals. Get rid of your low goals and get rid of your your goals.

Get rid of your low goals. Instead of saying, what I am trying to say is people so often say, well, if I become a Christian, what I have to stop doing that, will I still be able to do that? Anticipate that you will not be able to anticipate the magnitude of the changes that when they begin to come, you will be so grateful for.

不是嫁接在这里面，虽然圣经中其他地方也有提到这一点。这个比喻试图说明我们的生命已经嵌入到耶稣生命的根源之中。**这意味着什么呢？看看第五节，我们与耶稣基督的过去和未来是联合在一起的。**

耶稣的过去现在就是我们的过去。耶稣的未来并不是我们的未来。这就是它所要表达的意思。我有一系列的内容要来解释这个，但先给我几分钟时间。

首先，它说我们在他里面死了。我们的过去就是他的过去。这什么意思？记得我在提到歌罗西书第三章时也提到了这一点，并且在那里保罗说得更为简洁。

在歌罗西书第三章中，他说：“你们与基督一同复活了，已经和基督一同坐在天上；你们死在过犯和罪孽之中，如今与基督一同藏在神里面。” 我们在他里面死了，在他里面复活，现在与基督一同坐在天上的位置。这又意味着什么呢？想象一个人变得富有，他是怎么变得富有的呢？

是通过他的聪明才智和勤奋努力。所以财富是通过他的聪明才智和勤奋努力得来的。但现在这个人结婚了，这些财富是如何转移到新配偶身上的呢？是通过合法的婚姻关系，就像恩典一样。

一个人通过自己的努力积累了所有的财富，但另一个人只是通过婚姻关系就拥有了这一切。这就是为什么耶稣基督在父神的右边，那是荣耀的位置——你把首相放在那里，把凯旋归来的将军放在那里。他为什么在父神的右边？是因为看他所成就的一切。

看他的生命，看他的高贵、善良、伟大和勇敢。父神看着儿子，心里充满了喜悦。这段经文正是说，耶稣基督所做的每一件事现在都合法地属于你了。决定你与神关系的因素不再是你的过去而是基督的过去。

父神疼爱你，接纳你，并以极大的喜悦看待你，视你为拥有他儿子的一切美丽、伟大和荣耀。他视你为因信耶稣基督的死而得释放，不再受罪孽的定罪。你的罪孽仿佛是你自己已经死了，并且为你付上了赎罪的代价。诗篇可以深刻地塑造你与神交往的方式。

甚至在面对死亡时，耶稣也依靠诗篇来应对每一个情况。在提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的《365日灵修》中，《耶稣之歌》，你会找到每天通过诗篇的新颖圣经见解。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式。而如果你已经花时间研读和祷告，那么阅读并祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和疑问呈现在神面前，并发现与祂更深的亲密关系。

作为您对福音和生命传播耶稣之爱的支持，我们将赠送您提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的灵修书籍。请访问gospelandlife.com/give获取您的副本。现在，请听基勒博士今天的教导继续。正如经文第五节所说，我们确实会在基督的复活中联合起来。

注意这里说的是“确实”，而不是条件。如果你真的过着良好的生活，并且来教会、来赎罪堂参加提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的服侍，你当然会被联结到祂身上。这并不意味着任何条件性的说法。它说的就是“你已经”被联结了。

**这意味着什么？圣经中有一个非常有趣的希腊词出现了两次。**这是一个哲学术语，也是这个术语的名字叫Palingenesia。你听到里面有个词Genesis（创世记），实际上它的意思是宇宙的重生、宇宙的重生。

这个词源自斯多葛派哲学，他们认为当然历史是一个无尽的循环，世界会变得越来越糟，会有衰败和破灭，而斯多葛派相信每隔一段时间就会有一次净化，一场大火会来净化一切、净化一切，并带走旧的一切，使一切都焕然一新。这是斯多葛派的观点。宇宙不断重生和再重生，那么作为基督徒，我们相信什么呢？这就是我们的信仰。

在马太福音19章28节，耶稣基督故意用这个词，在最令人震惊和惊异的方式使用了它。他说：“在Palingenesia（重生）的时候”，通常被译为“万物更新”的时候。当人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上时，所有为了我的缘故而失去房屋、兄弟姐妹、父亲母亲、儿女或田地的人，都会获得百倍的回报，并且得到永生。许多原本是第一的将会变成最后，许多原本是最后的将会成为第一。

耶稣说会有Palingenesia（重生），但在某个特定的时刻，所有历史都将变得不再真实。一切将被净化。一切都将成为新的，一切都将欢腾，一切都将充满完整和丰满。什么火焰足够强大？

什么力量给予生命足以做到这一切？答案是：当耶稣基督展示出他的王权，当人子坐在他荣耀的宝座上时，在未来，整个世界都将被净化、重生。宇宙的重生，一切都会变得不再真实。历史本身将被改变。

这不是很令人惊叹吗？更令人惊奇的是，这个词在圣经中出现了一次，而且是在一个更加意想不到的地方。提多书第三章第五节，保罗在谈论我们的救赎，个人的救赎。他这样说：“我们是因着他的恩典得救，并不是因为行为上的义，乃是因着信主耶稣基督的洗。

”你知道这个“重生”是什么意思吗？这个词叫Palingenesia。乍一看，这似乎不太合适。因为Palingenesia指的是宇宙的重生，而不是个人的更新，但你知道保罗在说什么吗？

保罗说，当你成为基督徒的一刻，圣灵就进入你的生命中了，你们懂了吗？但是现在你们明白这句话的意思了吗？未来的强大力量，超越现世的秩序的力量，那赋予绝对终极生命的强大能力，有一天会再生整个宇宙，现在就已经进入了你的生命并开始运作。所以当我们说一切都是恩典时，为什么还要过好生活呢？

保罗说，你有没有想过发生了什么？他不只是给了你们一张“免罪卡”，不是只赦免了你们的罪吗？你们与基督过去的一切和未来的一切都联合在一起了。你知道这意味着什么吗？

我们知道，当你和我来到基督面前，事实上也是我，当你来到基督面前，当任何人来到基督面前时，我们怀着最不可思议的小愿望：我们想要内心的平静。我们想要一点点重新定向，想要一点点提升，我们希望感觉自己的生命有意义，**我们需要一些灵感。**但天哪，这远远不止这些。对于凯西和我来说，《基督教的常理》一书中的这段话对我们的人生产生了深远的影响，引用一下，听我说，路易斯说：“想象你自己是一栋房子，上帝进来要重建它。

起初你能理解他在做什么：疏通下水道，堵住漏水的地方，修好屋顶等等。这些工作需要做，所以你并不感到惊讶。但不久之后，他开始以一种极其痛苦且毫无道理的方式摇晃这栋房子。他在干什么？

天哪，这是什么意思？” 答案是，他正在这里建新的翼楼，在那里加一层，建造塔楼，开辟庭院。你以为你会变成一座体面的小别墅。但他是在建造一座宫殿。

他打算自己住进去。如果我们让他这么做，他会把我们中最软弱、最肮脏的人变成闪耀着光芒的不朽生物，充满如此的能量、喜悦、智慧和爱——我们现在都无法想象。一面明亮无瑕的镜子，完美地反射出上帝无穷的力量、欢乐和善良，当然只是在较小的尺度上。这个过程将会漫长且部分痛苦，但这正是我们在所面临的。

没有比这更少了。如果成为基督徒意味着与基督联合，我建议两件事。抛弃你的低目标。抛弃你所有的目标。

## 超越想象的自由 / Freedom Beyond Imagination

But they are way beyond anything that you could ever dare ask or think. Nor, when you are getting started, is your mind open enough and alive enough and that, frankly, spiritually smart enough to know what it is you need. So first of all, you have to recognize the shape of your spiritual slavery.

Secondly, you have to begin to grasp the scope and the breadth of your cosmic unity with him. But lastly, you must, and here is the secret, you must live daily out of your new identity. You must live daily out of your new identity.

And two verses that tell you about that, right here, verse six, we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. Our old self, that's your former self, your old identity, crucified. It's a past tense.

It's perfect. It's done. Your old self, your former self is gone.

When you become a Christian, you're not the same person. So your old identity is gone. You've got a new identity.

So that, and it's out of this identity that the body of sin might be done away with. Now, that doesn't mean your body, your physical body is sinful. What it's trying to say is your body under the reign of your spiritual masters.

Do you see the rest of the sentence? It means your life, your actions, your body is the thing that Paul is using it as a way of talking about the way you actually live in the world, your actions, your decisions. Through your new identity, you have the ability to break the reign of your old spiritual masters in how you actually live.

That's what verse six is saying. But in verse 11 says, though, the identity is the secret. Look at verse 11.

It doesn't happen automatically. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin. You are dead to sin.

You are alive to God, but you've got to treat yourself as dead to sin and life to God. You've got to remind yourself of who you are. In verse 12 says, therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey.

It's evil desires. And that simply means this. On the one hand, if you're not changing in the ways you need to change, you don't lack any resources if you're a Christian.

You got them all. You got everything you need. On the other hand, they need to be deployed and they don't happen automatically.

If you ever fail to live as you should, if you ever fail to change, you're not remembering who you really are. You're not conscious of who you really are. You've forgotten who you are in Jesus.

That's the point. That's the key. And let me close with three questions, which of course I'll unravel over the next few weeks.

Because as soon as you hear that, here's three questions. How does that work? Why does it take so long?

And why is that so hard? How does it work? Now, some of you know that one of my favorite examples of this is Augustin.

Santa Augustin, to put it mildly, before he was a Christian, had a problem with sexual self-control. But after he became a Christian one day, he was walking along and one of his old mistresses showed up. And she came after him.

She was one of the people he was particularly attracted to. And she wanted to pull them off into a fling, which those days would last for several weeks. And so she starts to try to invite him up to her place and attack and attract and attach to him.

And he says very kindly and very nicely and very courteously. Thank you very much. Thank you.

That's great. Thank you. Glad to see you.

But no, no, thank you. And it starts to walk away. And suddenly it occurs to her.

Maybe he didn't really recognize me. And she turned to him and said, Augustin, it is I. Augustin turned around and smiled and said, yes, I know.

But it is not I. See, she said, it's me, Augustin. And he said, yeah, I know.

But it's not me. What's that mean? Here's what he was saying.

I used to be a person that had to have female affection. That's the reason I was in relationships, whether no matter how destructive they were to you or to me, they were never about love. They were about me and about using you to get to to fill the black hole which never was filled.

I used to be a kind of person that had to have. I was driven, say, it was a spiritual master. But I have a new master.

And when I think of what, to the degree I think of who I am in him and what he thinks of me, I don't need this. I am free to love. I don't need anymore the same things I used to need.

That's what he's saying. And you know, you can fill in the blank. This is how you change.

You can say I used to be the kind of person that crumbled under criticism because I had to have always perfect approval. I used to be a kind of person that couldn't break up. But now I'm free to do what's really best for me and that other person.

I'm someone else in Jesus. That's how it works. Okay.

So okay, second question. Why is it to take so long then? Because let's be honest about the fact that there's an awful lot of people who have received Jesus and they've brought them, you know, and they got this new identity.

They understand this. And yet the years go by and the years go by and they're not changing. Or should I say, we're not changing.

You're not changing. Why does it take so long? Dr.

David Martin Lloyd-Jones who in his 50s and 60s preached in London preached all long series on Romans chapter 6. And that the heart of his series to understand what Romans 6 is talking about, he used an illustration. It's a fascinating illustration.

He says, imagine a country in which one group of people has for centuries enslaved to another group of people. And that's not very hard for Americans to imagine that. Even though the illustration doesn't completely fit.

Listen. So imagine a place where one group has enslaved for centuries another group. And therefore, whenever a member of the enslaved group would in the street meet a member of the oppressing group, the member of the oppressing group could order that other person around to do anything.

And if the person didn't obey, the member of the oppressing group could have in beaten or killed. Had the right, had the power, could do it. But then, a good king comes into power.

And he decrees emancipation for all the slaves. And he sets up his soldiers and he sets up his police in every town and puts his judges in his place. And they're free.

But the illustration goes on, do you think that's all it takes? It says the reality is that whenever a member of the enslaved group haven't been enslaved all their lives haven't been enslaved for centuries. Whenever a member of the enslaved group would meet a member of the oppressing group, they would tremble and quake.

And when the members of the impressing group would still order around the members of the enslaved group and tell them what to do and say, go here and go there. They did it. They did it.

抛弃你的低目标，也抛弃你的所有目标。抛弃你的低目标。人们常说：“如果我成为基督徒，我要停止做某事，那我还能继续做那些事吗？”你应该预料到会有巨大的变化，当它们开始到来时，你会非常感激这些变化。

但这些变化远远超出了你所能想象或请求的范围。而且，在刚开始的时候，你的思想还不够开放、活跃和灵性敏锐，以至于无法知道你需要什么。所以首先，你要认识到自己精神上的奴役状态。其次，你必须开始理解与他的宇宙统一的广度和深度。

最后，你也必须做到这一点——这里有一个秘密：你必须每天从新的身份中生活。你必须每天从新的身份中生活。两节经文告诉你这一点，在这里，第六节说：“我们知道我们的旧人已经与他同钉十字架，使罪的身体灭绝了，叫我们不再作罪的奴仆。”你的旧我——你以前的身份——已经被钉死在十字架上。

这是一个过去式。它已经完成了。你的旧我、你以前的身份已经消失了。当你成为基督徒，你不再是原来的人。

所以你的旧身份已经不存在了，你有了新的身份。从这个新的身份出发，保罗说要除去身体中的罪。这并不是指你的肉体有罪，而是指在灵性导师的统治下，你的身体和行为有罪。你看完整句话了吗？

它是指你的生活、你的决定，也就是保罗用来描述你在世界上的生活方式的方式。通过你新的身份，你可以打破旧的精神导师对你的影响。这就是第六节的意思。但第十一节说，这个身份是秘密。

看看第十一节。这并不是自动发生的。同样，你们要认为自己已经死于罪。你们已经死于罪了。

你们现在与神同活，但你们必须把自己视为已死于罪、活于神的人。你们必须提醒自己是谁。第十二节说，因此，不要让罪在你们的肉身中掌权，使你们顺服罪。这指的是邪恶的欲望。

**这意味着，一方面，如果你没有按照需要改变，作为基督徒你并不缺乏资源。**你都有了，你需要的一切都有了。另一方面，这些资源需要被运用，并不是自动发生的。如果你有时未能按应有的方式生活，未能改变，那是因为你忘记了你是谁。

你意识不到你是谁。你忘了你在耶稣里的身份。这就是重点。这是关键。

让我用三个问题来结束今天的讲道，当然我会在接下来的几周里解开这些问题的答案。因为当你听到这些时，你会问这三个问题：这怎么可能？为什么需要这么长时间？为什么这么难？

这怎么可能呢？现在，你们中有些人可能知道我最喜欢的例子之一是奥古斯丁。圣奥古斯丁，在他成为基督徒之前，有一个性自控的问题。但有一天，他在街上走着，他的一个旧情人出现了，还追了上来。

她是他特别感兴趣的人之一。而且，她想把他拉到一起，那种关系在当时通常会持续几周。于是她开始试着邀请他去她的住处，并试图吸引和接近他。而他说得非常客气、非常友善、也非常有礼貌：“谢谢您。

谢谢。” “那真是太好了，很高兴见到你。”但他回答说，“不，不用了，谢谢。”然后他就走了。

突然间，她意识到了一个问题。也许他没有认出我来。于是她转向他，说道：“奥古斯丁，是我啊。”奥古斯丁转过身来笑了笑，说：“是的，我知道。

” 但她又说：“不，我是你认识的那个我。”奥古斯丁回答道：“嗯，我知道。” 但这不是我。这是什么意思？

他说的是： “过去我是一个必须依赖女性关爱的人。这就是为什么我会进入那些关系的原因，无论这些关系对你还是对我有多大的破坏性，它们都不是出于爱。它们都是关于我自己，是利用你来填补那个永远无法被填满的黑洞。” “过去我是那种必须依赖别人的人。

我曾被驱使，可以说是一个精神导师。但现在我有了新的主人。当我想到自己在他心中的位置以及他如何看待我的时候，我不再需要这些了。我已经自由地爱上了他人。

我不再需要那些曾经让我依赖的东西了。” 这就是他说的话。你知道的，你可以填上空白。这正是你如何改变的方式。

你可以这样说：“过去我是那种在批评面前崩溃的人，因为我总是需要完美的认可。”或者“过去我是一个无法分手的人，但现在我可以自由地去做对自己和对方最好的事情。” 我在耶稣里成了另一个人。就是这样运作的。

好的。所以第二个问题来了：为什么这个过程会这么漫长呢？因为让我们诚实面对一个事实吧——有很多人接受了耶稣，并且他们得到了新的身份认同，理解了这一点。然而，年复一年过去，他们并没有改变。

或者说，我们没有改变。为什么会这样？大卫·马丁·罗杰斯在50多岁和60多岁时，在伦敦布道时，曾对罗马书第六章进行了长篇系列讲解。他在这系列讲道的核心是帮助人们理解罗马书第六章的内容，并用了一个生动的比喻来说明这一点。

他说：“想象一个国家，其中一部分人几百年来一直奴役另一部分人。这很容易让美国人联想到现实。”尽管这个比喻并不完全贴切。听好了。

所以想象一下，在一个地方，有一部分人几百年来一直在奴役另一部分人。因此，每当被奴役群体中的一员在街上遇到压迫者群体中的一员时，后者可以命令前者做任何事情。如果对方不顺从，前者就有被打或被杀的权利和权力，可以这么做。但然后，一位仁慈的国王登上了王位。

他颁布了解放所有奴隶的法令，并在他的每一个城镇部署了他的士兵和警察，在他的法庭上安插了自己的法官。他们获得了自由。但这个比喻继续说道：你认为这就足够了吗？实际上，当被奴役群体中的一员几百年来一直生活在奴役之中时，每当他们遇到压迫者群体中的成员，他们仍然会颤抖、战栗。

## 真正的释放 / True Liberation

Now, the member of the oppressing group didn't have the power really to do that anymore. And if they'd stood up, they couldn't have done a thing. And yet over and over and over again, the member of the enslaved group continued to act like slaves because though their status had changed, really changed.

The reality really changed. They were truly free. They hadn't grasped it.

They hadn't realized it. They couldn't live according to it. They remained as slaves.

And Lloyd Jones said, he ends his illustration by saying every Christian in this room is in that condition. It's the only reason you do anything wrong is the only reason you cannot change is the only reason you are still all wrapped up and absorbed in, you know, epi fears and epi anger and epi discouragement all the time. And while you can't break your habits, you don't know who you are.

You've got a real status change. It's really there. It's not just in your mind.

It's not just symbolic. It really happened. And yet you don't know who you are.

That's why it takes so long. It took long for that group. It's going to take long for us.

You say, well, I know. But you know what? I've even heard that illustration because I've been here for 15 years.

And I've heard you even say that. And I'm still not sure that I'm still not changing like I should. One more question.

One more answer. In verse 17, it says, you were slaves as soon. But thanks be to God, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were interested.

Now, the form of teaching is the first part of Romans. It's the gospel. And it says, you used to be slaves of sin, but the gospel set your heart on fire.

And in the end, going through a little set of steps with a counselor or with a pastor is still not really the secret. And here's why. Years ago, in the beginning of time, according to the Bible, the serpent said to Adam and Eve, if you utterly offer yourself to God, if you do whatever he says unconditionally, if you obey him completely, he will abuse you.

And you see, all of us sons of Adam and daughters of Eve have had that lie come down into our hearts. It's still there. We believe, see, it says, offer yourself to God.

And there's a part of our heart that say he will abuse us like all the other masters. See, when we're living for career, or we're living for love, or we're living for these things, we don't feel like we're enslaved. But when the idea of giving ourselves to God, offering ourselves to God, unconditionally, we have to do whatever he says, anything in the Bible we have to say it, we have no more freedom.

That feels terrible. And so we say, I can't do it. I can't do it.

We're afraid to do it. And so we live in our kind of illusion of independence. We're actually in slaves instead of going into what looks to us like slavery, which is actually the freedom of service to God.

How are we going to break that? And the answer is, the gospel, what Jesus did, has to inflame the heart. I recently read an essay about a movie, which I haven't seen, but I'd like to rent now that I read the essay.

It was a movie about Vietnam right after the Vietnamese war, you know, like in the 70s. And it's a movie called Three Seasons. And it's got four vignettes in it.

And one of them is about a cyclodriver named Hai, H-A-I. And the cyclodriver is a bicycle rickshaw. And he's poor, impoverished.

And he loves Lawn, L-A-N, a prostitute, a beautiful prostitute. Now both Hai and Lawn have completely unfulfilled desires because Hai can't afford Lawn. And Lawn, as a prostitute, is trying to sleep her way out of the life she hates.

She hates the life of poverty. She hates the dirty life she's in. And she longs to be able to go to the clean, beautiful life of the people who live in those elegant hotels where she has to come and do tricks for her customers, but she has to leave because she's never allowed to stay overnight.

And she dreams of someday leaving the world of poverty and getting into that world, the world of the hotel, the world of the people who are able to live there. But it's not working because the more she gives herself to prostitution in order to get out of her poverty, the more she's being brutalized, the more she's being enslaved. But then Hai enters a cyclod race and to his surprise wins the grand prize.

And now he's got a bunch of money. And because he's got a bunch of money, maybe his life can change, but guess what he does? He blows it all on one thing.

He rents a room in this elegant hotel overnight and he pays lawns fee. And so I want to see you in that room tonight. All the money.

Okay, well, he's going to get his harsh desire, right? And so everybody, all the viewers are expecting this steamy cinematic love scene. Of course, it's after all.

It's a Sundance Film Festival movie. There's going to be a lot of sex in it. So we're all expecting it and lawns expecting it too.

But then to everybody's shock, they get there and he says, I don't want to have sex with you. And here's how the essay goes. This is what he actually says.

He has only purchased her a place as an actual guest in the normal world she dreams of joining. And he asks only permission to watch her fall asleep in it. Slowly, comfortably, she falls asleep and he's gone by the morning.

Having demanded nothing from her except the chance to fulfill her desire to belong. But something snaps in her. She finds she can't go back to her whole job of prostitution.

Having experienced for the first time someone who used his power to serve her rather than use her, she gets a new sense of her own dignity. She's not the same person. She's changed by the transforming grace of selfless love.

Now, Jesus Christ had all the power in the world. And he looks down at us and he sees us trapped in the things that we think are going to free us, but they're enslaving us. And what does he do?

Philippians 2 says he emptied himself and became a servant. Mark chapter 1045 says, I came not to be served. He says, but to serve and give my life a ransom for many.

John chapter 13 says he took off his outer garment and he girded himself as a servant in order to wash her feet. And what does this mean? He laid aside the infinities and the immensities of his being and he purchased not just at the cost of money, but at the cost of his life.

A room in the only place there are hearts can rest his father's house. He denied himself to love us and if Lawn was transformed by the knowledge of his selfless love, how much more will we be able to say like a gustan to all the spiritual masters and all the spiritual mistresses out there? It's not me.

Now, why wouldn't you want to offer yourself to the only master in the universe who's offered himself for you? He's offered himself absolutely utterly. Trust him then.

Your career, give yourself to your career, careers never going to die for you. Your career is never going to offer itself for you. If you don't fulfill its dictates, it will punish you all of your life.

Give yourself to him. Give yourself to the one master who became a servant and you'll know what Thomas Kramer in the old prayer book said that his service alone is perfect freedom. Let's pray.

We thank you father for this overview of how we can change and what true freedom is and we ask that you would help us to apply it to our hearts with your Holy Spirit and we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel and Life podcast.

而当压迫者群体的成员依然命令被奴役群体的人做这做那时，后者还是会照做。他们会去这里，去做那里。实际上，压迫者群体的成员已经没有真正的权力这样做。如果他们站出来，也无计可施。

然而，一遍又一遍地，被奴役群体中的一员仍然像奴隶一样行事，因为尽管他们的地位真的发生了变化，但他们并没有真正理解这一点。他们没有抓住这个事实，也没有意识到这一点，无法按照自由的生活方式来生活。他们依然像奴隶一样活着。And罗德·琼斯说，他用这个比喻结束时说道：在座的每一位基督徒都处于这种状态。

你们做错事、无法改变、仍然深陷恐惧、愤怒和沮丧中的唯一原因就是你们无法打破习惯。你不知道自己是谁。这确实是一个实质性的转变。它真实存在，并不只是存在于你的意识中。

它不仅仅是一种象征，而是真的发生了，但你却不知道自己是谁。这就是为什么需要时间的原因。那群人用了很长时间，我们也会用很长的时间。你说：“我知道。

”但是你知道吗？我已经听过这个比喻15年了。甚至你也说过这句话，但我仍然不确定我是否已经像应该的那样改变了。还有一个问题。

再回答一个问题。在罗马书第6章第17节中说：你们从前是奴仆，现今蒙了释放；因为你们的心被奴役的道理使你们终身为奴，如今蒙了释放，作了神的儿女。这里的“道理”指的是罗马书的第一部分，也就是福音。它说，你们过去是罪的奴仆，但福音却点燃了你们心中的火焰。

通过咨询师或牧师的一系列步骤，并不能真正解决问题。原因如下：根据圣经，在时间的开端，蛇对亚当和夏娃说：“如果你完全献身于神，无条件地听从他的吩咐，全心全意地顺服他，他会虐待你。” 我们所有人作为亚当的儿子、夏娃的女儿，都继承了这个谎言。它仍然存在于我们的内心深处。

当我们看到“奉献自己给神”这句话时，心中的一部分却在说：“他会像其他主人一样虐待我们。” 当我们在为事业、爱情或其他事物而活的时候，并不觉得自己是奴隶。但一旦想到无条件地献身于神，无论他要求什么都要去做，包括圣经中的任何事情，我们就不再有自由。这种感觉非常糟糕，所以我们说：“我做不到。

我做不到。” ——罗德·琼斯 我们害怕去做，所以生活在一种自以为是的独立之中。实际上，我们是奴隶，而不是选择看似像是奴役的东西——那是为神服务的自由。我们怎样才能打破这种局面呢？

答案是：福音，耶稣所做的事情，必须点燃我们的心。最近我读了一篇关于一部电影的文章，虽然我没有看过这部电影，但读了这篇文章后，我现在想租来看一下。这部电影是在越南战争后的70年代拍摄的，讲述的是越南的故事。电影名叫《三个季节》。

里面有四个小片段。其中一个片段是关于一个叫海（H-A-I）的人力车夫。人力车是一种用自行车拉人的交通工具。海很穷困潦倒。

他爱着一名妓女莲（L-A-N），她美丽动人。现在，海和莲都有未被满足的愿望：因为海负担不起莲；而莲作为一名妓女，正试图通过卖淫来摆脱自己厌恶的生活——贫困、肮脏的生活。她渴望过上干净、美丽的生活，那种住在那些豪华酒店里的人们所享受的生活，但她只能在晚上为顾客服务后离开，因为她从不允许在那里过夜。她梦想有一天能够逃离贫穷的世界，进入那个世界，但她的努力却适得其反：她越是通过卖淫来摆脱贫困，就越被残酷对待，越被奴役。

然而，海参加了一次人力车比赛，并意外地赢得了大奖。现在他有了很多钱。也许他的生活会因此改变，但他做了什么？他把所有的钱都花在了一个地方——他在这家豪华酒店租了一个房间过夜，并支付了莲的费用。

所以今晚我希望你们都能想象自己就在那个房间里。所有那些钱。好吧，大家都以为他会得到他渴望的东西吧？所以，所有的观众都在期待这场充满激情的电影情爱场景。

当然，这是理所应当的。这是一部圣丹斯电影节的电影。里面有很多性爱场面，所以我们都在期待，草坪也在期待。但出乎所有人意料的是，他竟然说：“我不想和你发生关系。

”接下来是文章的内容。这是他实际说的话： 他只给她买了一个地方，让她成为她梦想中正常世界的一名正式客人。然后他请求允许他看着她在那个地方入睡。慢慢地、舒适地，她睡着了，而他在第二天早上已经不在那里。

除了给她机会实现她想要归属的愿望外，他没有要求任何东西。然而，她的内心发生了变化。她发现无法回到妓女的生活中去了。因为她第一次体验到有人用他的权力来为她服务而不是利用她，她得到了一种新的尊严感。

她不再是以前的人了，是无私之爱的转变让她有了改变。耶稣基督拥有全世界的力量。他俯视着我们，看到我们在追求那些我们认为能让我们自由的东西，但实际上却在束缚我们。他做了什么？

《腓立比书》2章说他空了自己，成为仆人。《马可福音》10章45节说：“我来不是要受人的服事。”他说：“而是要服事，并且舍弃自己的生命为许多人作赎价。” 《约翰福音》13章说他脱下外衣，像仆人一样给自己包上，洗了门徒的脚。

这又意味着什么呢？他放弃了自己无限和无尽的存在，不仅用金钱购买，还用他的生命来换取。一个房间，那是唯一有心的地方——父神的家。他拒绝了自己的权利去爱我们。

如果草坪通过了解他的无私之爱而被改变，那么我们能像奥古斯丁一样对所有的精神导师说：“不是我。” 现在，你为什么不想把自己献给宇宙中唯一为你自己付出一切的主人呢？他已经完全、彻底地为我们付出了。相信他吧。

您的职业，请全心投入您的职业，因为职业不会为您而死。职业也不会主动为您服务。如果您不遵从它的要求，它会终生惩罚您。请将自己交给他。

请将自己交给那位成为仆人的主人，您就会明白托马斯·克雷默在旧祈祷书中所说的话：唯有他的服事才是**真正的自由。让我们祷告。我们感谢您，父亲，赐给我们如何改变和什么是**真正自由的概览，并求您借着您的圣灵帮助我们将这些应用到我们的心中。我们在耶稣基督的名下祈求。
