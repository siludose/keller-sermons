## 福音在生命中的介绍 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel and Life. When someone you know is contemplating life's deepest questions, who am I? What's wrong with the world?

What can truly make me whole? Jesus doesn't just give us answers. He gives us Himself.

In this month's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how we can share the hope we have in Christ as the answer to a person's search for meaning and purpose. As you may know, August is going to share month that Gospel and life, and we've curated a wide range of free resources to help you take simple steps to share the Gospel with someone God has put in your life. You can access these resources at gospelonlife.com slash share.

We believe God uses small acts to do great things, and we're inviting you to do simple, small acts to go and share the Gospel this month because the Gospel changes everything. The reading this morning is from John's Gospel chapter 5 verses 31 to 47. If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.

There's another who testifies my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is true. You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth, not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it that you may be saved. John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.

I have testimony weightier than that of John, but the works that the Father has given me to finish, the very works I am doing, testify that the Father has sent me, and the Father who sent me has Himself testified concerning me. You've never heard His voice, nor seen His form, nor does His Word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one He sent. You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life.

These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life. I do not accept glory from human beings, but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.

I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me, but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept Him. How can you believe since you accept glory from one another, but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? But do not think I will accuse you before the Father.

Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?

欢迎来到《福音在生命中》。当你认识的人在思考人生最深层的问题时——我是谁？这个世界出了什么问题？

什么能真正使我完全？耶稣不仅给我们答案，祂将祂自己给了我们。

在本月的播客中，提摩太·凯勒探讨我们如何分享我们在基督里的盼望，作为一个人寻求意义和目的的答案。你可能知道，八月是《福音在生命中》的分享月，我们精心策划了广泛的免费资源，帮助你采取简单的步骤，与神放在你生命中的人分享福音。你可以在 gospelonlife.com/share 访问这些资源。

我们相信神使用小小的行动成就大事，我们邀请你做简单、微小的行动，在这个月去分享福音，因为福音改变一切。今天早上的经文选读来自约翰福音第五章31到47节。我若为自己作见证，我的见证就不真。

另有一位给我作见证，我也知道他给我作的见证是真的。你们曾差人到约翰那里，他为真理作过见证。其实我所受的见证不是从人来的，然而我说这些话，为要叫你们得救。约翰是点着的明灯，你们情愿暂时喜欢他的光。

但我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要我成就的事，就是我所做的事，这便见证我是父所差来的。差我来的父也为我作过见证。你们从来没有听见祂的声音，也没有看见祂的形象。你们并没有祂的道存在心里，因为祂所差来的，你们不信。你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。

给我作见证的就是这经。然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。我不受从人来的荣耀。

但我知道你们心里没有神的爱。我奉我父的名来，你们并不接待我；若有别人奉自己的名来，你们倒要接待他。你们互相受荣耀，却不求从独一之神来的荣耀，怎能信我呢？不要想我在父面前要告你们。

告你们的就是摩西，就是你们所仰赖的。你们如果信摩西，也必信我，因为他书上有指着我写的话。你们若不信他所写的，怎能信我所说的呢？

## 圣经在公共话语中的地位 / The Bible in Public Discourse

The past of which is the Sermonist Base, John 5, is about the Bible. We've been talking about talking about our faith in public. This is the last week in that series.

Next week we begin an event which is, by the way, an awfully interesting time and good time to invite people perhaps to come if you have been talking to somebody and they have been showing interest. But when you talk to people about faith in public, right away the Bible comes up. Very often people say, first of all, the Bible today, the Bible is a very nice book filled with good things, but in the end it's a human book.

It's a human book written by human beings. There's contradictions in it. There's things in it we can't trust anymore, so the Bible has to be filtered.

There's some things we can follow, some things we can't because it's a human book. What I'd like to show you is what Jesus Christ's own view of the Scripture is and then we'll apply that. John 5 starts with Jesus healing a man, a lame man, and then when the crowd gathers he begins to teach them about himself and he makes some amazing claims.

He claims to be the judge of the earth. He claims to be the giver of life and these claims are pretty astounding. So astounding, some of the people were very angry at him, verse 18 of chapter 5 says they recognized that he was making himself equal with God.

And so they challenge him. Why should we believe you? That is the context for this first verse which on the surface looks a little bit surprising.

Verse 31 says, if I testify about myself, my testimony is not true. Now on the surface, it looks like what he's saying is you don't have to believe what I'm saying. It's not true, but what he actually is saying is this.

In the context of Jewish jurisprudence, if a claim was made, you had to have two or three corroborating witnesses. You had two or three corroborating pieces of testimony. And so what Jesus is saying here is he saying, okay, I understand that my testimony wouldn't be valid.

If I'm the only one, my claims right here, if that's the only testimony you had. But he says, I got three more than he lists them. First, he lists John the Baptist who was a very respected prophet.

Secondly, he lists his own works. He says in verse 36, I have testimony way bigger than that of John, for the works that the father has given me to finish, the very works I am doing testify that the father has sent me. He says, look at my miracles and eventually look at my death and my resurrection, the works that I'm supposed to finish.

Don't just listen to what John said, look and don't just even listen to my words, look at my deeds, look at what I've done, look what I am doing. But then thirdly, he actually says, and the father testifies through what? Verse 39, 40, the scriptures testify of me.

That's the third witness. Now in this context, he would have been talking about the Old Testament, what we would call the Old Testament. But notice for us, where do you get the testimony of John, the Baptist today?

Where do you get a chance to look at the works of Jesus Christ, the life and ministry of Jesus Christ? It's in what we call the New Testament. In other words, every three witnesses, every one of them, Jesus gives us here is in the scripture.

这段讲道所基于的经文是约翰福音第五章，关于圣经。我们一直在谈论在公共场合谈论我们的信仰。这是这个系列的最后一周。

下周我们开始一个活动，顺便说一句，这是一个非常有趣的时间，也是邀请人们来的好时机，如果你一直在与某人交谈，而他们表现出兴趣的话。但当你在公共场合与人们谈论信仰时，圣经马上就会被提及。人们经常会说，首先，今天的圣经，圣经是一本很好的书，充满了好东西，但归根结底它是一本人写的书。

它是人类写的书。里面有矛盾。里面有我们不能再相信的东西，所以圣经必须经过筛选。

有些事情我们可以遵循，有些事情我们不能，因为它是人写的书。我想向你展示的是耶稣基督自己对圣经的看法，然后我们再应用它。约翰福音第五章开始时，耶稣医治了一个瘸腿的人，然后当人群聚集时，祂开始教导他们关于祂自己的事，祂提出了一些惊人的宣称。

祂宣称自己是地上的审判者。祂宣称自己是生命的赐予者，这些宣称相当惊人。如此惊人，以至于有些人对祂非常生气，第五章第18节说，他们认识到祂使自己与神平等。

所以他们挑战祂。我们为什么要相信你？这就是第一节经文的背景，从表面上看这节经文有点令人惊讶。

第31节说，我若为自己作见证，我的见证就不真。表面上看，好像祂在说你不必相信我所说的。这不是真的，但祂实际上在说的是这个。

在犹太法律体系的背景下，如果提出一个主张，你必须有两三个佐证见证人。你必须有两三个佐证的证词。所以耶稣在这里说的是，好的，我理解我的见证是无效的。

如果我是唯一的，我的主张就在这里，如果那是你唯一的证词。但祂说，我还有三个，然后祂列举了它们。首先，祂列举了施洗约翰，他是一位非常受尊敬的先知。

其次，祂列举了祂自己的作为。祂在第36节说，但我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要我成就的事，就是我所做的事，这便见证我是父所差来的。祂说，看看我的神迹，最终看看我的死和我的复活，就是我应该完成的工作。

不要只听约翰说了什么，要看，甚至不要只听我的话，看看我的行为，看看我做了什么，看看我正在做什么。但第三，祂实际上说，父通过什么作见证？第39、40节，圣经为我作见证。

这是第三个见证。在这个背景下，祂会谈论旧约，我们称之为旧约。但请注意，对我们来说，今天你在哪里得到施洗约翰的见证？

你在哪里有机会看到耶稣基督的作为，耶稣基督的生平和事工？它在我们所说的新约中。换句话说，每三个见证人，耶稣在这里给我们的每一个见证，都在圣经中。

## 圣经完全的神圣权威 / The Complete Divine Authority of the Bible

And in the process of looking at what he says here, we learn three things that Jesus himself believed about the scripture, which I think are very relevant to those of us who are trying to talk to people about the Bible. Jesus believes in the complete authority, unity, and vitality, power of the Bible. The authority, the unity, and the vitality.

Look at these three points with me. First of all, he believes in the absolute complete divine authority of the Bible. Now, to get that, you can go to almost any page, almost to the New Testament.

But look what he says here. He says in verse 37, the father has testified concerning me. Where?

He says, you study the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life. They are the scriptures that testify about me. Now, when Jesus here, evidently, is calling the Old Testament God's testimony, he's really just going along with everything else he has said.

Jesus' view of the Bible is extraordinarily important for Christians. Let me just lay out what his view was for a minute. It's actually too to talk about Jesus' view.

A view is an intellectual stance. But, for example, Jesus said in John chapter 10, the scripture cannot be broken, can't be disregarded. In Matthew 5, 18, he talks about not a jot or a tittle of the word of God passing away to all his fulfill.

Now, a jot and a tittle was basically the smallest Hebrew letter and a part of a Hebrew letter. It would be like us saying, I don't just believe that the general ideas of the Bible are spired, the cross on every t and the dot on every eye is inspired by God and will not pass away to all his fulfilled. Sometimes Jesus' view of the scripture goes by quickly.

In Matthew chapter 19, when Jesus is talking about marriage, he quotes Genesis 2, Old Testament Genesis 2, where it says, a man shall leave his father and cleave to his wife. Jesus in Matthew 19 says, God said that. God said, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife.

But if you go back into Genesis 2, you'll see that it's the narrator, it's the author of Genesis that says that. And that means that Jesus says, Jesus believes that whatever a biblical author says, God says, whatever, which means you can throw your letter, red letter, Bible away. See, the red letter Bible implies, well, this is Jesus' words or these are God's words, but then the rest of Paul's words and David's words and those people.

But this is Jesus' words and Jesus himself doesn't look at the Bible like that at all. But see, for even Jesus to say, every single thing that any biblical author writes is God's word, every jot, every tittle. That's still a view.

If you want to understand how Jesus really regarded the Bible in his actual life, every time Satan assaulted him in the wilderness, what's Jesus say? Go drop a tie. That word is right on your lips, wasn't it?

The Greek word, it is written. Every time Satan assaults him, what does Jesus do? Gets out the scripture.

It is written, quote, scripture. When Peter gets out of a sword, you know, to defend Jesus when he's being arrested, what does Jesus say? He says, put up your sword.

Don't you know I could call 12 legions of angels, but then how would this scripture be fulfilled? Just amazes me that here's people running around with swords and staves. There's a riot going on and Jesus is thinking of this scripture.

He's on his way to the cross. He's already been tortured and he's carrying the cross and he's literally dying. Do you remember on the way to the cross?

On the way to Calvary, he meets some women who are weeping and this is in Luke 23 and he says, daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me. Weep for yourselves for the prophet, hath said, and then he quotes Isaiah. He quotes Isaiah.

And then, of course, when he actually gets to the cross, Matthew 27, 45, we talk about it all the time, my God, my God, what has not forsaken me? It's a very, very famous spot in the Bible where Jesus is at the moment of His greatest need. He says, my God, my God, why has not forsaken me?

He was quoting the scripture. He was quoting Psalm chapter 22, verse 1. He obviously had the whole Psalm in his mind.

Somebody years ago, I can't remember who said, if you stab Jesus Christ, he bleeds the Bible. It was the very operating principle of his life. At every turn he was thinking of the scripture.

At every time there was a test, every time there was a temptation, every time there was darkness in his life, how did he handle it? He handled it through the scripture. He didn't just believe in the full, he did believe in the full divine plenary inspiration and authority of the Bible.

He believed that everything the Bible said, God said, did he believe that? Yeah. But beyond that, it was the operating principle of his life.

在查看祂在这里所说的话的过程中，我们了解到耶稣自己对圣经的三个信念，我认为这对我们这些试图与人们谈论圣经的人非常相关。耶稣相信圣经的完全权威、统一性和生命力。权威、统一性和生命力。

请与我一起看这三点。首先，祂相信圣经绝对完全的神圣权威。要理解这一点，你几乎可以翻到新约的任何一页。

但看看祂在这里说了什么。祂在第37节说，父已经为我作过见证。在哪里？

祂说，你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。给我作见证的就是这经。显然，耶稣在这里称旧约为神的见证，祂实际上只是在延续祂所说的其他一切。

耶稣对圣经的看法对基督徒来说极其重要。让我先简单阐述一下祂的看法。实际上谈论耶稣的看法是不够的。

看法是一种智识立场。但是，例如，耶稣在约翰福音第十章说，圣经不能被废弃，不能被忽视。在马太福音5章18节，祂谈到神的话一点一画都不能废去，直到都成全了。

一点一画基本上是最小的希伯来字母和希伯来字母的一部分。这就像我们说，我不只是相信圣经的一般观点是受默示的，每个t上的横和每个i上的点都是受神默示的，在成全之前都不会废去。有时耶稣对圣经的看法一闪而过。

在马太福音第十九章，当耶稣谈论婚姻时，祂引用创世记第二章，旧约创世记第二章，那里说，人要离开父母，与妻子连合。耶稣在马太福音19章说，神说的。神说，人要离开父母，与妻子连合。

但如果你回到创世记第二章，你会看到那是叙述者，是创世记的作者说的。这意味着耶稣说，耶稣相信无论圣经作者说什么，神就说什么，无论什么，这意味着你可以扔掉你的红字圣经了。看，红字圣经暗示，这是耶稣的话或这些是神的话，但其余的是保罗的话和大卫的话和那些人的话。

但这是耶稣的话，而耶稣自己根本不是这样看圣经的。但看，即使耶稣说，任何一个圣经作者写的每一件事都是神的话，每一点，每一画。这仍然是一种看法。

如果你想了解耶稣在祂的实际生活中如何真正看待圣经，每次撒但在旷野攻击祂时，耶稣说什么？经上记着说。这个词就在你嘴边，不是吗？

希腊词，经上记着说。每次撒但攻击祂，耶稣做什么？拿出圣经。

经上记着说，引用圣经。当彼得拔出剑，你知道，要保护耶稣，当祂被捕时，耶稣说什么？祂说，收刀入鞘。

你不知道我可以求父，祂立刻给我差遣十二营多的天使来吗？但这样经上的话怎么应验呢？令我惊讶的是，这里有人拿着刀棍到处跑。有暴乱在进行，而耶稣在想着这经。

祂在去十字架的路上。祂已经被折磨了，祂背着十字架，祂确实在死去。你记得在去十字架的路上吗？

在去各各他的路上，祂遇到一些哭泣的妇女，这在路加福音23章，祂说，耶路撒冷的女子，不要为我哭。当为自己哭，因为先知曾说，然后祂引用以赛亚书。祂引用以赛亚书。

然后，当然，当祂真正到达十字架时，马太福音27章45节，我们一直在谈论它，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我？这是圣经中一个非常非常著名的地方，耶稣在祂最需要的时刻。祂说，我的神,我的神，为什么离弃我？

祂在引用圣经。祂在引用诗篇第二十二篇第一节。祂显然脑海中有整篇诗篇。

多年前有人说，我记不得是谁了，如果你刺伤耶稣基督，祂流出的是圣经。这是祂生命的运作原则。祂每时每刻都在想着圣经。

每次有考验，每次有试探，每次祂的生命中有黑暗时，祂如何处理？祂通过圣经处理。祂不只是相信，祂确实相信圣经完全的神圣全备默示和权威。

祂相信圣经说的一切，神都说了，祂相信吗？是的。但除此之外，这是祂生命的运作原则。

## 你能不遵守全部圣经而成为基督徒吗？ / Can You Be a Christian Without Following All the Bible?

Now, having said that, what do you say when someone says, well, you know, you Christians, it's okay to be a Christian, but you really can't take the Bible literally. Now, and I've actually heard Christians who said, or at least professing Christians, who said, well, I'm a Christian, but I don't take every part of the Bible literally. Some parts of it we just can't follow anymore.

Now, every thoughtful Christian that hears somebody talk about the taking the Bible literally has to wince. And the reason you have to wince is because at one level, no, you don't take the Bible literally exactly. I mean, the point is if the Bible has poetry in it, where it says God was wrestling with the sea monster, and it's obviously poetry, there it's Hebrew poetry.

It's all laid out that way. You read it as the author wants you to read it. If the author is a poet and is trying to make his point through poetry, then you read it as a poet, as a poem, and you don't necessarily take it literally.

Over here, you have Luke. And Luke says, oh, theophilus, I'm going to write you an account, an orderly account, which is a historical account of based on eyewitness testimony of what happened in the life of Jesus. And when Luke says, Jesus Christ rose on the third day, it's obvious that Luke wants us to believe he's teaching us about something that literally happened.

There's a certain sense in which do you take the Bible literally? Well, it depends on what the author is trying to say. As soon as you try to, we live in a sound by culture, and as soon as you try to start to explain that everybody's eyes glaze over.

I think probably a better answer to the question, can you be a Christian and not take all the Bible literally? Usually what that means is I can be a Christian, but I don't have to follow every part of the Bible. The answer to that is no.

There's a nice soundbite for you. Two letters. No, why?

How could you possibly say you can follow Jesus and then reject one of the main operating principles of his life? One of the main things he lived and died for. That is the height of disingenuousness.

Without a belief in the full authority of the Bible, you aren't following Jesus. You're following somebody that you're calling Jesus. And it's more than that.

Every indication is that if you say, well, I believe in God and I want to have a spiritual experience, but I don't want to have a fully authoritative Bible because there's some parts of it that we just can't follow anymore. Just some parts I don't like. Some parts I don't want to accept.

---

现在，说了这些，当有人说，你知道，你们基督徒，做基督徒可以，但你真的不能按字面意思理解圣经。现在，我实际上听到基督徒说过，或者至少自称的基督徒说过，我是基督徒，但我不按字面意思理解圣经的每一部分。其中一些部分我们就是不能再遵守了。

现在，每一个有思想的基督徒听到有人谈论按字面意思理解圣经时都必须畏缩。你必须畏缩的原因是，在某种程度上，不，你确实不完全按字面意思理解圣经。我的意思是，关键是如果圣经中有诗歌，那里说神与海怪搏斗，这显然是诗歌，这是希伯来诗歌。

都是那样编排的。你按照作者想让你阅读的方式阅读。如果作者是诗人，试图通过诗歌表达他的观点，那么你就把它作为诗，作为一首诗来读，你不一定按字面意思理解。

这里，你有路加。路加说，哦，提阿非罗，我要给你写一个有次序的叙述，这是一个历史叙述，基于对耶稣生平所发生事情的目击证词。当路加说，耶稣基督第三天复活了，很明显路加想让我们相信祂在教导我们一件确实发生的事。

在某种意义上，你按字面意思理解圣经吗？嗯，这取决于作者试图说什么。我们生活在一个追求简短表述的文化中，一旦你试图开始解释这一点，每个人的眼睛都会呆滞。

我想可能对这个问题更好的回答是，你能成为基督徒而不按字面意思理解全部圣经吗？通常这意味着我可以成为基督徒，但我不必遵守圣经的每一部分。答案是不能。

这里有一个很好的简短答案给你。两个字。不能，为什么？

你怎么可能说你跟随耶稣，然后拒绝祂生命的主要运作原则之一？祂为之而生而死的主要事情之一。这是极端的不真诚。

没有对圣经完全权威的信仰，你就不是在跟随耶稣。你在跟随你称之为耶稣的某个人。而且不止于此。

每一个迹象都表明，如果你说，我相信神，我想要有属灵的经历，但我不想要一本完全权威的圣经，因为其中有些部分我们就是不能再遵守了。只是有些部分我不喜欢。有些部分我不想接受。

## 机器人星球：为什么我们需要一位会回应的神 / The Android Planet: Why We Need a God Who Talks Back

In the second season of the old TV Star Trek series, second season. This is way back, 70s, 67s at 1969. There was a very funny, it was a comedic, an episode called I Mud.

It was about Harry Mud, who was a space scoundrel, who decided to go to a planet and create a paradise for himself by creating a whole planet filled with androids. So he built all these androids. Now the majority of the androids look like beautiful women.

But he made one android to look just like his wife that he had left, of course. And his wife was a scold. So every other android on the planet, no matter what he said to them, always said, yes, Lord Mud, Harry Mud, M-U-D-D.

That was the name. The name of the episode was I Mud. And everybody on the whole planet never contracted him.

He always said, yes, Lord Mud, yes, Lord Mud, yes, Lord Mud. Except his wife robot, he would turn her on, and she would start to scold him. And she would say, hardcore, fenton mud, is that alcohol I smell on your breath?

Where have you been? And then what he would do is he would just push the off button. Where have you, you, you, you?

But he captures Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise, and he beams them down. And you know what the plot is? I mean, it was a, it was comedy, it was terrible production values, but it was, it was a brilliant idea of the plot.

He captured them because he was miserable. Why? He thought he had made himself a paradise in which nobody could contradict him.

Nobody could talk back to him. Nobody could say anything that he didn't like. And he realized he had no personal relationships at all, and he was dying.

We always say the gospel changes everything, and we believe it really does. That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share Month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life.

For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies of Making Sense of God by Tim Keller. It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift, and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker, or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith.

It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation or continue it. To request your two copies of Making Sense of God, simply go to gospelandlife.com slash give. Again, that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. He was dying.

He was miserable because if you actually have nobody, you have nobody to argue with you to push back to make you do things you don't want to do, to tell you things you don't want to hear. You don't have a personal relationship. They're just all Android.

So he had to capture some people so he could actually wouldn't go crazy. If you have a Bible, they can only say back to you, yes, Lord mud, because you've taken it all out. When it starts, when God says, where were you?

When I laid the foundation of the world, where were you, you, you, you? Because you've taken it all out. Anything in there that you think is regressive.

Anything that you think, you know, we can't believe anymore. History has moved on. And this is on the wrong side of history.

Okay, it's a free country. You can do it, but you don't have a God who's a personal God now. You don't have the real Jesus and you don't have a personal God who can talk back to you, who can tell you things you don't want to hear, who can actually, you know, wrestle with you.

The power of the scripture is not abstract. It's in Hebrews chapter 12, verse 5, it's an interesting spot where the Hebrew's writer is quoting, by the way, an Old Testament text, and he says, have you forgotten the exhortation that argues with you as his children, then he quotes scripture? That's literally usually the translation goes.

Have you forgotten the excerpt? Have you forgotten the scripture that exhorts you? But it's a word that means argues with you.

And I remember how helpful it was to me when I realized that one of the ways the scripture helps me, was it argues with me? You know that place where it says, if God condemns you, pardon me, if your heart's condemned you, God is greater than your heart. Your heart says, your, your nothing.

God comes in from the scripture and says, no, I love you. See, we want God to contradict us there. But if you don't want God to contradict you over here, where it tells you something you don't want to believe, how are you going to let God contradict you over here?

When he tells you, I love you in spite of what your heart says. If you want a real God, if you want a real Jesus, you've got to have an authoritative scripture. You have to have an authoritative scripture.

在老版《星际迷航》系列的第二季，第二季。这是很久以前，70年代，67到1969年。有一集非常有趣，是喜剧，一集叫《我，马德》。

那是关于哈里·马德的，他是一个太空流氓，决定去一个星球，通过创造一个充满机器人的星球为自己创造天堂。所以他制造了所有这些机器人。大多数机器人看起来像美丽的女人。

但他制造了一个机器人，让它看起来就像他离开的妻子。他的妻子是个爱唠叨的人。所以星球上的每一个其他机器人，无论他对他们说什么，总是说，是的，马德大人，哈里·马德，M-U-D-D。

那是名字。那集的名字叫《我，马德》。整个星球上的每个人都从不反驳他。

他总是说，是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人，是的，马德大人。除了他的妻子机器人，他会打开她，她会开始责骂他。她会说，硬核，芬顿·马德，我闻到你呼吸里的酒精味了吗？

你去哪儿了？然后他要做的就是按下关闭按钮。你去哪儿，你，你，你？

但他抓住了柯克船长和企业号星舰，他把他们传送下来。你知道情节是什么吗？我的意思是，这是喜剧，制作价值很糟糕，但这个情节的想法很出色。

他抓住他们是因为他很痛苦。为什么？他以为他为自己创造了一个天堂，在那里没有人可以反驳他。

没有人可以回嘴。没有人可以说任何他不喜欢的话。他意识到他根本没有任何人际关系，他快要死了。

我们总是说福音改变一切，我们真的相信它确实如此。这就是为什么在《福音在生命中》，八月是前去分享月。整个八月，我们邀请成千上万的听众迈出小小的一步，与神放在你生命中的人分享福音。

对于那些在本月向《福音在生命中》捐赠的人，我们会送你两本提摩太·凯勒的《理解神》。这是一个强大的资源，探讨基督教如何在今天的世界中在情感、文化和理性上都说得通。这是我们对你捐赠的感谢，并提供了一种方式，你可以通过与朋友一起阅读这本书，送给同事，或将两本都传递给正在探索基督教信仰的人，来做一个小小的行动来分享福音。

这是开始福音对话或继续对话的简单方式。要索取你的两本《理解神》，只需访问 gospelandlife.com/give。再次，那是 gospelandlife.com/give。

现在，这里是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。他快要死了。

他很痛苦，因为如果你实际上没有人，你没有人与你争论，反驳你，让你做你不想做的事，告诉你你不想听的事。你没有人际关系。他们都只是机器人。

所以他不得不抓住一些人，这样他才不会发疯。如果你有一本圣经，它只能对你说，是的，马德大人，因为你已经把它全部拿掉了。当神说，当我立大地根基的时候，你在哪里？你在哪里，你，你，你？因为你已经把它全部拿掉了。其中任何你认为是倒退的东西。

任何你认为，你知道，我们不能再相信的东西。历史已经前进了。这在历史的错误一边。

好的，这是一个自由的国家。你可以这样做，但你现在没有一位有位格的神。你没有真正的耶稣，你没有一位能回应你、能告诉你你不想听的事、能实际上，你知道，与你摔跤的有位格的神。

圣经的能力不是抽象的。在希伯来书第十二章第五节，这是一个有趣的地方，希伯来书的作者在引用，顺便说一句，旧约经文，他说，你们又忘了那劝你们如同劝儿子的话，然后他引用圣经？通常的翻译是这样的。

你们忘了那劝戒吗？你们忘了那圣经的劝戒吗？但这是一个意思是与你争论的词。

我记得当我意识到圣经帮助我的方式之一是它与我争论时，这对我有多大帮助。你知道那个地方说，如果神定你的罪，原谅我，如果你的心定你的罪，神比你的心大。你的心说，你什么都不是。

神从圣经中进来说，不，我爱你。看，我们想要神在那里反驳我们。但如果你不想让神在这里反驳你，当它告诉你一些你不想相信的事情时，你怎么能让神在这里反驳你呢？

当祂告诉你，尽管你的心这样说，我爱你。如果你想要一位真实的神，如果你想要真正的耶稣，你必须有一本权威的圣经。你必须有一本权威的圣经。

## 圣经的统一性：摩西指着我写 / The Unity of Scripture: Moses Wrote of Me

Second and third, more briefly actually. Jesus also is teaching here the unity of the scripture. Many people say, well the Bible's a human book and you can see, look at all the contradictions.

You Christians, you pick and choose. What about all these rules down here? Where it says you shouldn't be wearing linen and wool together or you shouldn't be eating this or you should be offering these sacrifices.

You pick and choose to. Nobody follows everything in the Bible. It's filled with contradictions.

Jesus says, Moses wrote of me. See that? It's a remarkable statement.

Verse 46, if you believe Moses, you would believe me for he wrote about me. All the stuff in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy attributed to Moses. Surely that's what Jesus is thinking about.

Moses wrote of me. He's looking at those passages. Today we tend to say, oh boy, that's kind of strange, all that stuff about diet and what you can eat and all that sort of thing.

He's looking at all that and he says, do you want to realize that all those books are about me? Now unless you understand what he's saying here, the Bible will be a kind of thicket, a tangled thicket of what looks like contradictions. But if you take what he says, it really makes sense why.

You say, well where did Moses write of me? Scholars have often said, this doesn't make sense because if you start to look through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy for some specific place where it talks about Jesus, no. But what if you take what Jesus obviously meant because we know this from what he says to them after his resurrection?

What if he says, you need to read all of Moses is about me. John chapter 1, John the Baptist sees Jesus and gets it and he says, behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. What's the Lamb?

The Lamb was slain at Passover when God was bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt and so they slew the Lamb and they put the Lamb's blood on the doorpost and the angel of death passed over and then every year the Passover, they slew it, slay a Lamb and it represents the fact that somehow God is not making his people pay for their sins. It's somehow there's some atonement being made and suddenly John the Baptist gets it, hey, Moses's Passover is really about Jesus. He's the Lamb.

He's the one who's going to take away the sins of the world. You get near the end of John chapter 1 and Jesus looks at Nathaniel and says, you're going to see angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man. What?

In the first book of Moses, Genesis, there's a passage where Jacob has a dream and he sees a stairway and on it angels are ascending and descending and he realizes that somehow this is a prediction that God is going to open a passageway between heaven and earth because the angels represent the presence of God and there'll be a way for us to get the presence of God in our lives. There'll be a way for us to somehow reunite with God that we are right now estranged from. That great, you might say, concrete slab between heaven and earth is going to be broken through.

There's going to be a stairway. There's going to be a way for us to relate to God and Jesus has the audacity to say to Nathaniel, that stairway was actually about me. I'm the Axis Mundi.

I'm the one who's going to unite heaven and earth. It's because of me and because of what I'm going to do. Oh, then you move into chapter 2, the wedding feast.

Remember? And they run out of wine. And Jesus says, look at those jars over there which were jars that had water in them for ceremonial washing.

Why? Because the mosaic law said you have to be clean to come into the presence of God. And Jesus fills those ceremonial jars with his wine indication is he's what is he saying.

I'm the one my blood is going to purify you. Moses wrote of me, all the ceremonial stuff was about me in Moses. That stairway was about me.

The Passover lamb was about me. Then you get to the end of chapter 2 and Jesus is cleansing the temple, throwing people out of the temple, and then what happens? They say, what right have you got to do this?

And he says, tear this temple down in three days and I'll build it back up. But he was talking about his resurrection. He was talking about himself.

And you know what he's saying? I'm the temple. I'm the place where God and humanity are going to meet again over the toning sacrifice.

And then I mean, I could keep this up. John chapter 3, Jesus is trying to talk to Nicodemus and he says, as Moses raised up the bronze serpent in the wilderness so that people who looked at it were saved. So I will be lifted up.

You don't have to go looking through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy to try to find some kind of messianic prophecy. Jesus says, it's all about me. It's all about me.

The Bible will be a thicket. It'll look like contradiction. But if you understand it's all pointing to me, then suddenly it becomes this incredible unity.

第二和第三，实际上更简短。耶稣也在这里教导圣经的统一性。许多人说，圣经是人写的书，你可以看到，看看所有这些矛盾。

你们基督徒，你们挑挑拣拣。那所有这些规则怎么办？那里说你不应该穿亚麻和羊毛混纺的衣服，或者你不应该吃这个，或者你应该献这些祭。

你们也挑挑拣拣。没有人遵守圣经中的所有内容。它充满了矛盾。

耶稣说，摩西指着我写。看到了吗？这是一个非凡的陈述。

第46节，你们如果信摩西，也必信我，因为他书上有指着我写的话。创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记和申命记中所有归于摩西的内容。肯定这是耶稣在想的。

摩西指着我写。祂在看那些经文。今天我们倾向于说，天哪，那有点奇怪，所有关于饮食和你能吃什么之类的东西。

祂在看所有这些，祂说，你想知道所有这些书都是关于我的吗？除非你理解祂在这里说的话，否则圣经将是一种灌木丛，一种看起来像矛盾的纠缠的灌木丛。但如果你接受祂所说的，就真的说得通了，为什么。

你说，摩西在哪里指着我写？学者们经常说，这说不通，因为如果你开始在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记中寻找某个谈论耶稣的具体地方，没有。但如果你接受耶稣显然的意思，因为我们从祂复活后对他们说的话中知道这一点？

如果祂说，你需要读所有摩西的书都是关于我的。约翰福音第一章，施洗约翰看到耶稣并明白了，他说，看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的。羔羊是什么？

羔羊在逾越节被杀，当神将以色列人从埃及带出来时，他们杀了羔羊，把羔羊的血涂在门框上，死亡的天使越过，然后每年逾越节，他们杀羔羊，它代表着神不让祂的子民为他们的罪付出代价的事实。不知何故有赎罪正在进行，突然施洗约翰明白了，嘿，摩西的逾越节真的是关于耶稣的。祂是羔羊。

祂是那位要除去世人罪孽的。你接近约翰福音第一章的结尾，耶稣看着拿但业说，你将看到天使在人子身上上去下来。什么？

在摩西的第一卷书创世记中，有一段雅各做梦的经文，他看到一个梯子，天使在上面上去下来，他意识到不知何故这是一个预言，神将打开天地之间的通道，因为天使代表神的同在，将有一条路让我们在生活中得到神的同在。将有一条路让我们以某种方式与我们现在疏远的神重新联合。天地之间那块巨大的，你可以说，混凝土板将被打破。

将有一个梯子。将有一条路让我们与神建立关系，耶稣大胆地对拿但业说，那个梯子实际上是关于我的。我是世界之轴。

我是那位要联合天地的。这是因为我和我将要做的事。哦，然后你进入第二章，婚宴。

记得吗？他们的酒用完了。耶稣说，看看那边那些罐子，那是装水用于仪式洗濯的罐子。

为什么？因为摩西律法说你必须洁净才能进入神的同在。耶稣用祂的酒装满那些仪式用的罐子，暗示是，祂在说什么？

我是那一位，我的血将要洁净你。摩西指着我写，摩西中所有仪式性的东西都是关于我的。那个梯子是关于我的。

逾越节的羔羊是关于我的。然后你到第二章的结尾，耶稣洁净圣殿，把人赶出圣殿，然后发生了什么？他们说，你凭什么做这事？

祂说，你们拆毁这殿，我三日内要再建立起来。但祂是在谈论祂的复活。祂在谈论祂自己。

你知道祂在说什么吗？我就是圣殿。我是神和人类将要再次相遇的地方，通过赎罪的祭。

然后我的意思是，我可以继续下去。约翰福音第三章，耶稣试图与尼哥底母交谈，祂说，摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，使看见的人得救。我也必照样被举起来。

你不必在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、申命记中寻找某种弥赛亚预言。耶稣说，这都是关于我的。都是关于我的。

圣经将是一个灌木丛。它会看起来像矛盾。但如果你理解它都指向我，那么突然它就成为这种令人难以置信的统一。

## 圣经的生命力：通过基督得生命 / The Vitality of Scripture: Life Through Christ

There's no contradictions in it. And that leads lastly to the fact of its vitality. And what do I mean by vitality?

Look at this interesting place where Jesus seems to be telling them that they're both right and wrong about the Bible. Verse 39 and 40, you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life.

Now look carefully. Are they right and are they wrong about how they handle scripture? Both.

First of all, they're wrong because he says you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life, but they testify about me and you won't believe in me and therefore you refuse to come to me to have life. So here's what he's doing. They're both right and they're wrong.

Eternal life is in the scripture. And yet the message of the scripture is that through Jesus Christ you get eternal life. So here's what these folks were doing.

They didn't believe in Jesus, but they thought they could still get eternal life through the scripture. What did that mean? Probably it meant that they believed that by just knowing the scripture and by obeying the scripture, they were very diligent.

They would have been studying it day in and day out hours a day. They would have memorized it. They would have and they did.

They worked out everything the Bible said into seven, eight hundred, nine hundred thousand different laws. They did everything they could to be compliant with it. They tried and they tried and they tried.

Now here's here's the point. The Bible's a divine book. Not a jot or tittle will pass away unless it's all fulfilled.

It's all God's book. Yet it's possible to believe that and yet to miss the main message, which is you're not saved by obeying the Bible, but you're saved by the one to whom everything in the Bible points and what he has done. So if you actually see the Bible and have a high view of its authority and miss its point and fall into believing that through my study of it and through my obedience to it, I will be saved.

The Bible is just a book to you. It's just a book. Remember how I sometimes mention how Mark Twain who rejected Christianity used to have this nightmare about being asleep and waking up and finding this huge Bible on him bigger than him, weighing them down, crushing him and suffocating him.

What a vivid metaphor that is. But you see, frankly, the Bible, unless you see it's about Jesus, unless you see it's all about Jesus, it will destroy you. It'll either destroy you by making you such guilt over the fact you can't live up to it that you'll just abandon Christianity or it'll turn you into a Pharisee who only care about praise from others, not really from God, who are basically saving themselves by actually having their self-esteem rise as they think of themselves as biblically knowledgeable and obedient, rather than obeying the Bible out of love for God because they realize that they're saved by grace.

---

其中没有矛盾。这最后导致它的生命力的事实。我说的生命力是什么意思？

看这个有趣的地方，耶稣似乎在告诉他们，他们对圣经既对又错。第39和40节，你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生。给我作见证的就是这经。然而你们不肯到我这里来得生命。

现在仔细看。他们对他们如何处理圣经是对的还是错的？两者都是。

首先，他们错了，因为祂说你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生，但它们为我作见证，你们不信我，因此你们不肯到我这里来得生命。所以祂在做什么。他们既对又错。

永生在圣经中。然而圣经的信息是通过耶稣基督你得到永生。所以这些人在做什么。

他们不信耶稣，但他们认为他们仍然可以通过圣经得到永生。那意味着什么？可能意味着他们相信只要知道圣经和遵守圣经，他们就非常勤奋。

他们会一天几个小时日以继夜地学习它。他们会背诵它。他们确实这样做了。

他们把圣经所说的一切制定成七八百、九百一千条不同的律法。他们尽其所能遵守它。他们努力又努力又努力。

现在这里是重点。圣经是神圣的书。一点一画都不能废去，直到都成全了。

它都是神的书。然而有可能相信这一点，却错过主要信息，就是你不是通过遵守圣经得救，而是通过圣经中所有东西指向的那一位和祂所做的事得救。所以如果你实际上看圣经，对它的权威有很高的看法，却错过它的要点，陷入相信通过我对它的学习和我对它的顺服，我将得救。

圣经对你来说只是一本书。只是一本书。记得我有时提到马克·吐温如何拒绝基督教，他常常做这个噩梦，梦到睡着了，醒来发现这本巨大的圣经压在他身上，比他还大，压着他，粉碎他，使他窒息。

那是一个多么生动的隐喻。但你看，坦率地说，圣经，除非你看到它是关于耶稣的，除非你看到它都是关于耶稣的，它会摧毁你。它要么通过让你对你无法达到它的事实感到如此内疚而摧毁你，以至于你会放弃基督教，要么它会把你变成一个法利赛人，只关心别人的称赞，而不是真正来自神的称赞，基本上通过实际上当他们认为自己有圣经知识和顺服时，他们的自尊心上升而拯救自己，而不是出于对神的爱来顺服圣经，因为他们意识到他们是因恩典得救的。

## 通过神的话语寻见生命 / Finding Life Through the Word

Look, let me finish like this. If you are not sure what you believe or whether you believe in Christianity, then you ought to look at what Jesus offers. Jesus says, look at personal, empirical, and scriptural testimony.

Personal testimony. He says, look at John the Baptist. You say, well, I don't know John the Baptist.

No, but find some, you're never probably going to find faith unless you have some Christians that you admire in respect. That's the personal. Secondly, look at Jesus' actual life.

That's the empirical. Look at his resurrection. Look at what he actually did.

Study the New Testament documents. But then thirdly, the Scripture itself. If you don't use the Bible as an end, but a means to an end of finding Christ.

If you learn how to stand back and not look so much at everything, the Bible says only of the details but how the Bible is pointing also to the Lord, then it becomes something that gives life, clothes like this. I mean, if I sent a scientist friend of mine to the top of a mountain, I said, I want you to get up there and just see what you can see. If the person comes back down and says, well, I took some soil samples to try to figure out the consistency of the soil.

I took some samples of the bark of the trees up there. I checked out the visibility. It looked to me like there was 40% humidity.

It was a visibility 3.2 miles, but my guess is that you could probably from up there see 10.2 miles if the humidity was below. I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. You've missed the point.

When I go up there, the view is astounding. It restores my soul. That's what I wanted you to see.

I didn't want you to miss the forest for the trees. I didn't want you to miss the view for the soil samples. It's really quite important that you learn how to look at who Jesus is because that will give you life.

Even if you say, well, I've got eternal life, I'm a Christian. Every single day, someone talks about drawing life. By meditating on the word of God day and night, you're like a tree planted by water, drawing life from it.

Do you know how to do that? The way to do it is to realize Moses wrote of me, the scriptures testify to me. Everything we know about the authority of the Bible, the unity of the Bible, and the powerful vitality of the Bible rests on understanding Jesus Christ as the Lord of the Word.

Do you know how to do that? God give you the grace to understand these things and live by them. Let's pray.

Our Father, we ask that you would help us to see why in the Word of the Lord we find the Lord of the Word. It's because of the Lord of the Word that we can believe in the Word of the Lord. We ask that you would enable us now as a church to be people who know how to not only give a good answer when people criticize the authority of the Word, but to show that the Bible to us is not just a body of truth that we defend, but really it's our food, it's our drink, and it's our way of knowing you.

Lord, we pray that you would help us to love you through your Word and we pray that you would make your Word alive in our lives. We don't want to be like the people Jesus was talking about, but your Word doesn't dwell on us. We want your Word to dwell on us richly and we pray that you would help us in that regard.

Now, through your Holy Spirit, we ask it through Jesus and His name we pray. Amen. Great Gospel-centered resources.

看，让我这样结束。如果你不确定你相信什么或你是否相信基督教，那么你应该看看耶稣提供的。耶稣说，看个人的、经验的和圣经的见证。

个人见证。祂说，看施洗约翰。你说，我不认识施洗约翰。

不，但找一些，你可能永远不会找到信仰，除非你有一些你钦佩和尊敬的基督徒。那是个人的。其次，看耶稣的实际生活。

那是经验的。看祂的复活。看祂实际做了什么。

研究新约文献。但第三，圣经本身。如果你不把圣经当作目的，而是当作找到基督的手段。

如果你学会退后一步，不要只看圣经说的一切，只看细节，而是看圣经如何也指向主，那么它就成为给予生命的东西，像这样结束。我的意思是，如果我派一个科学家朋友到山顶，我说，我想让你上去，看看你能看到什么。如果这个人下来说，我取了一些土壤样本，试图弄清楚土壤的成分。

我取了一些那里树皮的样本。我检查了能见度。在我看来有40%的湿度。

能见度是3.2英里，但我的猜测是，如果湿度低于，你可能可以从那里看到10.2英里。我说，等一下，等一下。你错过了重点。

当我上去那里时，景色令人惊叹。它恢复我的灵魂。这就是我想让你看到的。

我不想让你只见树木不见森林。我不想让你因为土壤样本而错过景色。学会如何看耶稣是谁真的很重要，因为那会给你生命。

即使你说，我有永生，我是基督徒。每一天，有人谈论汲取生命。通过昼夜思想神的话语，你就像一棵栽在水旁的树，从中汲取生命。

你知道如何做到这一点吗？做到这一点的方法是意识到摩西指着我写，圣经为我作见证。我们所知道的关于圣经的权威、圣经的统一性和圣经强大生命力的一切，都建立在理解耶稣基督作为圣言之主的基础上。

你知道如何做到这一点吗？愿神赐给你恩典来理解这些事并凭此而活。让我们祷告。

我们的父，我们祈求你帮助我们明白为什么在主的话语中我们找到话语的主。正是因为话语的主，我们才能相信主的话语。我们祈求你现在使我们作为一个教会成为知道如何不仅在人们批评圣经的权威时给出好的答案，而且向他们展示圣经对我们来说不只是我们捍卫的一套真理，而是真正的，它是我们的食物，是我们的饮料，是我们认识你的方式的人。

主啊，我们祈求你帮助我们通过你的话语来爱你，我们祈求你使你的话语在我们的生命中活泼。我们不想成为耶稣所说的那些人，你的话语不住在我们里面。我们要你的话语丰丰富富地住在我们心里，我们祈求你在这方面帮助我们。

现在，通过你的圣灵，我们奉耶稣的名求这一切。阿们。美好的以福音为中心的资源。
