## 追求幸福的困境 / The Pursuit of Happiness

And when it was done, and my heart was literally broken, and you know what, okay, we're laughing, but you know, it was awful. What I said was, never again. I am never giving my heart to, okay, fill in the blank because you see, all of us have something like that.

Now, you know, there are people who to this day are not past the emotional level of a 13-year-old boy and it's still sports teams that are breaking their hearts. But for most of the rest of it, it's what? I'm never going to, you know, it's a man or a woman or it's love or it's career, it's success or something like that.

And what happens is because our hearts want joy and our hearts are like a big vacuum pump that has this enormous amount of sucking and it fixes itself on something that this is going to make me happy. And when it disappoints, then it will disappoint. See, it will not last.

Then you say, okay, the only way I'm ever going to get serenity is to stop pursuing joy and get what the philosopher is called detachment. In fact, that's what Buddhism is about. Buddhism is all about that.

And the old philosophers, the Greek philosophers, we're always about detachment. Don't give your heart to anything. And that's the only way you'll be serene.

Don't pursue joy. Don't pursue happiness. But there's a problem with that.

Joseph Epstein, who's a brilliant scholar, has taught English at Northwestern University for years, he was the editor of the American scholar and he's just retired. But recently, he wrote an article in the Notre Dame magazine. And in it, he recounts one of the great Greek philosophers, ancient Greek philosophers named Epicurus.

And at one point, Epicurus got his disciples together in his garden and said, I can give you a four step remedy for anxiety. I can eliminate anxiety from your life. You can just be completely serene if you just do these four things.

He says, I can eliminate anxiety in the world if everybody will do these four things. Would you like to know what they are? All right, well, okay.

Well, here's, and this is what Epstein says. He says, this is his summary of Epicurus' four steps. Step one, do not believe in God or in the gods.

Okay, why? Okay, step two. Therefore, now you don't have to worry about death.

Death, be assured, is oblivion. Nothing more than eternal dreamless sleep. See, there's no God or God.

There's no heaven or hell. You know, therefore, don't believe in God or gods. Therefore, death is not nothing to be afraid of.

Go and you die. It's like before you were born, just an eternal dreamless sleep. Step three, don't be afraid of pain.

Why? Because pain will either soon diminish and go away, or it will intensify in which case death is not far away and as we've already seen, that's no problem. And now step four, do not attempt to acquire things or money or fame or power.

Why? Don't try, don't set your heart on anything. Because if you, because if you try for them, you may not attain them, which of course will mean you're very unhappy.

But even if you do, he says, they never give you the value that is as great as what you spent trying to obtain them. The game is not worth the candle. So there's the summary and Epstein summarizes Epicurus' four steps for an anxiety-free life.

He says, forget about God, forget about death, forget about pain and forget about acquisition. And then he says, the only way to find serenity, according to the philosophers, is to stop seeking joy. Detach yourself from everything.

Don't attach your heart to anything. And here is what Epstein says. Conclusion, my guess is that this program would work.

But even if it did work, would such utter detachment from life constitute a life rich and complex enough to be worth living for? Many would say, yes, I am not among them. Now, actually, C.

S. Lewis has said a little bit more eloquently. He says, if you don't want your heart to be broken, if you always want serenity, don't give your heart to anything.

Don't give it to the Philadelphia Phillies. Don't give it to anything. Don't give it to a man or woman, anything.

Oh, he does mean you can't get married, but don't completely give your heart to anyone or anything. Put it in a little casket. You see, to make sure that it never breaks, but in that casket, it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, and irredeemable.

And see, what Epstein is saying, what C. S. Lewis is saying is, yes, on the one hand, if you give your heart to things, you're going to be disappointed.

So if you seek joy, you're going to be disappointed. But on the other hand, if you detach yourself and say, I'm not giving my heart to anything, that dehumanizes you. It hardens you.

Well, is there any way forward now? The answer is yes. Why?

Because it's a sermon, and that's only point one. Now there's point two. And point two is Christian joy is unique, and Christian joy gets you out of the dilemma.

How so? There's two ways the Christian joy is unique. And the first one is that Christian joy is not based in circumstances at all.

Look, what does it say in verse three? It says, we rejoice in our sufferings. What?

Now what are sufferings? Sufferings, suffering is favorable circumstances going away. Now here's the place where I think I'm going to part ways with the word happiness, if you don't mind, because I actually don't believe that Christian joy is what the world calls happiness.

What the world calls happiness is, getting control of your life so that you keep your circumstances favorable. Did you know that there is a happiness.com? And at happiness.com, there is this, the surefire top five components for happiness.

All right? Five things, if you get put these in place, you're happy. Number one, it says be in possession of the basics.

Food, shelter, good health, and in safety. Number two, get enough sleep. All right.

Sure, fine. Three, have relationships that matter to you, four, take compassionate care of others and yourself, and five, have work that really interested engages you. Okay?

So get the basics, food, shelter, good health. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? You say, what do you mean ridiculous?

Sure, you need all that to be happy. Sure, you need that to be happy. Most people, most places, most centuries have never had that.

当这一切结束时，我的心真的碎了。我们都在笑，但你知道，那真的很糟糕。我说过，再也不了。我再也不会把我的心交给任何人——填空吧，因为你们知道，我们每个人都有类似的经历。

现在，有些人直到今天仍然处于13岁男孩的情感水平，他们的心还是被体育队所伤。但对于大多数人来说，是什么呢？我再也不……是人、是爱情、是事业、是成功，或者其他什么。结果是，我们的内心渴望快乐，就像一个巨大的真空泵，有着极强的吸引力，它会把注意力集中在某样东西上，以为这将使我快乐。

但当它失望时，它就会失望。你看，它不会持久。所以你可能会说，唯一的办法就是停止追求快乐，学会一种哲学家所说的超然。事实上，这就是佛教的核心思想。

佛教全部关于这一点。古希腊的哲人总是提倡超然。不要把心交给任何东西。这才是获得宁静的唯一途径。

不要追求快乐，不要追求幸福。但这样做的问题在于…… 约瑟夫·埃普斯登是一位才华横溢的学者，多年来一直在西北大学教授英语。他曾担任《美国学者》杂志的主编，并刚刚退休。但最近他在《诺特丹杂志》上发表了一篇文章。

在这篇文章中，他讲述了古希腊伟大哲学家伊壁鸠鲁的故事。在某个时刻，伊壁鸠鲁召集了他的门徒们，在他的花园里说：“我可以给你们提供一个四步疗法来消除焦虑。我可以让你们的生活完全平静下来，只要你们做到这四件事。” 他说：“如果每个人都做这些事情，我就可以消除全世界的焦虑。

”你想知道它们是什么吗？好的，好吧。这就是埃普斯登所说的。他总结了伊壁鸠鲁的四步法：第一步，不要相信上帝或诸神的存在。

为什么呢？第二步，因此你不必担心死亡。死亡就是无知无觉的永恒睡眠。没有上帝，也没有天堂和地狱。

所以，不要相信上帝或诸神。因此，死亡就没有什么好害怕的了。去吧，你死了就像在出生之前一样，只是永恒的无知无觉的睡眠。第三步，不要害怕痛苦。

为什么呢？因为痛苦要么很快就会减轻并消失，要么会加剧，在这种情况下，死亡就不远了，而正如我们已经看到的那样，这并不是什么问题。现在第四步，不要试图追求财富、金钱、名声或权力。为什么呢？

不要尝试，不要把心放在任何东西上。因为如果你努力去追求它们，你可能得不到，当然**这意味着你会非常不快乐。**但即使你能得到它们，他说，这些也无法给你带来你所付出的努力和代价相等的价值。得不偿失。

所以这就是伊壁鸠鲁的四步法总结。他说道，忘记上帝、忘记死亡、忘记痛苦和忘记追求。然后他又说，根据哲学家的说法，找到平静的唯一方法就是停止寻求快乐，与一切事物保持距离。不要将心系于任何事物之上。

而这里，埃普斯坦是这么说的。结论，我的猜测是这个项目会有效果。但即便如此，这样的彻底与生活脱离是否足以构成一个值得为之活出精彩丰富的人生？很多人可能会说可以，但我并不认同。

实际上，C.S.刘易斯说得更为优雅一些。他说，如果你不想心碎，总是想要宁静，那么就不要将心系于任何事物之上。不要将它交给费城人棒球队，不要将它交给任何人或事。哦，他确实意思是不能结婚，但不要完全将心系于某个人或某件事上。

把它放在一个小匣子里。你看，这样可以确保它不会碎裂，但在那个匣子里，它会变得不可破碎、无法穿透和无法救赎。而埃普斯坦所说的，C.S.刘易斯所说的正是：一方面，如果你将心系于事物之上，你会失望；所以如果你追求快乐，你就会失望。但另一方面，如果你与世隔绝，说不给任何东西或任何人以心灵上的投入，那会使人变得麻木和硬化。

那么现在有没有出路呢？答案是有的。为什么？因为这是一场布道，这是第一个要点。

现在进入第二个要点。第二个要点是：基督徒的快乐是独特的，并且这种快乐可以让你摆脱困境。它是如何做到这一点的呢？基督徒的快乐有两点独特之处。

首先，基督徒的快乐并不基于任何境况之上。看，经文第三节怎么说？它说：“我们在患难中也喜乐。”什么？

那么什么是患难？患难就是有利条件的消失。现在我想我将要与“幸福”这个词分道扬镳了，如果你不介意的话，因为我实际上并不认为基督徒的快乐是世俗所说的幸福。世俗所谓的幸福是指掌控你的人生，使你的境况保持有利状态。

你知道吗，有一个happiness.com网站？在happiness.com上，列出了确保幸福的五大法宝。好的？五件事，如果你把这些都做好了，你就会快乐。

第一，圣经上说要拥有基本的生活条件。食物、住所、良好的健康和安全。第二，保证充足的睡眠。好的。

当然可以。第三，拥有一些对你重要的关系；第四，对他人的关爱以及自我关怀；第五，从事真正让你感兴趣的工作。好的？所以先解决基本问题，比如食物、住所、健康和安全。

你意识到这有多荒谬吗？你说，你指的是什么荒谬？当然，要快乐你就需要这些。当然，要快乐你就需要这些。

## 超越环境的喜乐 / Joy Beyond Circumstances

What are we going to do about all the people who could never get enough food, shelter, good health, and safety today? They'll never will have it. You talk about engaging and interesting work.

In other words, what this is saying, and this is what the world believes, happiness is getting my circumstances in the right place. I'm happy if things are going well. Circumstances are favorable.

But what about most of the people and most of the times and most of the places that never have favorable circumstances like that? Are they doomed to no happiness? Yes, they're doomed to no happiness as you and I define happiness in this culture today.

A joy is available to them. And that Christian joy is not based on circumstances at all. In fact, look, when it says we rejoice in suffering, it doesn't mean, by the way, it's not saying you rejoice for your suffering.

You don't say, we, I'm suffering. Hey, that's great. That's masochism.

Forget that way. It says we rejoice in our suffering. Well, how can you rejoice in your suffering?

Of all your circumstances are going bad. Verse 11, you rejoice in God. And he's not susceptible.

He's not subject to circumstances. But here's what's really interesting about verse 3 and 4. It says, you rejoice in suffering with why?

Because suffering produces stronger endurance. Perseverance means character and perseverance and encourage. And that leads to more hope.

And that hope is in the future glory of God, which makes us rejoice the verse 2 B says we rejoice in the future glory of God. We'll get there in a minute. Verse 3 says suffering can actually give you more of that hope and therefore more of that joy.

And what this is saying is, Christian joy, unlike worldly happiness, not only can be maintained when all circumstances go unfavorable, but it can also grow. In fact, it does usually grow. You say, how can that be?

Christian joy can grow when things are bad. The worldly happiness goes away when things are bad. Why?

Because it's based in good circumstances. But Christian joy can actually get stronger. How?

Well, don't you remember how your mother used to always say? Don't eat that candy before meals. You know, if she would ever want it anytime within about 30 minutes before you're about to eat, you know, a meal, your mother would be all over if you're eating potato chips or candy or anything sweet or anything like that.

Why? She says, it'll ruin your appetite. And mothers aren't always right.

Mothers are never in, you know, often wrong, but never in doubt. However, they are right about this. And that is the trouble with eating candy is it gives you a sugar buzz and you don't feel hungry, but it masks the fact that your body needs proteins and it needs all kinds of stuff that you don't have.

Candy gives you a sugar buzz that masks the fact that your body needs nutrients that you're not giving it and sex and money and power and success. Favorable circumstances are spiritual sugar. And what happens to Christians is you say, oh, I believe in God and I know I'm going to heaven whatever, but you actually base your day-to-day joy and happiness on circumstances and when the circumstances go away, it drives you into God because when the sugar goes away, when the candy goes away, you're forced to go after the feast that your soul really needs to get the nutrients your soul really needs.

What happens when things go bad is it drives you into God and you develop a poise, you develop a power, you develop a strong kind of joy that never goes away regardless of circumstances. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God. Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death.

In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start and if you already spend time and study in prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people.

Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com-slash-give that's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

So first of all, Christian joy is unique because it's not based on circumstances. It's not grounded in circumstances, but secondly, Christian joy is unique because it's already but not yet. It's already but not yet.

Look, on the one hand, verse 2b says, we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Now what's that mean? It means when you become a Christian because your salvation is not based in your good works and your efforts.

There's a certainty you've got about your future. See, remember what we said about all the religions, all of the religions say, if you live as you want, then God will bless you, which means in every if you believe the reason God blesses me, the reason I believe I have a relationship with God is because I've lived a good life and I'm living a good life and I'm praying and I'm doing all these things. That means you have no certainty about your future, spiritually speaking because what if you give up or what if you don't keep it up?

You can't be sure because you haven't gotten into your life yet and you might fail or you might do something. So religion in which your salvation essentially is earned by you creates an uncertainty about your future. But Christianity says there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and it's absolutely certain that someday you will share in the hope of the glory of God that you'll live in the world before him and this world is going to be completely renewed and when you get there, the moment you get there, you're going to stamp your foot and you're going to say, I've come home at last.

This is my real country. I belong here. This is the land I've been looking for all my life and I never knew it till now.

And the knowledge of that, the knowledge of that, it's not yet but it's there, it's coming. The word hope in the Bible does not mean hope so, it's not an uncertainty. Hope in the Bible is life-shaping certainty of something that you're going to have but you don't have it yet.

But even the stories about it and the thoughts about it and the biblical texts about it and our understanding of that future is grounding. See, it's poised creating. When other circumstances are going away, becoming unfavorable, we know about the hope of the glory of God.

That's not yet but is that all we have? We just know what's going to happen. We just think about it.

So when we're suffering, we just say, I know in the future it's going to be better. Is that it? No, that's not all we have because look carefully.

Verse 4 and 5. It says, suffering produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope and our hope does not disappoint us why because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who he has given us. What does that word pour out mean?

Does that mean the Holy Spirit just tells us that God loves us? Does that mean that we know that God loves us? We already know God loves us.

What is this talking about? The poor out metaphor is a way of expressing experience. And this is saying that sometimes that feast that we know we're going to have in the future, we get an order of now.

Sometimes that glory that we're going to have in the future, sometimes you experience it now. And this is at the very heart of the Christian joy that's available to you through Christ, through the faith of Christ, through the Holy Spirit. It's a foretaste of that glory.

Some of the old people, I mean some of the old British pastors like Richard Sibs and William Guthrie write about it like this. Listen, this is 17th century English but so work with it. Here he says, Richard Sibs says, sometimes our spirits cannot stand in trials.

So the immediate testimony of the Spirit comes to us saying, I am thy salvation and our hearts are stirred up and comforted with joy inexpressible. This joy has degrees. Sometimes it's so clear and strong that we question nothing and other times doubts come in soon.

大多数人都在大多数地方，在大多数世纪里从未拥有过这些东西。那么我们怎么对待那些今天还无法获得足够食物、住所、良好健康和安全的人呢？他们永远也不会有这些。你说起有趣的工作。

换句话说，这就是世界所相信的，幸福就是让我的处境变得正确。如果一切顺利我就快乐；如果环境有利我就快乐。但是大多数时候和大多数地方的人们，他们的处境从来不是那么有利，他们注定没有幸福吗？是的，他们注定不会按照我们今天这种文化定义的幸福。

有一种喜悦对他们来说是可用的，并且这种基督徒的喜悦完全不依赖于任何情况。事实上，看这里，当圣经说我们要在患难中喜乐时，它并不是要你为你的苦难而喜乐。你不能说：“我正在受苦。”嘿，这很棒。

这是自虐。忘掉那种想法。圣经上说要在患难中喜乐。那么你怎么能在处境糟糕的情况下喜乐呢？

所有的情况都不好，但你可以在神中喜乐。诗篇30章11节说：“你要将耶和华你的神常摆在我面前。”神不受环境影响。他不会被情况所左右。

但这里真正有趣的是第3节和4节的内容。它说你们要在患难中有喜乐，为什么？因为患难会产生更坚强的忍耐力。忍耐意味着品格和毅力，并且鼓励你。

这会带来更多的希望。并且这种希望在于上帝未来的荣耀，使我们欢欣。正如第2节所说，我们要为上帝的未来荣耀而欢喜。我们稍后会谈到。

第3节说，苦难实际上可以给你带来更多的希望，因此也带来更多的喜乐。这说明了基督徒的喜乐与世俗的快乐不同，不仅能在不利的情况下保持不变，还能增长。事实上，它通常会增长。你可能会问：怎么可能？

当事情不顺时，基督徒的喜乐反而能增强。而世俗的快乐在坏事发生时就会消失。为什么呢？因为世俗的快乐基于良好的环境。

但基督徒的喜乐却能在逆境中变得更加强烈。这是为什么呢？你还记得妈妈以前总是怎么说吗？饭前不要吃糖果。

你知道，如果她希望你30分钟内不吃薯片、糖果或任何甜食或其他类似的东西，她会非常在意。为什么呢？她说这样会影响你的食欲。然而，母亲并不总是对的。

母亲有时候可能不对，但她们从不怀疑自己的话。不过，在这一点上她们是对的。吃糖果之所以麻烦是因为它会让你血糖升高而没有饥饿感，但它掩盖了你身体需要蛋白质和其他各种营养的事实。糖果给你带来的只是短暂的甜味，却掩盖了你身体真正需要的营养——包括精神上的营养。

比如信仰、上帝和永恒的生命。当好的环境（即“糖”）消失时，基督徒就会被逼迫去追求灵魂真正需要的东西，就像在没有糖果的情况下，你的身体会渴望那些它真正需要的营养一样。> 世俗的快乐基于良好的环境，而基督徒的喜乐则能在逆境中增长。当事情变得糟糕时，这会将你引向神，并使你在各种情况下都能保持一种平和、力量和永不消逝的强烈喜乐。

诗篇可以深刻地塑造你与神交往的方式。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。在提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒撰写的《一年365天灵修》中，你可以找到每天通过诗篇的阅读，并获得新的圣经见解。如果你没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始方式；如果你已经花时间在祷告中研读圣经，那么阅读并祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，发现与祂更深的亲密关系。

作为您对福音与生命事工的支持表示感谢，我们将赠送您提摩太和凯瑟琳·凯勒的灵修书籍。请访问 gospelandlife.com-slash-give（gospelandlife.com-slash-give）获取您的副本。现在，请听凯勒博士继续今天的教导。首先，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它不基于环境。

它不是建立在环境中，但其次，基督徒的喜乐是独特的，因为它已经存在但尚未完全实现。看，在一方面，第2节下半句说：“我们在神荣耀里的盼望中欢喜。”**这意味着当你成为基督徒时，因为你的救赎并不是基于你的好行为和努力。**你对未来有一个确定性。

请记住我们之前所说的关于所有宗教的观点：所有的宗教都说，如果你按照自己的意愿生活，那么神就会赐福给你，**这意味着在每一种情况下，我相信我与神的关系是因为我过了一种好生活，并且我正在继续这样做，我在祷告，我在做这些事情。**这就意味着你在精神上对未来没有任何确定性，因为你可能会放弃，或者可能无法坚持下去。你不能确定，因为你还没有真正经历你的生活，可能会失败或者做错事。所以那种靠你自己赚取救赎的宗教会让你对未来充满不确定性。

但基督教说，在基督耶稣里的人现在没有任何定罪，而且可以肯定地说，有一天你会分享神荣耀的盼望，并在神面前生活在一个全新的世界里。当你到达那里时，你一到那里就会跺脚，说：“我终于回家了。” 这是我真正的国家。我属于这里。

这是我一生都在寻找的土地，直到现在我才明白。这种知识，这种知识，虽然尚未到来，但它就在那里，它正在来临。圣经中的“希望”这个词并不意味着不确定，“希望”是生活塑造的确定性，你知道你将来会拥有某样东西，但你现在还没有。但这不仅仅是关于它的故事和想法以及圣经中对未来的描述，而是我们的理解使我们扎根。

你看，当其他情况消失或变得不利时，我们知道神荣耀的盼望。这还不是全部吗？我们只知道未来会发生什么，只是想一想而已。所以当我们受苦时，我们说：“我知道将来会更好。

”这就是全部了吗？不，我们还有更多。请仔细看看第4节和第5节： “患难生忍耐，忍耐生 character，character 生希望；我们的希望不至于落空，因为神在基督里向我们所显的是爱，他将那爱浇灌在我们心里。”——《罗马书》5:3-5 这个“浇灌”是什么意思？

这是否意味着圣灵只是告诉我们神爱我们？或者**这意味着我们知道神爱我们？我们已经知道神爱我们。**这句话在说什么呢？

## 荣耀的预尝 / Foretastes of Glory

William Guthrie says, it's not an audible voice. We don't hear an audible voice. Rather, what we're talking about here is a ray of glory filling the soul.

It's like the word of Jesus to Mary. The Lord only said her name in the garden, Mary. And it filled her soul so she no longer doubted she was his.

How glorious is this manifestation of the Spirit. You will not have the Christian joy that roots and grounds you no matter what the circumstances. You will tend to simply rely on worldly happiness which is based on favorable circumstances which of course is so fragile.

You will not have the Christian joy unless sometimes you have experiences of the love of God direct to your heart through prayer. It's the foretaste of that. It's the already foretaste of the not yet.

And you heard what Richard said. It doesn't happen a lot. It doesn't happen constantly.

Sometimes it's very high. Sometimes it's kind of low and it goes away fast. But you know it.

When you have those experiences, I know it's weird to have a Presbyterian minister saying this. When you have those experiences that goes along with your knowledge because I know I'm saved by grace, I know that the glory of God is my destiny. And yet at the same time I've got a subject that is well as an objective nature.

It might not only have my mind. I've got my heart. And the Bible says Christian joy gives you what you need both head and heart.

And do you not see now? How this in a sense answers the dilemma we talked about in the first point. Because the first point dilemma is this.

Things in this world are great. And yet if we give our heart to them, then we get disappointed. So then we detach.

And then we don't rejoice in things. C. S.

Lewis's autobiography is called Surprise by Joy. And it's all about the fact that before he was a Christian, he was always trying to find joy in other things. And whenever he found something he thought would give him joy, he binged on it.

So for example, the first time he read an Icelandic saga. He loved it. And he started to say, oh I want to get that feeling back.

I have when I read it. It was so exciting. So what he did to do, he reads every Icelandic saga.

And then he goes and learns old Norse so he can read it in the original. And yet as he works through it, he comes to realize well somehow the joy I thought was going to give me never comes through. And then suddenly he gets a friend.

And you know sometimes there's nothing more wonderful than a great evening talking with a friend. And you come back feeling so good. And when he first made it, he would get a friend and he would binge on the friend.

Every night, let's get together. Let's talk. After a while the friend saying, whoa, maybe not tonight.

Or maybe not for a while. He would binge. And at one point, he becomes, he starts to realize that there's a god behind the joy.

And as he was getting converted as he was sort of moving toward becoming a Christian, he says this at one point. He says the book, I came to realize that the books are the music in which I thought the beauty and the joy was located betrayed me if I trusted in them. The joy was not in them.

It only came through them. These things, these things, the joy, the beauty, if they're mistaken for the thing itself, the things that give it through which it comes. If they're mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols breaking the hearts of their worshipers.

For they are not the joy itself, these things that bring it. They are only the scent of a flower we haven't found yet. The echo of a tune we have not heard yet.

The news from a country we haven't visited yet. And at the very end, the last chapter, the last page of his autobiographies, become a Christian. And here's what he says.

It's very, very interesting. He says, for many years, he thought the joy is here, the joy is here. And he would go to that landscape or that set of friends or that book or that writing or whatever.

And then he came to realize it was from God. And the joy was coming through the things. And then he ends with this fascinating illustration.

I want to tell what I would give you because I think it actually answers the problem. He says, if you are lost in the woods, and you first come upon a signpost, it's a big deal. The one who first sees the signpost in the woods says, look, and the whole party gathers around and stares and says, ah, finally, that's the direction.

But if you found the road, and if you're passing signposts every few miles, you don't stop and stare at the signposts. They encourage you. And you will be grateful to the authority that set them up.

But we will not stop and stare at the signposts or at least not too much, though their pillars are of silver and their lettering is of gold. Why? Because we would rather be in Jerusalem.

See his point. He says, if you really are lost when you find a signpost, you get pretty excited about it. But when you know your way, when you know the thing to which the signpost point, that's where you're on your way.

And you don't stop and look at the signposts. And what do you realize is food, friends, success, acclaim, popularity, money, all the things that we think, if I have that, that's going to give me the joy, our signposts. So enjoy them.

Some of them are great. There are some of them are made of silver with letters of gold. But don't mistake the signposts for what they're signing, the thing they're pointing to, which is the city of God, which is God himself.

And that gets you out of either being afraid of enjoying things in this life or at the same time resting your heart too much in them. And let's final question. How do you really get this joy?

Because I've been all long saying Christian joy is like this and Christian joy is like that. Well, how do you get Christian joy? You say, well, I guess become a Christian.

Well, let's be a little more specific because I know an awful lot of Christians that don't have much of the joy. And here's what I'd like you to see. The last part of the passage, the last part, is, you know, worth five or six sermons.

And by the way, there's plenty of people who preach five or six sermons on these, you know, verses. However, the essence of them is the gospel. And in verses eight and nine, there's a beautiful little summary of what the gospel is while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

That we might be saved from God's wrath. Now God's wrath is it's not just crankiness. God's wrath is his judicial opposition to evil.

His settled judicial opposition to injustice and evil. And the human race deserves punishment because we have participated in evil and injustice. But Jesus Christ, while we were still sinners, that's grace.

贫穷的比喻是一种表达经历的方式。这里的意思是，有时候那个我们在未来将要享有的盛宴，现在就开始了。有时候，我们将来要拥有的荣耀，你现在已经可以体验到。这正是通过基督、基督的信仰和圣灵你可以获得的基督徒喜乐的核心。

这是一种对那荣耀的预尝。一些年长的牧师，比如17世纪的英国牧师理查德·西伯斯（Richard Sibbes）和威廉·古德里（William Guthrie），就是这样描述的。请跟我一起听一下这段17世纪的英语吧。理查德·西伯斯说：“在试炼中，我们的灵不能站立。

” 圣灵立刻向我们见证说：我是你的救赎。我们的心被无法言喻的喜乐所感动和安慰。这种喜乐有不同程度。有时候它如此清晰强烈，以至于我们对任何事情都不怀疑；而其他时候，则会有疑虑。

威廉·古德里说：“这不是一个听得见的声音。”我们并没有听到一个听得见的声音。这里所说的是一种荣耀之光充满灵魂的景象。就像耶稣对玛利亚所说的话一样。

主只是在花园中叫了她的名字，玛丽亚。这句话充满了她的心灵，以至于她不再怀疑他是谁。这种圣灵的表现是多么荣耀啊！无论在什么情况下，你都不会失去扎根于你的基督徒喜乐。

否则，你会依赖世俗的快乐，而它基于的是有利的情况，当然这是非常脆弱的。除非有时你经历到上帝直接赐予你的心的爱，否则你不会有这种基督徒的喜乐。这正是预尝，是“已经”与“未至”的预尝。正如理查德所说，这种情况并不经常发生，并不是一直都在。

有时候它非常高涨，有时候则比较低落且很快消失。但你知道那是怎么回事。当你有这些体验时，我知道一个长老会牧师这么说有点奇怪。但是当这些体验伴随着你的知识时，因为我知道我是因恩典得救的，我知道上帝的荣耀是我的命运。

同时，我也有作为主体和客观性质的自己。我的喜乐不仅影响我的理智，也影响我的心。圣经说，基督徒的喜乐可以满足你头与心的需求。现在你看明白了吗？

这在某种意义上回答了我们在第一个问题中提到的困境。因为这个困境是这样的： 这个世界上的事情都很伟大。然而，如果我们把心给了它们，就会失望。于是我们就与它们分离。

然后我们不再因这些事而欢喜。C.S.刘易斯的自传叫做《被惊喜的快乐》。在这本书里，他讲述了自己在成为基督徒之前，总是试图从其他事物中寻找快乐。每当他认为某样东西能给他带来快乐时，他就沉迷于其中。

比如，第一次读到冰岛传说时，他非常喜欢。于是他说：“我想要再次体验这种感觉。”那真是如此令人兴奋。所以他开始阅读所有的冰岛传说。

然后他又去学习古诺斯语，以便能够用原文阅读这些书籍。然而，在他深入研究的过程中，他逐渐意识到，那种快乐并没有如他所愿地到来。有一天，他交了一个朋友。你知道有时候和一个好朋友共度美好夜晚是多么美妙的事情。

回来后你会感觉很好。当他第一次这样做时，他会频繁地找朋友聚会聊天。每晚都让咱们聚一聚，聊聊天。但过了一段时间，朋友开始说：“或许今晚不行。

”或者“也许过一段时间再聊吧。”他还是会沉迷其中。最终，他意识到快乐背后其实有一个神。在他逐渐皈依基督教的过程中，他说过这样一句话：我渐渐认识到，我认为藏在书中的美丽和快乐背叛了我，如果我把希望寄托于它们身上，真正的快乐并不在那里。

它只是通过这些事物显现出来。这些东西，这些快乐、美好，如果我们误以为它们本身就是快乐的源泉，那么它们就会变成愚蠢的偶像，伤害信徒的心。因为这些东西并不是快乐本身，而是我们尚未找到的花朵的气息，是我们还未听到的旋律的回响。来自一个我们尚未访问过的国家的消息。

在他的自传最后一章，最后一页，他成为了基督徒。他说： 这非常有趣。他说，多年来，他认为快乐在这里，在这里。他会去那个风景、那群朋友、那本书或那份写作。

然后他意识到，快乐来自于上帝，是通过那些事物传递出来的。他在结尾用了一个有趣的比喻。我想告诉你们我想要分享的内容，因为它实际上回答了这个问题。他说，如果你在森林里迷路了，首先看到一个指路牌是一件大事。

第一个发现森林中指路牌的人会说：“看！”整个队伍都会围过来，看着并说：“啊，终于有了方向。” 但如果你找到了道路，并且每隔几英里就会经过指路牌，你不会停下来盯着它们看。这些指路牌鼓励着你前进，你会感激设立它们的权威。

但我们不会停下来盯着指路牌看太久，尽管它们的柱子是银色的，文字是金色的。为什么？因为我们更愿意到达耶路撒冷。看看他的观点：他说，如果你真的迷路了，在找到指路牌时会非常兴奋。

但当你知道方向，知道那些指路牌所指向的目标时，你就会继续前进。你就不会停下来盯着指路牌看。你会发现，食物、朋友、成功、赞誉、名声、金钱，所有我们认为有了它们就能带来快乐的事物，其实只是指路牌。享受它们吧。

有些指路牌很棒，柱子是银色的，文字是金色的。但不要把指路牌误认为它所指向的东西——上帝之城，也就是上帝本身。这样你既不会害怕享受今生的事物，也不会过度依赖它们。让我们最后一个问题：你怎么真正得到这种快乐？

因为我一直说，基督徒的喜乐是这样的和那样的。那你们怎么得到这种喜乐呢？有人可能会说：“那我得成为基督徒。” 好吧，我们再具体一点。

## 福音带来喜乐 / The Gospel Brings Joy

Not because we cleaned up our life. While we're still sinners, Jesus Christ took the wrath. He took the condemnation.

He took the punishment. And that's the gospel. How does that bring joy?

Two ways. And these are very important in their practical number one, the gospel shows you the magnitude of your danger. Now this is counterintuitive because from the outside, the gospel, the first part of the gospel, which is you're a sinner, you're lost, you deserve punishment, you deserve wrath.

That sounds negative. Gee, why would you consider that negative? Well, of course it sounds negative.

But you know what that means on the inside. On the inside, we realize the size of the debt and the magnitude of the danger we were in, which we weren't aware of before. One preacher put it like this.

He says, imagine that you went away and a friend of yours was staying in your home. And when you came back, your friend said, you know what? A bill came for you.

And I opened it. I hope you don't mind. And I saw what the bill was.

And I paid it for you. I paid it out of my own money. And the preacher says, okay, now, how should you respond?

And the answer is, you have no idea how to respond. You know why you don't know why you're out of respond? Because you don't know the size of the debt.

You don't know how big the bill was. Was it postage due on this package? Then you would have said, oh, thank you.

That was very kind of you. But what if the IRS finally found where you lived? And that was the bill for back taxes that you know you have no resources of your own to fulfill that bill.

And that was paid for. In other words, the preacher says, until you know the size of the bill and the size of the debt, you don't know whether you to say, hi, thank you very much, were to fall at his feet as dead saying, you saved me. You don't know how grateful to be.

You don't know how joyful to be until you know how bad you bad off it was, right? And JC Ryle, the old Bishop of Liverpool says, one of the reasons why you get so upset over the debts, your financial debts, your financial problems is you don't realize that the great debt, the only debt that debt of sin, the only debt that could really sink you has been paid. And when you see that, then all other debts, no matter how great they seem to be, you are little.

You follow that. See, from the outside, the idea that you're more wicked than you ever did believe and you deserve wrath, you deserve to be punished. That sounds like bad news from the inside.

Once you believe in the gospel and you see that all those years, the sort of damnacles was over your head and you never knew was about to fall. When you see the magnitude of the debt, the magnitude of your danger and you realize what you were delivered from, it inflicts a joy on you that never goes away. That is, if that sounds odd to you, it's because you're not deeply on the inside.

You really haven't come on the inside. You haven't really accepted that. If you accept the bad news of the gospel that you're a sinner needing salvation from the inside, it creates a joy that says, you know what?

Okay, I've got debts. I've got diseases, but the only debt that can really sink me has been paid and the only disease that can really kill me eternally has been healed. And even cancer can't do that.

It can't really sink me because if I belong to him, I've got the hope of the glory of God. The real disease has been healed. The real debt has been cancelled.

And so the first thing that the gospel does is it shows you the magnitude of your danger, but the second thing it shows you is the magnitude of Jesus' pain. There's a weird place, and I do consider it weird, in John chapter 16, where Jesus is trying to comfort his disciples the night before he's about to die. And he's trying to say, look, look, you know, this is going to be hard on you.

But then he says, a woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come. But when the baby is born, joy for a child is born into the world. And so it is with you.

What is he saying? And I looked it up because every time I look at that passage, I always look at the commentators to make sure I'm not imagining all the commentators agree. Jesus Christ is identifying with a woman.

And here's what you have to remember. Nowadays, most women have babies have some pain, but there are these things called epidurals and things like that. But in those days, not only did women never give birth except through excruciating pain, but women constantly died in childbirth all the time.

And what that meant was the only way for a woman to give birth to a new baby and the joy of a new life was for her to go into a tunnel of anguish and pain and danger. And Jesus Christ says, that's what's happening to me as I'm going to the cross. I'm like the woman who's giving birth to joy and a new life by going through all this anguish.

And here's how you develop joy. You look and say, Lord Jesus, you lost all joy that I could have eternal joy. You experience enormous anguish so I could have new life.

And that's how the love comes. Here's verse 5. It says, this is the key to joy that sometimes the Holy Spirit pours the love of God out on your heart.

And you know how that happens? Here's how it happens. Don't say, oh, okay, Lord, make me feel loved.

I'm waiting. That's abstract. That's not what happens.

How does it happen? You look at what Jesus has done. You look at him saying, I'm like the woman who lost her life to bring new life.

I like the woman who lost all joy to bring you joy. You look at what he has done for you. And that's what sometimes by the power of the Holy Spirit inflicts a joy on you in a sense of how loved you are.

That makes you able to handle anything in life no matter what the circumstances are. That's it. To the two things, the two ways the gospel gives you joy is it shows you the magnitude of your danger was so great that all your other problems seem small by comparison to the one problem which has been solved already.

And number two, you see what Jesus has done for you. You see what he's given up. You see how he lost all joy to give you joy.

And as you meditate on that and as you pray over that day in and day out, sometimes the Holy Spirit gives you a sense of God's love on your heart that it gives you the power to handle anything. And that's how it works. Go get it.

It's available. Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us joy and giving us the capacity for far greater joy than we have.

Lord, I pray that anyone here who has not really come on to the inside of belief in the gospel has not really received it, has not really accepted it, has not really come to know you by faith. It's not really experienced justification. I pray that they would and that they would therefore begin to understand this joy.

Joy in the face of the future, joy in the face of suffering, joy before you. But I also pray, Lord, for all the rest of us who already believe, but to great degree are relying on worldly circumstances for our happiness. Give us this joy, root us and ground us in joy.

Give us an experience of your love so that we can have the joy that Jesus had for the joy that was set before him. He endured the cross. And for the joy that you have given us we can do or anything because he endured that for us.

It's in his name that we pray. Amen. Thanks for listening to Tim Keller on the Gospel Online Podcast.

我知道有很多基督徒并没有太多喜乐。我要让你们看到的是，这段经文的最后一部分，值得讲五六个 sermon。顺便说一句，很多人都会讲五六个 sermon 来解释这些经文，但它们的核心是福音。在第八和第九节中，有一个关于福音的美丽总结：当我们还是罪人的时候，基督为我们死了。

这样我们就可以从神的忿怒中得救了。现在，神的忿怒不仅仅是愤怒的情绪。神的忿怒是对邪恶的司法反对，对不义和邪恶的坚定司法反对。人类理应受惩罚，因为我们参与了邪恶和不义。

但当我们在罪人的时候，耶稣基督为我们承担了这一切。这就是福音。那它如何带来喜乐呢？有两种方式。

这两种方式在实际应用中非常重要。第一种方式是：福音让你意识到你所面临的危险有多大。这听起来似乎有些反直觉，因为从外面看，福音的前半部分告诉你你是罪人，你是失丧的，你理应受罚，理应受到神的忿怒。这听起来很消极。

天哪，为什么你会觉得这是消极的呢？当然听起来是消极的。但你知道**这意味着什么吗？在内心深处，我们意识到自己所欠的债务和面临的危险有多大，而在此之前我们并不知道这些。**

有一位牧师这样比喻： 他说：想象一下，你离开了家，你的一个朋友住在你的房子里。当你回来的时候，你的朋友说：“你知道吗？有一张账单是给你的。” 他打开了它，并希望你不介意。

然后他看到账单的内容，并用自己的钱为你付了账。这位牧师说，现在，你应该怎样回应呢？答案是，你完全不知道该如何回应。你之所以不知道如何回应，是因为你没有意识到自己欠下的债务有多大。

你根本不知道账单有多么巨大。如果只是邮费欠款，你会说：“谢谢您。”但如果你知道税务局最终找到了你的住址，并且那笔账单是你无法用个人资源偿还的滞纳金，情况就大不相同了。换句话说，牧师说，直到你知道这笔债务的规模和你所欠的金额，你才会明白是该说“非常感谢”，还是应该跪倒在地，说“您救了我”。

你不会知道有多么感激，有多么欢欣，除非你知道自己之前的情况有多糟糕。JC·里尔，利物浦的老主教曾说过，你之所以会对财务债务、财务问题感到如此焦虑不安，是因为你没有意识到真正的债务——罪孽的债务已经得到了偿还。当你看到这一点时，所有其他看似巨大的债务对你来说都变得微不足道。你看懂了吗？

从外面看，觉得自己比想象中更邪恶，应该受到惩罚，这听起来像是坏消息。但一旦相信了福音，并意识到那些年头悬在你头上、从未察觉的诅咒即将来临，当你看到自己所欠的债务和面临的危险有多大时，你会明白自己被拯救了。这种喜悦是永恒的，如果你觉得这一点很奇怪，那是因为你还未真正从内心深处接受这一切。只有当你从内心深处接受了福音中关于自己是一个罪人、需要得救的信息时，你才会体验到一种喜悦，这种喜悦会告诉你：“我知道我有债务，有疾病，但唯一能真正让我沉沦的债务已经被偿还了。

唯一能永远夺走生命的疾病也被治愈了。即使癌症也不能做到这一点。” 它真的不会把我打倒，因为如果我是属于他的，我就有上帝荣耀的盼望。真正的疾病已经被治愈，真正的债务已经被取消。

福音的第一个作用是向你展示你的危险有多大，但第二个作用则是让你看到耶稣所经历的痛苦有多深。在约翰福音第16章中有一个奇怪的地方，我确实认为这很奇怪，那里耶稣正试图在他即将死亡的前一晚安慰他的门徒。他试着说：“你们知道，这会很难。” 但他又说：“女人怀胎要生孩子的时候，就有疼痛；当她将要生产的时节，就有点忍耐，因为快生了。

” 于是也有你们。他在说什么？我查了一下，每次我看这段经文时，总是查阅注释以确保我没有误解。耶稣基督是把自己比作一个女人。

你必须记住的是：现在大多数女性分娩时都会有一些疼痛，但有像硬膜外麻醉这样的方法可以减轻痛苦。但在那个时代，不仅女性在生产过程中几乎无一例外地经历着难以忍受的痛苦，而且她们经常死于分娩。**这意味着，唯一的方式是通过一段充满痛苦、危险和煎熬的过程，一个女人才能生出新的生命并带来新生的喜悦。**耶稣基督说：“这就是我要去十字架时所发生的事情。

我就像那个为了带来新生而失去一切的女人。” 那么，你是如何培养这种喜乐呢？你看着说：“主耶稣，你失去了所有的喜乐，好让我能有永恒的喜乐；你经历巨大的痛苦，好让我获得新的生命。” 这就是爱的来源。

来看第五节经文：“这喜乐没有人能夺去。” 这是圣灵将上帝的爱倾倒在你心中的关键。你知道它是如何发生的吗？这是如何发生的：不要说：“哦，好的主，让我感受到你的爱。

” 我在等待。这不是实际发生的情况。它是如何发生的呢？你要看看耶稣所做的一切。

你要看着他说：“我就像那个为了带来新生而失去生命的女人。” 我喜欢那个失去了所有欢乐却带来你欢乐的女人。你看他为你做了什么。圣灵有时会用这种爱的感动给你带来欢乐。

这让你能够无论在何种境况下都能应对一切。这就是福音带给你的两种喜悦：它显示了你所面临的危险是如此巨大，以至于与已经解决的那个主要问题相比，其他所有的问题都显得微不足道；其次，你看耶稣为你做了什么。你看他付出了多少。你看他是如何失去所有的欢乐来给你带来欢乐的。

当你反复思考这些，并且每天祷告时，圣灵有时会在你心中赐下一种对上帝爱的感受，这让你能够应对一切。这就是它的运作方式。去争取吧。它就在那里。

让我们祷告：感谢你，主，赐给我们喜悦，赐给我们比现在更大的喜乐的能力。主啊，我为在座还未真正相信福音、未真正接受它、未真正凭信心认识你的人祈祷。他们还没有经历过称义。求你让他们经历，并且因此开始理解这种喜乐。

面对未来的喜乐，在苦难面前的喜乐，在你面前的喜乐。我也为所有已经相信但很大程度上依靠世俗境况带来幸福的人祷告，赐给我们这种喜乐吧，让我们扎根在喜乐中。让我们体验你的爱，好使我们能够拥有耶稣所拥有的喜乐——为了那摆在前面的喜乐，他忍受了十字架的苦难。因为你们也有了这样的喜乐，我们可以为任何事做或忍耐，因为他为我们忍受了这一切。

奉他的名祷告。阿们。感谢你收听 Tim Keller 在《福音在线播客》上的讲道。如果你希望看到更多人通过这个事工的福音中心化教导和资源受到激励，我们诚邀你考虑成为“生命中的福音”每月合作伙伴。
