# 追寻成就 / The Search for Achievement

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)

---

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Have you ever found yourself asking, what if nothing I do really last? Is this all there is?

In today's podcast, Tim Keller looks at how Ecclesiastes helps us face our doubts, fears and uncertainties, and points us to the lasting hope and significance we have in Christ. Ecclesiastes chapter 2 verses 70 to 26, and then right after that, as we have done a couple of times, a passage on the same subject, just a little further down in the book, Ecclesiastes 4, 4 to 8. So, he's a great way to start, isn't it?

So I hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.

And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.

So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he may leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. He must.

This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun? All his days he works, his work is pain and grief, and even at night his mind is not rest.

This too is meaningless. A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too I see is from the hand of God.

For without him who can eat or find enjoyment. To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind.

And I saw that all labor and all achievements spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless a chasing after the wind. The fool folds his hands and ruins himself, better one handful with tranquility, then two handfuls with toil, and chasing after the wind.

Again I saw something meaningless under the sun. There was a man all alone. He had neither son nor brother.

There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. For whom am I toiling he asked? And why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?

This too is meaningless a miserable business. This is God's word. A meaningless miserable business.

We're looking this month at Ecclesiastes. Why? Because the book of Ecclesiastes, the author, assumes a position.

He takes the position of what we were calling a practical secularist. Now, what does that mean? Well, this is what most of the people in most of the major world class cities of the world today hold, really.

This is the position of the elites, really of culture, and increasingly the general culture is in the West. And a practical secularist is someone who says this. He says, look, there may be a God, there may not be a God.

Here she says, there may not be a God, but here's the point. We don't know that God, we don't know what the will of that God is, we don't know if there is a God there for sure. And that means A, we don't know where we've come from, and B, we don't really know what happens afterwards.

As far as we know, when we die, that's it. This life is all there is. Now what many people are saying, that's the position.

If this life is all there is, if this life under the sun, which is a way Ecclesiastes writer talks about it, if this life is all there is, doesn't that make life meaningless? Well, a very famous Harvard professor, Stephen Gould, puts it this way. He says, we are here because one odd group of fishes had a peculiar anatomy that would transform into legs for terrestrial creatures.

We are here because comments struck the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs giving us mammals the chance that would otherwise not have been available. So thank you Lucky Stars in a literal sense. Now this explanation of why we are here, those superficially troubling, if not terrifying, is ultimately liberating and exhilarating.

We cannot read the meaning of life from nature. We must construct these answers ourselves. There's no other way.

Now here's what he's saying. He says life is an accident and therefore, when he says you can't read meaning in life from nature, that's a pretty euphemistic way of saying there's no meaning. There's no transcendent order.

There's no purpose. There's nothing we have to submit to. He says, well, now that might be very terrifying to think there's no meaning.

He says, but that liberates us to construct whatever meaning we want. It's liberating, it's exhilarating. We decide what the meaning of our lives are.

Now the Ecclesiastes writer, his job is to, even though he never met Stephen Gould, one of the reasons why the Ecclesiastes writer, this book will still be around 1,000 years from now if the world is still here and nobody by them will have even heard of Stephen Gould. The reason that this book is so powerful is he looks at that kind of statement and he says, that's just spin. Just spin.

Ecclesiastes writer says, I have tried it in three great ways. We're looking at one each week in three great ways. I have sought to construct meaning in life and he's done it and we've seen the other two.

Can I quickly summarize what they are? I mean, the one way you can construct your own meaning in life is become a cause-based person. Live for a cause.

Fight injustice. Fight evil. Fight something that's wrong with the world.

Be a cause-based person and he tried that. And what does he say? Well, he says, if this life under the sun is all there is, if Stephen Gould's right, then justice is just a fiction.

There are no moral absolutes and since there are no moral absolutes, why should my feeling that any particular action is wrong, Trump, the feeling of the perpetrator that it's okay? See? And so if this life is all there is, justice is a fiction, absolutely a fiction.

And the second person is no basis for ever talking about justice, but he said, we can't not believe in injustice. And therefore we do go on fighting it. And that means to be a person who's constructively meaning out of being, you know, fighting for a cause, means every single day, secular persons have got to engage in a violent disconnect between what they actually say they believe about the world and what they actually do when they see injustice and evil.

There's no basis in their view. They can't not know that it's there. And so they had this violent disconnect.

And so you see, if this life is all there is, you can't live for justice. And secondly, he tried another way of constructing his own meaning. In the second way, if you're not going to live a cause-based life, you know, against injustice, you lead a pleasure-based life and you seek pleasure and beauty.

But last week we saw the Ecclesiastes writer showed us, if this life is all there is, any perception of beauty is nothing but chemicals. There's no such thing as beauty. It's just chemistry in my brain.

I may feel there's a difference between love and just sex, but there's no difference. I may feel there's a difference between beauty and deformity, but there's no difference. And yet, not a single one of us, though a secular person has no basis for belief in beauty.

Not a single one of us can really deny that we know it's there. We can't not know there's beauty. We can't not seek it.

We have a passion for it. And therefore, the secular person lives in a violent disconnect between what they, he or she, actually says they believe about the world and what they actually do every time they listen to music and every time they kiss their loved one. Now, that's not the only thing you can do.

You see, the Ecclesiastes writer saying, I'm done this. I have been trying to construct my own meaning. And it's not liberating.

He says it's meaningless. He says it's burdensome. He says it's crushing.

Now, he's not done. There's one more. If there's no meaning in life that you can have to submit to, there's no God.

There's no transcendent order. They have to submit to. And if there is, therefore, you're free to construct your own meaningful life.

He says, I tried one to cause based life. I've tried the second one, the pleasure, beauty, based life, but there's one more thing to do. Work, achievement.

You see, success, accomplishment. And as he decides to do that, we see in the book. When he decides, I'm going to let work be the meaning of my life.

I'm going to create a work-based life. I'm going to make work in my career, the organizing principle of my life. He finds three things.

Okay? First of all, he finds that a life of work is not worth it. Then secondly, he tells us why it's not worth it and then he tells us what is worth it.

It works not worth it, why it's not worth it, and what is. Now, the first thing he tells us is that work, a life built on work, a life organized in the basis of work. I'm going to keep coming back to what I mean by that, is not worth it.

Well, why not? He tells us this basically, well, let's look at the at the what-up and then later the why. In chapter 2, the very beginning, he says in verse 18, his summary statement, I hated all the things I toiled for into the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.

Well, we'll look at that in a second, but I hated everything I did under the sun. Earlier in the chapter, this is what he says, I undertook great projects, I built houses, I made gardens and parks, I made reservoirs to watered rows, I am masked silver and gold for myself. So he's made it.

You know, one of the things that's kind of cruel about the calls of the Stephen J. Gools of the world, create your own meaningful life, is very, very few of us have actually got the furniture and the ability to do it. This guy was smart enough to be highly effective at a cause-based life, working for the cause.

And secondly, he had the money to be highly effective at a pleasure-based life. I mean, now he's got the talent and the ambition to be highly, highly effective at a work-based life. And most of us just don't have that.

But he did. And so he went all the way down each one of those roads. And what happened?

When he says, I hated everything I told for under the sun, what he's really showing us, especially in the rest of this paragraph, he's showing us that success fails on its own terms. Success fails on its own terms. What do I mean by that?

Success fails on its own terms. I'm not trying to say, as a model person, look at all these bad things the person is doing to be successful. That's wrong.

We'll see that's base. That's judging one life and its foundation on the basis of somebody else's foundation. Now let's be fair.

Let's go and take a look at what success itself claims. And on the basis of its own terms, success fails, he showed us. Well, what are the terms of success?

Why are you working? I mean, why go through all the heck and the hell and the pain of work? And the answer is we expect success to pay off in three ways.

We expect work to bring a satisfaction to bring a satisfaction to give us recognition and to make a contribution. Those three things, and what he shows us basically, and this is very powerful, very powerful, and there's no place problem where this is going to ring more true than New York City. He says, they fail on all three counts.

You can use them as tests. Does work give satisfaction? Does work bring recognition?

Does work actually make a contribution? Leave a legacy. And the answer is no.

So let's take a look. Real quick. These are three ways in which work fails.

It's not worth it. It's not worth it because it doesn't bring those three things. First of all, he says, what about the satisfaction?

Let's look inside. Most all the books, and I read a pile of books on work, and all the books, common sense books, not Christian books, not non-Christian books, just books, all out there. And one of the things I say is you're not successful, unless inside, there's a sense that you're doing what your passions are.

You're doing what you're fit to do, that inside there's a satisfaction, that it fits you. Okay, let's see when he looks inside. Well, he sees verse 22, a pretty poignant verse.

He says, what does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun, verse 23, all his days work is pain and grief, and even at night his mind is not rest, and there's three things that work brings on the inside. First of all, pain. Pain by this, he means the sheer hurt of continual exertion, of pounding your strength down.

Work just wears you down, and that's when everything's going well. Somebody recently did a major survey, and asked just tons of people, and you probably know the answer to this, if you had a 25th hour in the day, if somebody could suddenly give you one more hour for every day, what would you do with it? And what did they all say?

What did 85% say? Sleep. See?

Pain, work wears you down, work pounds you down, work drains your strength, and that's when things are going well. And the second thing you have is grief. Why?

Because you cannot work without disappointment. In a work-based life, you're always being evaluated. In a cause-based life, and certainly in a pleasure-based life, you don't have this constant evaluation, but you have to come to grief.

There has to be failure, there has to be disappointment. Markets eventually do go down, and nobody, nobody, nobody gets picked on even most of their auditions. I mean, work is rejection after rejection after rejection.

So pain if things are going well, grief if things are not going well, and then of course that's just during the daytime. At night, you worry what will tomorrow bring? Will it be in grief or will just bring pain?

What's going on? See, what's there to worry about? Either way, it's bad.

You should just stop worrying. There's only two things that can happen, and both of them are terrible, so why are you worrying? Now, you see, careful, what are you saying is, under the sun, to some degree, every kind of work will involve these things, the pain, the grief, the worry, but the more, here's what he's saying, the more you build your life on work, the more you build your life on career, the more you build your life on success.

The more you're going to experience this kind of brokenness, and that's just on the inside. So the first thing we say should work be satisfying, and he says there is some satisfaction of work, but the internal brutalizing, the brutality of work just comes in and just knocks you out, studs turquoise, years ago, 1972, wrote a very famous book, and it was called Working Subtitle. People talk about what they do all day and how they feel about what they do.

Now, usually a 1972 book on any subject you say was stated, except everybody agrees that 1972 work was a lot easier, that it wasn't as brutal, it wasn't as stressed, right, everybody agrees, and this is what he said in his opening paragraph after talking to hundreds of people in 1972. He's what he said. Does it sound like Ecclesiastes?

This book, Being About Work, is by its very nature, therefore, about violence. Violence to the spirit as well as to the body, it's about ulcers as well as accidents, it's about nervous breakdowns as well as kicking the dog around. It is above all, about daily humiliations.

To survive the day is triumph enough for the willing walking wounded among the great many of us. What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun? All his days are pain and grief and at night, he can't sleep.

Now, that's the first. It doesn't bring satisfaction. Instead, it brutalizes.

Secondly, it does not bring recognition. Now, in a minute, I'm going to get back to this because of the three things that people expect work to bring them. Satisfaction, recognition, contribution.

This is the one that it most fails to do. But I'm not going to get into that immediately because I'm under the second heading. I think this is the secret for why work is so brutalizing.

But if you want to see one more way in which work fails to give what it says, what we think it's going to give us, take a look at the very bottom of the page at the very end of chapter four. And we see something that really got him. He saw it.

He's moving through life. And he says, I saw something meaningless. There was a man all alone.

He had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. For whom am I toiling?

He asked. And why am I depriving myself of enjoyment? This too is meaningless.

Now, look what we have here. Here's a man who's successful. But he's got recognition, but not the kind we really need.

You see, if satisfaction is the psychological payoff we're hoping for, recognition is actually the social payoff. Some people to some people success means money. In some fields, you don't make much money, but the one thing success always means is esteem, approval.

See, a claim, recognition. People know they respect me because I make the kind of money that I can now I can live in this neighborhood with this kind of address, or I'm the kind of person who gets my painting shown at this kind of gallery. You see, it doesn't matter.

A person who's selling their paintings and a person who's making billions on Wall Street probably do not have the same lifestyle. It doesn't matter. What's success?

Recognition. I finally got people to see who I am and who love me and who value me and who respect me and who esteem me. And that's what it's about.

But this shows, this is what this shows right here. This little picture is very frightening. Here's a man all alone.

And this always happens. Why is that man alone? Shouldn't he have respect?

Yes, he's got respect, but he's only got respect from afar. The real relationships that you really want. The relationships that really feed this human soul and the human heart have been destroyed by work.

First of all, his family is not there. Why? Probably because of neglect.

And his friends are not there. Why? Well, I can think of three good reasons.

One is he just never spent any time to maintain friendships too busy. Number two, he just became so one-dimensional and uninteresting because all I ever did was work that he really didn't attract friends. Number three, he alienated and trampled on people on the way up the ladder.

Now, if you don't recognize this, if not in yourself at least in people you know, you're not looking very hard. Work in this world promises to bring it closer to people and all it does is that isolates you, it alienates you. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother.

In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good. In his book The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, the prodigal God will help you see your relationship with Christ in a whole new way.

The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel in life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give. That's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now, here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. So instead of satisfaction is brutalizing.

Instead of recognition, there's alienation and isolating. And then lastly, and we'll be real quick on this because he does this every week, contribution. See, everybody says to really be successful, you want to leave a legacy.

To really be successful, you want to do something that counts, that makes a difference. You want to make a contribution to your field. You want to be remembered.

All we want to be remembered. I'm going to talk more about that tonight, actually. But here's what Ecclesiastes does.

You know, there's an amazing consensus about this. That work is the way that you get a hold of the world and you make your mark on it. Here's two guys.

Probably their politics weren't quite the same. One is Henry Ford. One is Karl Marx.

And Karl Marx said this, labor is the very touchstone of man's self-realization. Man labors to transform his world to put his unmark upon it to make it his, all by work. Henry Ford said, I don't think that a man can ever leave his business.

He ought to think of it by day and dream of it by night. Thinking men know that work is the salvation of the race. Physically, morally and socially, work does not just make us a living.

It gets us a life. Okay? Here's one of the things they both believe.

Work is the way you get a hold of life and you put your mark on it and you leave it different. And that's how you know you've made a contribution. And Ecclesiastes writer says, wait a minute, wait a minute.

What if this life is all there is? See, if this life is all there is, and there's no all the meaning in life, we're trying to create meaning in life, right? So we go out there to work.

But if this life is all there is, when you die, you might be one of the very rare number of people who's remembered for a hundred years. But eventually you will be utterly forgotten. What's he say there?

Why does he hate everything under the sun? Look at verse 18. Because three things.

One is, I die and I leave it all behind. Secondly, either a fuller rich man or a wise man gets it and suddenly he says, wait a minute, it doesn't even matter if it's a fuller rich man or wise man. Even if it's a wise man, the wise man will be forgotten.

In the end, look what he says. Both the wise and the foolish will be forgotten. There will be no difference.

Eventually the sun will burn up and everything will be gone. Nothing you do will make any dent. There was an epitaph on the grave of a very famous English writer who was trying to make his mark.

And the epitaph has always haunted me. You know what it says? He says, I only ploughed water.

You ploughed water. You pull your plough out. There is no sign that you are over there.

You do not make your mark on the world. The world sweeps you away. You're a wave upon the sand.

And the Ecclesiastes writer says, there is no contribution. The more you think about all of your incredible work, it just trivializes it. I mean, it's nice.

You don't even have to think a little longer and say, oh, yes, someday, the sun will go up. But in meantime, there was a man who spent his entire life writing strong exhaustive concordance in which he sat down over 100 years ago, took every word in the Bible and he put it in columns. So you could look at every place the word and was or every place the word king was.

You know what a concordance is? Whole life. How long do you think it takes today to write a concordance?

You know what you can do by computer 10 minutes, five minutes. He spent years and years and years. This is the nature of the world.

Everything you do, you're just plowing water. Now what's the Ecclesiastes writer saying? Oh gosh, it's just spin.

Work is not worth it. And the more you build your life on work in order to make a meaningful life, the more the meaninglessness of this life will break through into your life through your work. Hear that?

The more you try to make this life meaningful through work, the more you build your life on success and career, the more the meaninglessness of life will break through onto you through your work, you'll feel it. After a while, you'll say, hey, life. Now why?

What is wrong? Why is this happening? That's a very important question.

He said, okay, sure, what does that mean? Well, I want to know what it means. Why should it be that we want these things and why can't we get them?

Animals don't seem to be bothered. Why are we so broken over our work? Why are we so messed up?

And the passage tells us two things. Now we're going deeper. The first thing it tells us is there's actually on above the ground reason and there's a below the ground reason, all right?

There's an above ground and below ground reason. If you haven't experienced the brokenness of the world through your work, if it hasn't started to brutalize your life, then this might not be all that concern. You might not concern you.

Well, please store it away for a rainy day. They will come. But right now, here's what they above the ground reason is number one.

The lack of an identity. Look at chapter four. Look, go down to chapter four and look at the very first statement in verse four.

This is one of the most categorical statements that he makes anywhere. What does he say? He says, all labor and all striving comes from envy of your neighbor, all labor and all achievement.

Now, if this was a lecture on philosophy economics, you could all go home because I'm absolutely unqualified. So what am I saying this for? But I'll tell you one thing.

This is a radical biblical deconstruction of all secular understandings of economics. What is he saying? He says, what is the engine that makes people work in spite of the horrible brutalization of that you experience in work?

What gets people going? What makes economic productivity? What motivates it?

And what he's trying to say? It's always envy. And it doesn't matter what you see in capitalism, capitalism uses the engine of individuals, envying individuals and communism or socialism.

It just uses the engine of classes, envying classes, but they're basically the same. But that's not his main point. This would be the basis of a radical deconstruction of all secular understandings of economics.

But what he's really saying is this, there's something wrong in our heart. So the reason our work is unfulfilling is you may say, I'm working just to do a good job. And to some degree, you can do that.

Or you may say, I'm working to make a product that really helps people. And to some degree, you can do that. But what he's trying to say is not that that isn't to some degree possible.

But what he's trying to say is fundamentally the primary reason you're working because there's something deeply wrong with the human heart. The thing you're actually manufacturing is not a product. Your manufacturing is self.

You don't know who you are. You are trying to prove yourself. And your work is never about you.

It's never about others. And it's never about the work. It's always about you.

In your work, you're always trying to prove what. You're trying to prove that I'm somebody special. I'm somebody real.

I'm as, as to put in CS Lewis's terms. In your work, you're saying all the time, I'm as good as you. That's what you're doing.

There's this deep need to, by competing, to move up the ladder to prove to yourself something. And that's what's driving you. Absolutely.

That's the reason. He says there are other good motives in there, but at the bottom, at the bottom, there's something going on in the human heart. And the thing that's down there is an identity vacuum.

You don't know who you are. You wouldn't be trying to prove yourself. It wouldn't be such a nightmare when you lose.

You know, you say, okay, I lost money. But that's not what. It's the humiliation.

It's the law. What is going on? It's a psychological death.

It's a loss of a self. It's a loss of an identity. You are your art.

You are your money. You are your business. You are your address.

The fact that my address is 50 Sutton Placer, 10 Sound View Drive, you know, in Greenwich. That's me. That's not just an address.

This is not just a bank account. It's all about you. And that's the reason.

Well, you're never satisfied. And while you never feel quite, you can get recognized. That's the reason for the drive.

That's the reason for the brutalization. It's the reason for all of that. He says, all labor and all achievement springs from this need to go beyond your neighbor, above your neighbor, to prove that you've got a self, to prove that you're there, prove that you have a reality.

But that's just the above ground. That's just the above ground. He says, there's actually also a below ground.

Now, before I do the below ground, let me just point out, do you see why because we are trying to manufacture a self that leads to overwork? If you just do your best in a balanced life, you almost never will get the kind of recognition you want. See, if work was really about just doing your best, you would never overwork what you do.

If work was really just about helping other people, you would never overwork what you do, but you go, you break on through the healthy barrier. You push the dial into the red, or sometimes it'll eventually happen is like what's happened here, probably in this man's life, if you begin to underwork, eventually begin to say, it means nothing. Why?

Because you're not really working to do a good job, or for other people, you're simply working for recognition, and when you don't get the recognition, it tastes nothing. If people don't notice you, if people don't see what's going on, if you're not being paid for it, the fact that you're doing a good job, or you're helping somebody else means nothing, or this doesn't mean the main thing. It's this identity vacuum that drives you into the ground, and that's the above ground reason, but then there's a below ground reason, and it's fascinating.

What's the real reason? Why do I need to prove myself through my work? Why am I driven like this?

Well, look at this. Again, it's at the very, very bottom. He contrasts something in his very fascinating verse five.

He says, better a fool folds his hands and ruins himself, better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind. What's he saying? He has this fascinating picture.

First of all, you have two handfuls of work that will ruin you. For all the reasons we've said, then you have another possibility, and that is no handfuls of work. The fool folds his hands.

Why? Because he's pretty much give it up. Almost for sure what happens is you overwork, and then eventually you just lose all your desire to work because of the brutalization of work, but no handfuls of work is a different kind of ruin.

They're both ruins. So what does he suggest? What does he put out there?

Look at this. He says, better one handful with tranquility. Now, what he's actually saying here is that the picture is, in one hand, you've got a full hand of work.

That's hard work. But in the other hand, even though it's translated tranquility, literally in the Hebrew it says quietness, not just quiet. You need a handful of quietness.

He says the problem is there is a deep kind of rest, a deep kind of quietness that's so powerful that it can sweeten and calm us and it can make a fresh life, even with the other handful of work. See that? Deep.

Experts will tell you, you don't need length of sleep, you need depth of sleep, you need rapid eye movement sleep, REM sleep, and the ecclesiastes writers talking about something deep down. And he's saying there's a restlessness in you. That's the reason you have to prove yourself, and you need this deep, supernatural divine quiet.

And until you work that in, remembering the old days, the only way that you can keep salt from meat from going bad was rub salt in it, that kept it fresh. The only way you can keep work from killing you is to rub in this deep rest. Well, what is this?

This is the great, great theme of the Bible. It's in the book of Genesis. It's in Psalm 95, but probably the best place is for our purposes is Hebrews 4.

This is what Hebrews 4 says. There remains then a rest for the people of God. Anyone who enters God's rest rests from his own work.

Now, I hear this. You may not be religious today. You may not even believe in God.

The Bible says, though, let me give you, Bible gives you this analysis. You may not even believe in God, you may not even be religious, but you're working for your salvation. Deep down inside, the Bible says everybody, regardless of your beliefs, you know there's something wrong with you.

You know you're not good enough. You've been blaming your parents or you've been blaming your upbringing or you've been blaming the ethnic group you came from or you've been blaming your small town and maybe you were blaming your up your church or your synagogue or your religion. But the Bible says you're not looking deep enough.

We all feel there's something wrong with us. We all feel we're not good enough and we're all working performing. And you see some of us are just getting right into the job and even though you're not religious, you're working for your salvation and there is a rest.

What you need is a rest from your work in your work. Do you hear that? That's the tranquility.

You need a rest from your work in your work. You need a complete rest. Well, where does that come from?

Lastly, this is what this is the life he says it's worth it. Where do we get that? Number one, we're told here the life that is worth it is a gift from God.

Go back up to the top of the chapter, the middle part of me verse 24 of chapter two. A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too is from the hand of God.

Now look at that. Satisfaction and joy in your work. That handful of tranquility that will sweeten your work is not something you can earn.

You have to receive it. It's a gift. You can never get it by striving.

You'll never attain to it. It's a gift. That's the first thing.

Secondly, first of all, it's the gift of God you need. Secondly, it's the pleasure of God. Two times in this these verses right here, verse 22 to 26, the believer is someone who's spoken of in this way, the one who pleases God.

Now, unfortunately in English, I get so angry about some of these language issues. The word pleasant and the word please is so tepid. You know, if you say I went to a movie, what do you think?

What was pleasant? Well, that means it wasn't all that great. But you see, the trouble is that let's think a little bit.

The same Hebrew word, even in the same English word, the same English word for pleasant is pleasure. Pleasure. And this is saying that a believer is someone who gives God pleasure, the believer is someone who God looks at.

And you are his pleasure. You are his beauty. He looks at you and he sees a diamond.

He looks at you and he sees and a work of art. He looks at you and his own heart is filled with the light. If you knew that, that would be the quietness that would give you a rest from your work in your work.

The book of Zephaniah talks about it in some of the most visible and vivid terms. In Zephaniah, this is what it says. Sing a loud, be glad and rejoice for the Lord has taken away the punishments against you.

The Lord is with you. He is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you.

See, pleasure. He will quiet you with his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.

How could that be? That would be it, wouldn't it? If you could know that God doesn't just say, yes, yes, you're doing a good job.

If God would actually come to you and say, you give me pleasure. I delight in you. You are an absolute beauty and stand over you and essentially embrace you and delight in you and don't on you.

That would quiet you with his love. Well, how would you get that? How could that be?

The first thing it is, the gift of God. The second thing it needs is the pleasure of God. What's the third thing you need?

You need the rest of Jesus Christ because it's Jesus. It's Jesus who said in Matthew 11, 28, this is his gospel invitation. Come unto me, all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you. Come unto me. Now, there it is.

You say, well, how do we get this rest? How could I know that God loves me like that? How could I experience that?

It's very simple. First of all, Jesus Christ says, come unto me. Not come unto that.

Not do all these things. Me come to me, a person. Some years ago, somebody once said to me, you know what?

I'd be a Christian if I could have an airtight watertight argument for God. Well, you know what? Read the Bible and read Jesus Christ and read about him.

Jesus does not say, follow my teachings. He says, come to me. Read who he is.

Read what he does. Read how he works. Read how he lives.

And you will see God does not give us an airtight watertight argument. God has given us an airtight watertight person. Come to me and take my yoke upon you.

What's that mean? It means this. Jesus Christ, remember when he was so troubled in the garden the night before he died?

He said, I am troubled in soul. I am an agony even on the death. He lost his rest.

He took our sins upon himself so that when Jesus Christ, when we believe in him, God can look at us and he can sing over us and that quietness with his love. Only Jesus can give you that kind of rest. Only there.

That's the handful of rest. Now, if you believe that and you understand that, what does that do? It changes everything.

That is the handful of tranquility that you can rub into your work and it will change the way you do anything. It will change the way you do anything. You don't need to do the, right now, if you don't have the quietness knowing he sings over you with love, you're never doing anything for itself.

You're doing things to get something. Everything you're doing in your work life, you're trying to do so that you can get something. But what if you knew that you had everything already through Jesus?

Then you would begin to work just for the sheer joy. You do the thing you do for the sheer joy of doing it. You'd help people just for the sheer joy of helping them not just so that you can feel like you're a better person.

You see it all. Oh, brother, better is one handful of tranquility and a handful of work. That's the bounce life.

Some of you need to go from two handfuls of work to one handful of work. You know what that means? A bounce life, first of all, less work done, less recognition, less contribution, and yet the only contribution that will last.

The only achievement that will last forever and the only rest that will make your work satisfying. Hear these words, let's pray. Our Father, we thank You that it's possible for us to do all these things through Jesus.

We ask that You would help us see our work transformed. Father, for those of us who are with us that don't know You or are not sure they know You, or they don't know what they believe, I pray that the work, the meaninglessness they're experiencing in their work would be a thing that would actually drive them to You. And for those of us, Lord, who know You, I pray that You would help us to see that until we are quieted with Your love, we don't have the quiet necessary to work as we should.

So many of us that were Christians, Lord, we just need to success, we're cast down and we don't have it. We pray, Lord, that You would show us that this is the only real success. I lay me down in sleep and I wake for the Lord sustains me.

The Lord, my God, is a shield for me, my glory and the lifter of my head. Let this be true for all of us today. We pray in Jesus' name.

**讲员**: 提摩太·凯勒 (Tim Keller)


欢迎来到《生命中的福音》。你有没有问过自己，如果我所做的一切都不长久呢？这难道就是一切吗？今天，蒂姆·凯勒将从《传道书》中探讨如何面对我们的疑惑、恐惧和不确定性，并引导我们找到在基督里的永恒希望和意义。

我们将参考《传道书》2章70节至26节的内容，以及稍后在同一本书中的另一段相关经文，《传道书》4章4节到8节。这真是一个很好的开始，不是吗？我厌恶生命，因为我在日光之下的工作让我痛苦不堪。这一切都是徒劳的，如同追逐风一般。

我对我在日光之下所做的一切感到憎恶，因为我必须把这些留给后来的人。谁知道他会不会是个聪明人还是个愚昧人呢？然而，他会掌控我投入智慧、知识和技能的所有工作。这也毫无意义。

因此，我的心灵开始对所有辛勤劳作感到绝望，在日光之下的劳碌让我心灰意冷。因为一个人可能以智慧、知识和技巧完成他的工作，然后他可以将这一切留给没有付出努力的人。这是必然的。这也是徒劳无功，而且是极大的不幸。

人通过辛勤劳动和焦虑的努力得到了什么？他在白天辛勤劳作，工作充满痛苦和悲伤，在夜晚也无法得到安宁。这也毫无意义。一个人最好的选择就是吃喝，并在工作中找到满足感。

我看到这一切都是出于上帝之手。因为没有他，谁能吃或享受呢？上帝赐给那些讨祂喜悦的人智慧、知识和快乐，但对罪人来说，他只是让他们聚集财富，最后交给那些讨上帝喜悦的人。这也毫无意义，如同追逐风一般。

我还发现，所有人的劳碌和成就都源于对他人的嫉妒。这也是徒劳无功，如同追逐风一般。愚昧之人双手一摊，自毁前程；与其两手空空地追求，不如一手拥有并安详。我又看了一件毫无意义的事。

有个孤身一人的人，没有儿子，也没有兄弟。他辛勤劳作，却没有满足于自己的财富。他问自己：我为何要如此劳碌？为何不享受生活？

这也是一件毫无意义、令人痛苦的事情。这是上帝的话——一件毫无意义、令人痛苦的事情。我们这个月将探讨传道书。为什么呢？

因为《传道书》的作者采取了一个立场。他站在了我们所说的实用世俗主义者的立场上。**这意味着什么？实际上，这正是当今世界上大多数主要城市中大多数人所持有的观点。**

这是文化精英们的态度，而在西方，这种态度也越来越普遍。一个实用世俗主义者会这样说：或许有上帝，或许没有上帝。她可能会说：或许没有上帝，但**关键是这一点。**我们不知道那个上帝是谁，也不知道那个上帝的旨意是什么，更不清楚是否真的有上帝存在。

**这意味着，A、我们不知道自己从何而来；B、我们也不清楚之后会发生什么。**就我们所知，当我们死去时，一切就结束了。这就是这世上唯一的生活。现在许多人持有这种观点。

如果生活就是这样，如果像《传道书》作者所说的“在日光之下”，如果生活就是这样的，那生活岂不是毫无意义？哈佛大学一位著名教授斯蒂芬·古尔德这样说道：我们之所以存在，是因为一种奇特的鱼类拥有特殊的解剖结构，这最终演化成了陆地生物的腿。我们之所以存在，是因为陨石撞击地球消灭了恐龙，给了哺乳动物生存的机会，否则这些机会是不存在的。所以，从字面上讲，我们要感谢幸运之星。

这种解释尽管表面上看似令人不安甚至可怕，但实际上却是解放和振奋人心的。我们无法从自然中读出生活的意义。我们必须自己构建这些问题的答案。没有其他方法。

现在他这么说：生命是偶然的，因此他说你不能从自然中读出意义，这其实是一种委婉的说法，意思是说没有意义。没有超越的秩序。没有目的。没有什么是我们必须服从的东西。

他说，想到这一点可能会非常可怕，因为**这意味着没有意义。**但他认为这是解放性的，令人振奋的。我们决定生命的意义是什么。现在，《传道书》的作者，即使他从未见过斯蒂芬·古尔德，这本书之所以在1000年后仍然存在，如果世界还在的话，并且没有人听说过斯蒂芬·古尔德，是因为这个原因：这本书如此强大，因为它看待这种说法时说，那只是宣传。

只是宣传。《传道书》的作者说，我用三种伟大的方式尝试过构建生命的意义。我们每周都在探讨这三种方式中的一个。我能快速总结一下它们是什么吗？

一种构建生命意义的方式是成为以事业为导向的人。为某个事业而活。为正义而战。为邪恶而斗争。

为世界上某些不正确的事情而斗争。成为一个以事业为导向的人，他尝试过这种方式。他说，如果这世上的生活就是一切，如果斯蒂芬·古尔德是对的，那么正义就是一个虚构的东西。没有道德绝对标准，既然没有道德绝对标准，为什么我的感觉认为某个行为是错误的，应该凌驾于施加者觉得它没问题的感觉？

看，所以如果这世上的生活就是一切，正义是一个完全的虚构。并且第二个人也没有任何理由谈论正义，但他却说不能不相信不公。因此我们仍然要继续斗争。**这意味着作为每天为某个事业而奋斗的人，你必须在存在中具有建设性意义。**

所以每一个世俗人士每天都必须在他们所相信的世界观和面对不公正与邪恶时的实际行动之间保持一种暴力的断裂。从他们的观点来看，这没有依据。他们不可能不知道它的存在。因此，他们就有了这种暴力的断裂。

因此，如果你认为这就是一切，你便无法为正义而活。其次，他尝试了另一种构建意义的方法。第二种方法是，如果你不打算为了反对不公而生活，你就过一种以享乐为基础的生活，追求快乐和美好。但上周我们看到，传道书作者向我们展示了，如果这就是一切，那么任何对美好的感知都只不过是化学反应。

没有所谓的美，只是大脑中的化学物质在起作用。我可能会觉得爱与性之间有区别，但实际上并没有什么不同。我可能会认为美丽与畸形之间有区别，但实际上也没有什么不同。然而，没有一个世俗的人能够否认我们都知道它在那里。

我们不能否认美是存在的。我们无法不去追求它。我们对它的热情驱使着我们。因此，世俗人士在面对他们所相信的世界观和每次聆听音乐、亲吻爱人时的实际行动之间保持着一种暴力的断裂。

但这并不是唯一的选择。你看，传道书作者说，我已经尝试过构建自己的意义了，但那并不令人解放。他说那是毫无意义的。他说那是沉重的负担。

他说那是压垮人的。他还没有结束。还有一种可能。如果生活中没有你可以屈服的意义，那就没有上帝。

没有超越的秩序，他们必须服从。如果有这样的秩序存在，那么人们就可以自由地构建自己有意义的生活。他说：“我尝试过基于因果的生活，也尝试过基于快乐和美的生活，但还有一件事要做——工作与成就。” 你看，成功与成就。

当他决定这样做时，在书中我们看到了这一点。当他说他要让工作成为生活的意义时，我要在我的职业生涯中建立一个以工作为基础的生活原则。他发现了三件事情：首先，他认为一种基于工作的生命不值得；其次，他告诉我们为什么它不值得；最后，他告诉我们什么是值得的。工作不值得，为什么它不值得，以及什么值得。

现在，他告诉我们的第一件事是，一种以工作为基础的生活——即一个建立在工作基础上的生命——并不值得。那么为什么不值得呢？他基本上这样告诉我们：让我们先看看“是什么”，然后再看“为什么”。在第二章的开头，他说：“我憎恨我在日光下所做的一切劳作，因为这些劳作我要留给后来的人。

”（传道书2:18） 我们一会儿再来看这句话，但他在这一章早些时候说：“我从事了巨大的工程，建造房屋、花园和公园，修建水渠灌溉田地，并且用银子和黄金装饰自己。” 你知道，世界上的斯蒂芬·J·古尔兹（Stephen J. Gools）等人号召人们创造自己的有意义的生活，但事实上，我们中很少有人真正拥有实现这一目标的条件。这个人足够聪明，能够高效地从事基于因果的工作；其次，他有足够的财富来高效地享受生活。现在，他有才华和雄心去高效地从事基于工作的事业。

而大多数人都没有这样的条件。但他做到了，并且走遍了每一条路。那么结果如何呢？当他说他厌恶太阳底下的一切，他真正想告诉我们的是，在接下来的这一段里，他向我们展示了成功在它自己的标准下是失败的。

成功在它自己的标准下是失败的。我是什么意思？成功在它自己的标准下是失败的。我不是要你们看一个成功的人做了多少坏事。

那不对。我们要看到这是基于错误的基础。现在让我们公平一些。让我们看看成功的定义本身。

根据它的标准，成功是失败的。他向我们展示了这一点。那么，成功的标准是什么呢？你为什么工作？

我指的是，为什么要经历工作的艰辛和痛苦呢？答案是我们期望工作能带来三方面的满足感：成就感、认可度以及贡献。这三个方面，他向我们展示的基本情况就是，这非常有力，非常有力，而这个问题在纽约市尤其会得到验证。他说，这些方面都失败了。

你可以用它们作为测试标准。工作是否带来了满足感？工作是否带来了认可？工作实际上是否做出了贡献？

留下了遗产？答案是不。让我们快速看一下。这三个方面的工作失败之处： 它不值得去做，因为它没有带来那些三方面的满足感。

首先，他说，关于满足感呢？我们来看看内心吧。我读了很多关于工作的书，所有这些书都不是基督教书籍或非基督教书籍，只是普通的书籍。其中一点是，除非你内心有一种感觉，认为你在做自己热爱的事情，适合做的事情，否则你并不成功。

好的，让我们看看他如何从内心来看待这个问题。他在第22节看到了一个非常感人的句子。他这样说，人劳碌得来的，到底有福吗？太阳底下所作的事都是虚空，徒劳无功。

工作带来的三种内在影响：首先，痛苦。这里的痛苦是指持续努力的纯粹折磨，是不断耗尽体力的感受。工作会把你累垮，即使一切顺利也是如此。最近的一项大规模调查中，问了很多人一个问题：如果你突然多出一个小时每天，你会怎么利用它？

他们怎么说？85%的人回答说：睡觉。看吧？工作带来的痛苦会让你疲惫不堪，即使事情进展顺利也是如此；其次，悲伤。

为什么呢？因为无法避免失望。在以工作的基础上生活时，你总是被评估；而在以事业或享乐为基础的生活里，并不会有这种持续的评估，但你会经历悲伤。必须有失败，必须有失望。

市场最终会下跌，没有人能在大多数试镜中都脱颖而出。工作就是一次又一次的拒绝。所以，当事情顺利时是痛苦，不顺利时是悲伤；而到了晚上，你又在担心明天会带来什么？是悲伤还是痛苦？

发生了什么事？看吧，有什么好担心的呢？无论怎样，结果都是糟糕的。你应该停止担忧。

只有两种可能的结果，而且两者都糟糕透顶，为什么还要担忧呢？现在你看，小心，你在说什么呢？在太阳底下，某种程度上，所有类型的工作都会带来这些：痛苦、悲伤和忧虑；但更重要的是，他说，你越是把生活建立在工作之上，越是把生活寄托于事业成功，你就越容易陷入这种困境。> 你越是会经历这种破碎感，而且只是在内心。

所以，我们首先要说工作的满足感应该是存在的，他说工作确实有其满足之处，但内心的残暴、工作的残酷性却接踵而至。史蒂文斯·托克维尔多年前，在1972年写了一本非常著名的书，书名叫《工作》。人们谈论他们一天的工作以及对这份工作的感受。通常来说，一本关于任何主题的1972年的书籍都被认为是过时了，但大家都同意1972年的工作要容易得多，没有那么残酷，压力也没有那么大，对吧？

而这正是他在1972年与数百人交谈后所发现的。他说的是什么？这听起来像《传道书》吗？这本书《关于工作的存在》，从本质上来说，是关于暴力的。

这种暴力不仅体现在精神上，也体现在身体上；它关乎溃疡和事故，关乎神经衰弱和对狗的虐待。最重要的是，它关乎日常的屈辱。能够熬过一天就是胜利，对于我们中的大多数“受伤者”来说，这已经足够了。人为什么要在烈日下辛勤劳作，焦虑地追求？

他的日子充满了痛苦和悲伤，在夜晚也无法入睡。这就是第一点：它不带来满足感，反而带来残暴。其次，它也不带来认可。现在，我要回到这一点，因为人们期望工作能给他们带来的三件事是：满足感、认可和贡献。

这是它最失败的一点。但我不马上深入讨论这个原因，因为我正在第二部分的标题下。我认为这就是为什么工作的残酷性如此之大的秘密所在。如果你想再看一个工作未能给予我们所期待的东西的方式，在第4章的最后一段底部，你会发现让他深受触动的东西。

他看到了一些毫无意义的事物：有一个男人独自一人。他既无子嗣也无兄弟，辛勤劳作却不知满足于自己的财富。他问自己：我到底为了谁而劳碌？又为何要自我剥夺享受的权利呢？

这都是毫无意义的。现在，请看这个人。他是成功的，但这种成功并非我们真正需要的那种。你看，如果满足感是我们所期望的心理回报，那么认可就是社会层面的回报。

对某些人来说，成功意味着财富；而在一些领域里，你可能赚不到很多钱，但成功总是意味着获得尊重、认可。一个声明，一种认可：人们知道我之所以受到尊敬，是因为我能挣到足以让我住在这样一个社区的钱，或者我是那种能在某个画廊展示自己作品的人。这并不重要。卖画的人和在华尔街赚取数十亿的人可能生活方式完全不同，但这并不重要。

什么是成功？认可。终于有人开始看到**真正的自我，并且爱我、尊重我、珍视我。这才是**成功的真谛。

但这里也显示了这一点：这张小图非常可怕。一个孤独的男人。这种情况总是会发生。为什么他会独自一人？

难道他不应得到尊重吗？是的，他得到了尊重，但这只是来自远方的认可。真正想要的人际关系——那些滋养人类灵魂和心灵的真实联系——已经被工作摧毁了。首先，他的家庭不在身边。

为什么？可能是因为疏忽。其次，他的朋友也不在身边。为什么呢？

我可以想到三个原因。一是因为他从未花时间去维护友谊，太忙了；二是他变得单一且乏味，因为所有他做的事情就是工作，所以他没有吸引到朋友；三是他在爬上阶梯的过程中得罪和践踏了许多人。现在，如果你没有意识到这一点——无论是你自己还是你认识的人身上——你就没有认真去寻找。这个世界的工作看似会将它带给你，但它只会让你更加孤立，让你与世隔绝。

你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是一个放荡的弟弟。实际上，耶稣讲这个故事是想对那些远离上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得祂爱的人说些什么。在《浪子的神》一书中，提摩太·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心——一个既是对叛逆弟弟也是对苛责哥哥的好消息，同时也向所有人发出邀请，让他们体验上帝那慷慨、无尽的恩典。无论你是基督徒还是仍在探索信仰，浪子的神都会帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。

浪子的神是我们感谢你们本月捐赠给福音生活的礼物，借此机会分享耶稣仁慈和不懈之爱的希望和喜乐给全世界的人们。现在就访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取你的副本。接下来是凯勒博士今天的其余讲道内容。因此，满足感是残酷的。

相反，承认会带来隔阂与孤立。最后一点，我们很快就会谈到，因为他在每周都会这样做——贡献。你看，每个人都说要想真正成功，你必须留下遗产。要想真正成功，你必须做一些有意义的事情，做出改变，为你的领域做出贡献，被记住。

我们也都想被记住。今晚我会更多地讨论这一点。但这里就是《传道书》的观点。你知道的，关于这一点有一个惊人的共识：工作是掌握世界、在其中留下印记的方式。

这里有两个人： 他们可能政治观点不太相同。一个是亨利·福特。另一个是卡尔·马克思。卡尔·马克思曾说过：“劳动是人自我实现的试金石。

人通过劳动改造世界，赋予它自己的印记，使它成为自己的。”亨利·福特也说：“我认为一个人不能离开他的事业。” 他应该白天想着它，晚上梦着它。思考的人知道，工作是种族拯救之道。

从身体、道德和社会的角度来看，工作不仅让我们有生计。它让我们拥有一生。好吧，他们俩都相信这一点： 工作是你抓住生活并留下印记的方式，使世界变得不同。这样你才知道自己做出了贡献。

而传道书的作者说：“等等，等等。” 如果这就是一切呢？你看，如果这就是一切，生命中没有更多的意义，我们试图在生命中创造意义，对吧？所以我们去工作。

但如果这就是一切，当你去世时，你可能成为极少数被记住一百年的人之一。但最终你会完全被人遗忘。他说的是什么？他为什么恨世上的万事万物呢？

看看第18节。因为他有三个理由： 一是我死了，把一切都留给了别人。其次，无论是富人还是智者得到了这一切，突然之间，他意识到即使是最富有的或最聪明的人也无所谓。即使是智者也会被遗忘。

最终，看他说的话：无论智者还是愚者都会被遗忘，没有区别。最终太阳会燃烧殆尽，一切都会消失。你所做的任何事情都不会留下痕迹。有一位非常著名的英国作家的墓碑上刻着这样的话，一直困扰着我。

你知道它说了什么吗？他说：“我只是犁了水。” “你也犁了水。” “你把犁拉出来。

” “在那里没有你的痕迹。” “你没有在世界上留下印记。” “世界会把你带走。” “你只是沙滩上的波浪。

” 传道书的作者说，没有什么贡献。你越想你的所有伟大工作，它就越显得微不足道。我说的是，这很好，但也很微不足道。你甚至不需要多想一下，就说：“是的，将来太阳会升起。

”但在这期间，有一个人耗尽了他的一生来编写一本详尽的词典，在一百多年前他就坐下来，把圣经里的每一个单词都列在了表格里。这样你就可以查看每个“和”字出现的地方，或者每个“王”字出现的地方。你知道什么是词典吗？一生的时间。

你觉得今天写一个词典需要多长时间？用电脑只需要10分钟或5分钟就能完成。他却花费了数年时间。这就是世界的本性。

你所做的每一件事都像是在耕水。那么，传道书的作者在说什么呢？天啊，这不过是徒劳无功罢了。工作没有意义。

而当你试图通过工作来构建有意义的生活时，生活的无意义就会通过你的工作渗透到你的生活中。听到了吗？你越是试图通过工作让生活变得有意义，越是把生活建立在成功和事业之上，生活的无意义就越会通过你的工作渗透到你身上，你会感受到这一点。过了一段时间后，你会问：“嘿，生活。

为什么呢？” 出了什么问题？为什么会发生这种情况？这是一个非常重要的问题。

他说：“好吧，那是什么意思？”我想知道它的含义。“为什么我们要想要这些东西却得不到它们？” 动物似乎并不在意。

我们为什么会在工作中如此困扰？我们为什么如此混乱？这段经文告诉我们两件事。我们现在更深入了。

第一件事是，实际上有地上和地下的原因。如果你没有通过工作体验到世界的破碎性，如果它还没有开始残酷地影响你的生活，那么这可能对你来说并不是什么大问题。请把它存起来，以备不时之需。它们会来的。

但目前，这里就是地上层的原因：第一点是缺乏身份感。看看第四章。看，去第四章，看一下第四节的第一句话。这是他最明确的陈述之一。

他说什么？他说：“一切劳作和努力都源于嫉妒你的邻居，一切劳作和成就都是如此。” 如果这是一堂哲学经济学讲座，你们都可以回家了，因为我完全不合格。那么我这样说有什么意义呢？

但我会告诉你一件事。这实际上是圣经对所有世俗经济理解的激进解构。他到底在说什么？他说的是：是什么驱使人们即使面对工作中可怕的残酷剥削也要继续劳作？

是什么让人们充满动力？是什么推动着经济生产力的发展？他想说的是，这一切的动力都是嫉妒。无论你看到资本主义中的什么，无论是资本主义利用个人之间的嫉妒，还是社会主义或共产主义利用阶级间的嫉妒，它们本质上是一样的。

但这并不是他的主要观点。这会成为对所有世俗经济理解的激进解构的基础。但他真正要说的是：我们内心出了问题。所以，你说工作没有意义的原因可能是你认为你在努力做好工作。

在某种程度上，这是可能的。或者你认为你在制造的产品真的能帮助人们，在某种程度上这也是可能的。但他说的并不是说这些不可能实现。他想说的是，根本原因在于人类内心的深处存在问题。

你所制造的东西并非产品，而是你自己。你不知道自己是谁，你试图证明自己的价值。你的工作从来不是关于你本人，也不是关于他人或工作的本身。它总是关乎你自身。

在工作中，你总是在试图证明什么。你在不断告诉自己：我是特别的人，是真实的存在。用C.S.刘易斯的话来说，你在工作中一遍遍地说：我跟你一样好。这就是你在做的事情。

竞争背后有一种深刻的需要，通过攀爬阶梯来证明自己。这就是你的动力所在。绝对如此。原因就是这个。

他说在那里还有其他良好的动机，但最根本的，在人的内心深处，有一个空虚感。你不知道你是谁。如果你不试图证明自己，失败就不会那么可怕。你知道，你说，好吧，我丢了钱。

但这不是重点。是羞辱。这是法律问题。发生了什么？

这是一种心理上的死亡。这是一个自我丧失的过程。这是一个身份认同的缺失。你就是你的艺术。

你就是你的金钱。你就是你的事业。你就是你的住址。我的住址是50 Sutton Placer, 10 Sound View Drive，在格林威治。

这代表的就是我，而不仅仅是地址。这不是一个简单的银行账户问题。这关乎你自己。这就是原因所在。

你永远都不满意。因为你总觉得自己没有得到足够的认可。这就是驱使你不断努力的原因。这也是为什么会有这种残酷行为的原因。

这一切都是因为这个需要超越邻居、证明自己存在的需求。但这些都是表面的东西，他说，实际上还有更深层次的问题。在深入探讨之前，请注意，你们是否看到了我们试图制造一个自我形象而导致过度工作的原因？如果你在一个平衡的生活里尽你最大的努力，几乎不会得到你想获得的认可。

如果工作真的只是关于做好自己的话，你就永远不会因为工作而过度劳累。但如果工作是为了帮助别人的话，你也永远不会因为工作而过度劳累，但你会突破健康的界限，把仪表推到红色区域，或者最终像这里发生的情况一样，在这个人的一生中，如果你开始不那么努力工作，最终会说这没什么意义。为什么呢？因为你不是真的为了做好工作，或者为了别人，你只是单纯地为了获得认可而工作。

当得不到认可时，这一切就变得毫无意义。如果没有人注意到你，没有人看到你在做什么，如果没有报酬，你做得再好、帮助了别人再多也毫无意义，或不意味着最重要的东西。正是这种身份上的空虚让你陷入困境，这就是表面的原因。但还有更深层的原因，这非常有趣。

**真正的原因是**什么？我为什么需要通过工作来证明自己？为什么会这样驱动我？看看这个。

再次强调，在他的非常有趣的第五节中，他对比了两种情况。他说：“愚昧人用手托住自己的头，强如作工的手拿空筐。” 这里他在说什么呢？他描绘了一个非常有趣的情景。

首先，你有满满一双手的劳作，这会让你身心俱疲。然后还有另一种选择，那就是什么也不做。愚昧的人把手放在胸前。为什么？

因为他已经放弃了。几乎可以肯定的是，你会过度劳累，最终会失去所有工作的欲望，因为工作把你折磨得体无完肤。但什么都不做的那种状态也是一种毁灭。两者都是毁灭。

那么他建议什么呢？他提出了什么？看看这个。他说：“愚昧人用手托住自己的头。

” 这里实际上的意思是，在一只手拿着满满的工作的同时，另一只手需要一些安静。他说的问题在于，有一种深刻的安宁、一种强大的平静感，它能够使我们的心灵得到滋养和安抚，并能为另一只手中的工作带来新生。看到没有？深刻。

专家会告诉你，你不需要睡眠的时长，你需要的是深度睡眠，特别是快速眼动期的睡眠（REM sleep），而以斯帖书中的作者也在谈论一些深层次的东西。他说你们内心有一种不安。这就是为什么你们需要证明自己的原因，你们需要这种深层、超自然的神圣宁静。直到你们将这一点融入生活，记得过去的时光——唯一防止肉变质的方法是撒盐让它保持新鲜；同样地，唯一能防止工作压垮你的是要让心灵得到深层次的休息。

那么，这到底是什么呢？这就是圣经中的伟大主题之一。它在创世记中有所体现，在诗篇95篇也有提及，但对我们来说最好的地方可能是希伯来书4章。希伯来书4章这样说：因此，上帝的子民还有一份安息等着他们。

凡进入上帝安息的人就停止了自己的劳碌。现在，我听到这些话了。你今天可能不信仰宗教，甚至可能不相信有神。但圣经说，让我给你分析一下。

即使你不相信有神，也不一定非得是宗教信徒，你们实际上都在为自己的救赎而努力工作。圣经说，不管你的信仰如何，每个人内心深处都知道自己有问题。你知道自己不够好，你可能把责任归咎于父母、成长环境、种族背景、小城镇、甚至教会或犹太会堂或宗教。但圣经说，你没有深入地去思考这个问题。

我们都觉得我们有某种问题，都觉得不够好，并且都在努力工作。你们中的一些人甚至在工作中找到了满足感，即使你不信仰宗教，你们也在为自己的救赎而努力工作，所以需要一份安息。你需要的是一份来自工作的宁静休息。你听到了吗？

这就是平静。你需要从你的工作中得到休息。你需要完全的休息。那么，这一切从何而来呢？

最后，他说生活是值得的。我们从哪里获得这一点呢？首先，圣经告诉我们，值得的生活是上帝赐予的礼物。回到第二章第24节的中间部分。

人所能做的最好事情，莫过于吃喝，并在他劳碌中得享所作的事。这也是出于神的手。现在看看这个。在工作中找到满足和快乐。

那种平和的感觉会甜化你的工作，这不是你能赚来的。你必须接受它，这是礼物。你永远无法通过努力得到它。它就是一份礼物。

首先，你需要的是上帝的恩赐。其次，这还是上帝的喜悦。在这几节经文中，从第22节到26节，信徒被描述为让神感到喜悦的人。现在，不幸的是，在英语中，我对于这些语言问题非常生气。

“pleasant” 和 “please” 这两个词太平淡了。比如，你说你去看了一场电影，你觉得它怎么样？觉得愉快吗？那意味着它并不是特别好。

但想想看，同一个希伯来词，甚至同一个英文词“pleasant”，实际上就是“pleasure”。这里说信徒是让神感到喜悦的人，是神看着你就如同看到钻石、艺术品一样。他看着你，心中充满了光明。如果你知道这一点，那种平和感就会让你在工作中得到安宁。

《西番雅书》用最直接生动的语言描述了这一点。在《西番雅书》，它这样说：大声歌唱，欢喜快乐，因为耶和华除掉你的刑罚；耶和华与你同在；他必大大救赎你。看，喜悦。他会因他的爱使你安静下来。

他会为你欢呼跳跃。这怎么可能呢？如果知道这一点，那不就是你在工作中得到的安宁吗？《西番雅书》用最直接生动的语言描述了这一点。

在《西番雅书》，它这样说：大声歌唱，欢喜快乐，因为耶和华除掉你的刑罚；耶和华与你同在；他必大大救赎你。看，喜悦。他会因他的爱使你安静下来。他会为你欢呼跳跃。

如果上帝真的来到你面前，对你说：“我因你而喜悦。我在你身上找到极大的快乐。你是绝对的美丽，我将拥抱你，享受你。”这会用他的爱使你安静下来。

那么，你怎么得到这一切呢？又如何实现呢？首先，这是上帝的恩赐。其次，你需要上帝的喜悦。

第三样你需要的是什么呢？你需要耶稣基督的全部，因为这就是耶稣。他在马太福音11章28节中说出了他的福音邀请：“凡劳苦担重担的人，可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。” 你们要拿我的轭套在自己颈项上，学我的样式，这样，你们心里就必得享平安。

现在，这就是了。你说，那我们怎么得到这种安息呢？我又怎么能体验到上帝对我的爱？其实很简单。

首先，耶稣基督说：“到我这里来。”不是“到那里去”，也不是“去做那些事”。而是“到我这里来”，一个活生生的人。几年前，有人对我说过这样的话： 如果我能有一个无懈可击的论证来证明上帝的存在，我就成了基督徒。

但你知道吗？读一读圣经，了解耶稣基督。耶稣没有说：“跟随我的教导。”他只是说：“到我这里来。

”去认识他是谁吧。看看他的所作所为。看看他是如何工作的。看看他是如何生活的。

你会发现，上帝并没有给我们一个无懈可击的论证。上帝给了我们一个无懈可击的人——耶稣基督。到我这里来，拿我的轭套在自己颈项上。那是什么意思呢？

**这意味着：当耶稣基督在受难之夜如此困扰时，他说：“我在灵里是忧愁，甚至到了极点。**”他失去了安息。他承担了我们的罪，这样当我们相信耶稣的时候，上帝就可以看着我们，并且为着我们歌唱，用他的爱使我们安静下来。只有耶稣才能给你这种安息。

这就是那一点点的安息。现在，如果你相信这一点并理解它，会怎样呢？这将改变一切。那便是你可以在工作中揉进的一小撮宁静，它会改变你做事的方式。

它会改变你做事的方式。你现在不需要做那些事，如果你没有那份安静，知道祂用爱为你歌唱的话，你就永远不会为任何事情而做。你所做的每一件事都是为了得到什么。你在工作生活中所做的一切，都是为了能够获得一些东西。

但如果你知道你已经通过耶稣拥有一切呢？那么，你会开始只是为了纯粹的乐趣而工作。你做事是因为纯粹的喜悦，而不是为了其他目的。你会帮助别人只是因为你从帮助他们中感到快乐，并不是为了让自己感觉更好。

你看透了一切。哦，兄弟，更好的是，一撮宁静加一小撮工作的收获。这就是生活的弹跳力。你们中有部分人需要从两小撮工作减少到一小撮工作。

你知道**这意味着什么吗？生活中的弹跳，首先少做些工作，少一些认可，少一些贡献，但却只有这种贡献能持久。**唯一能长久的成就，唯一能让工作变得有意义的休息。听这些话，让我们祷告。

我们的父啊，我们感谢祢，通过耶稣，这一切对我们都是可能的。求祢帮助我们在工作中看到转变。父啊，对于我们中那些还不认识祢或不确定自己是否认识祢的人，或者不知道自己相信什么的人来说，我希望他们工作中的无意义感会驱使他们来到祢面前。对于那些已经认识祢的我们，主啊，我祷告求祢帮助我们明白，在没有祢的爱让我们安静之前，我们无法以正确的方式工作。

我们中许多基督徒，主啊，**我们需要成功，但我们却沮丧而失败了。**求祢让我们看到这是唯一**真正的成功。我把头枕在祢的怀抱里入睡，在祢的扶持下醒来。我的神，我的上帝，是**为我遮蔽的盾牌，是我的荣耀和高举我头的人。

愿这真理今天成为我们每个人的现实。我们在耶稣的名中祷告。```markdown 阿门。感谢收听蒂姆·凯勒和《福音与生活播客》。
