## 耶稣与我们同哭 / Jesus Weeps with Us

He's not saying, oh, I'm going to raise him from the dead. He's weeping with those who weep. We're told he's angry at the tomb.

He's bellows and anger when he comes to the tomb. You know, Jesus, the tomb in John 11 almost forces you. The view of Jesus there almost forces you to think of Dylan Thomas, the great Welsh poets, line, famous line.

He says, do not go silent into that night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And that's what Jesus is doing there.

He's raging against the dying. He's death which separates soul from body. Injustice, the separates race from race or person from person.

All things that God has joined together, all things that put things a sunder, that God has brought together, are bad, they're bad. They're evil in themselves. They're not just, oh, they have a silver lining or if you just look at them in another way, they're not really bad.

They're bad. It's terrible. Jesus hates them.

He's weeping. He's angry at them. But Romans 8.28 says the way God defeats those really, truly bad things is some total altogether.

God is overruling, shaping, mastering everything. So in the end, he defeats bad because somehow he's going to make all the bad and everything working together to bring about good results in your life. And the question you might say is how?

And of course, I think there's one way in which God does this, which is relatively easy to grasp. And there's another way in which God does this, which is impossible to understand. The one way that's fairly easy to grasp is actually right here.

Verse 28 says he works all things for good. In verse 29 he says that his whole plan for us is to conform us to the likeness of his son. Now that's the part that we can grasp and that's this.

You may think your biggest problem are your circumstances. You may think my biggest problem is if I could just make the money, if I could just get the job, if this door would open, you think your problems are the circumstances. But circumstances cannot destroy your life.

The way character flaws can. It's your character that is your real problem. That's what will destroy you really.

It's foolishness and pride and selfishness and denial about your sins and your flaws. And hardness of heart, and most of all, the false delusion that you really can make, you can handle life without God. All those mistakes, those flaws and character, those are the things, which almost always, it takes bad stuff to knock out of us.

Almost all of us that have been alive more than two or three decades, no offense to anybody. Those of us who have been alive two or three decades or more than two or three decades, there are things that have happened to us and we have scars and they're bad and they still hurt, and yet the insight or the character or the strength that we've gotten from it, we wouldn't trade for anything. And that's just a hint of what we're being told here.

All kinds of bad things are going to happen to you through which God is going to conform you to the likeness of His Son. And there's no joy without that conformity. So you say, okay, is that exhausted?

Is that it? I mean, all the bad things are just going to make me a better person? No, it can't because there's another sense of which God is obviously working all things together for good that will always escape us.

And you have to know it if you're going to be able to handle the troubles of life. You have to know God is working all things together for good and you couldn't possibly grasp how. To me, still, the primary, premier place where you can see this.

And I'll speak for myself. I won't confess your sins, I'll confess mine. If I was at the foot of the cross, that dark afternoon, like a lot of people.

And I knew what everybody else knew and only what everybody else knew. He was a really good man. He was a powerful man.

Here's a man who had tremendous power to do good. He was healing people. He was feeding people.

He had enormous potential. And yet he's cut off in the middle of his life, 33 years old, tragic death. And it's clear that God had abandoned him.

In fact, he says God has forsaken him. So with all the facts that everybody else had, if I was there, I would have looked up and I would have said, I don't see what good God could possibly be bringing out of this. And I would have gone home losing my faith perhaps, at least shaken, maybe losing it.

Because I couldn't fit how God was bringing enormous good. That was the greatest thing that God had ever would ever do for the human race. Because it didn't fit into my little brain patterns and my little categories.

I would have said, I don't see what God could possibly be doing. In other words, if you've got an infinite God, of course you could have reasons for why he's allowing something that you can't consider. That you can't understand.

It's the height of arrogance not to think about that. So if that's what I would have done at the foot of the cross, and my guess is that's probably what you would have done at the foot of the cross, when you feel abandoned, when everything seems like it's happening to you, you can't see any good reason why in the world it would happen, don't you dare make the same mistake. Don't make the same mistake.

Our bad things will turn out for good. That's one very important thing to grasp, and Christmas shows us that. Secondly though, our most truly good things can never be taken away from us.

Now that's the second thing Christmas shows us. Why? Well, if anything, Christmas shows us the radical graciousness of God's salvation.

The trajectory of human religion is I code God. I have to ascend through moral effort and through transformations of consciousness or whatever. I must ascend toward God.

耶稣诞生在贫穷中。他出生在一个危险的环境中。你知道，他的家人不得不逃到埃及以躲避屠杀。没有地方可以让他住。

但正是从耶稣的贫穷中，带来了最伟大的精神财富；从耶稣的软弱中，带来了最不可思议的力量和勇气；从耶稣的孤立和被排斥中，带来了人们聚集在一起，在最深的爱与团结中结合。换句话说，从可怕的事件中，通过这些可怕的事情，因为那些可怕的事情发生了，最终带来的是巨大的好处。保罗在《罗马书》8章28节中说：“我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。” 无论坏事和好事、小事和大事、大事和重要事，所有的事都在那些爱神的人身上互相效力，成为好的结果。

现在让我快速告诉你这并不是一种表面的、甜腻的人生观，它不是说，每朵乌云后面都有银边。在拉撒路的墓前，耶稣的朋友拉撒路已经死了。耶稣去了坟墓那里，周围的人都在哭泣。耶稣即将要做的事情正是保罗在《罗马书》8章28节中所说的。

他会从这一切坏事中带来好事，把荣耀和喜悦带入这个世界，如果没有拉撒路死去，这些就不会存在。所以他会从坏事中带来好事。他会使这一切最终对你有益，但祂并不是在坟墓旁轻蔑地笑。耶稣没有来到坟墓前说：“你们看，我马上要做什么？

”祂并没有嘲笑。祂也没有说：“我要从死里复活他。”祂是与哀哭的人一同哭泣。约翰福音11章中的坟墓几乎让你不得不想到伟大的威尔士诗人狄兰·托马斯的一句著名诗句。

他说：“不要安静地进入那夜晚，反抗光明消逝的狂怒吧。”耶稣在那里正是这样做的。祂在反抗死亡——将灵魂与身体分离。祂在反抗不公——将种族或人彼此隔绝。

所有神所结合的事物，所有使事物分裂的事物，在神看来都是坏事。它们本身就是邪恶的，并不只是因为换个角度看问题，它们就不是真的坏事了。它们是坏事，非常糟糕。耶稣恨这些事。

祂哭泣，对这些事感到愤怒。但罗马书8章28节说：“我们晓得万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处。”神在掌控一切，最终会战胜那些真正邪恶的事物。所以，尽管现在看起来很糟，但神会将所有坏事和一切不利因素转化为对你有益的结果。

你可能会问：这是如何实现的呢？当然，我认为有两种方式可以解释这一点。一种相对容易理解；另一种则难以理解。比较容易理解的方式就在这里： 罗马书8章28节说：“他使万事互相效力。

”第29节又说：“祂的计划是要我们与祂儿子的形像相似。”这就是我们可以理解的部分。你可能认为自己最大的问题是处境，比如如果能赚到更多的钱、找到更好的工作或打开某个门就好了。但实际情况是，处境无法摧毁你的生命。

性格缺陷的影响。**真正的问题是**你自己的品格。这会摧毁你。愚蠢、骄傲、自私和否认自己的罪与缺点，还有心硬如石，最重要的是，自欺欺人地认为自己可以不依靠上帝就处理好生活中的事情。

所有这些错误，所有的缺陷和性格上的问题，几乎总是需要经历一些糟糕的事情才能被我们敲醒。大多数活了两三个十年以上的人（没有冒犯任何人），无论是谁，在经历了许多事情之后，留下了伤痕，那些伤痛仍然在刺痛着我们，但从中获得的洞察力、品格或力量却是无价之宝。这正是我们在其中得到的一点启示。各种糟糕的事情都会发生在你身上，通过这些事情，上帝会将你塑造得像他的儿子一样。

没有这种契合就没有**真正的喜悦。所以你说，这就完了？所有的坏事只是**为了让我变得更好？不，不能这么认为，因为上帝显然在所有事情中都为好的结果工作，这一点我们永远无法完全理解。

如果你要能够应对生活中的困难，你就必须知道这一点：上帝正在将一切事情转化为对你有利的结果。你不可能完全理解这种转化的方式。对我来说，这是最直接、最重要的地方可以看到这一点。我自己来说，我不会为你忏悔罪行，我会为自己忏悔。

如果我在十字架下的那个阴暗下午，像很多人一样站在那里，我知道所有人都知道的事情——他是个好人，很有能力。这里有一个有能力做善事的人，他在治愈人们，喂饱人们，有着巨大的潜力。然而，在33岁的时候他的生命却被截断了，这是一个悲剧性的死亡。很明显，上帝抛弃了他。

事实上，他说神已经离弃了他。如果我在场，看到所有其他人的情况，我可能会抬头看着说：“我看不出神从这一切中能带来什么好处。”或许我会带着失去信仰回家，至少是动摇了信心。因为我不明白神如何能从中带来巨大的好处。

那将是神为人类所做的最伟大的事情之一。因为它不符合我的思维模式和分类标准。我会说：“我看不出来神在做什么。”换句话说，如果有一个无限的神，当然他有我们无法考虑、无法理解的原因。

不思考这一点是自以为是的极点。所以，如果我在十字架下这样做，而我猜你也可能会在那时那样做——当你感到被抛弃，一切似乎都发生在你身上，你看不到任何好的理由时，不要犯同样的错误。我们的坏事最终会变成好事。这是非常重要的一件事，圣诞节向我们展示了这一点。

其次，我们的**真正的好事永远不会从我们手中夺走。这就是**圣诞节向我们展示的第二件事。为什么呢？因为圣诞节向我们展示了神救恩的彻底恩典。

## 超越宗教表现 / Beyond Religious Performance

Then he will bless me. If I live the life I ought to live, then he will bless me and save me. But the trajectory of the gospel is from God to us.

See, at Christmas, God is basically saying, you're never going to get up to me. I've got to come down to you. You're just never going to make it.

And therefore he traverses the entire chasm between humanity and God. He comes all the way. He comes all the way right to us.

And when Jesus comes, he comes poor and weak. William Billings, that great hymn. There's that great line where William Billings says, seek not in courts nor palaces nor royal curtains draw.

But search the stable. See your God. Extend it on the straw.

God, extend it on the straw. See, why does God come not as a general on the head of an army? Not as a king on a throne?

Why does he come poor and weak? I'll tell you why. He does not come as a strong one for the strong.

He's not a God who helps those who help themselves. No way. He comes for people who are weak and who can't do what we need to do.

So he comes to suffer. He comes to die. He comes to pay the penalty for our sins.

He comes, therefore, to give us love, salvation benefits that are unconditional. Because they're not based on us, any condition in us. It's love beyond condition.

It's love beyond degree. And that's what this passage is all about. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365-day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with Him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help Gospel and Life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

So, for example, look at that place where it says, he foreknows us. What do you think that means? You might say, oh, foreknows means he foresees us.

No. Just keep this in mind. Knowing in the Bible is a very relational word.

To know about something is a cognitive thing. To know something is an experiential thing. You can know about someone, but not know them.

And therefore, when it says God foreknows us, what it's really saying is not that he foresees us, but he foreloves us. He puts his love on us before we do anything in his direction. That's how unconditional and aggressive his love is.

So, if you want a perfect example of it, the prodigal son. You know, here comes the prodigal son. Does the father sit there and say, does he stay on the porch tapping his foot, saying, this better be good?

Does the father say, if he repents, then I'll shower him with love? No. He runs to him and he kisses him and pounces on him and showers him with love, enabling him, making it far easier to repent.

Our love does not evoke God's love. God's love evokes ours. That's how radical and that's how unconditional it is.

And if you say, well, what about free will? I told you I'd come back. Why don't you just accept the gift right now?

And here's what the gift is. Here's what the gift is. God's not just a boss.

He's a father. A boss can like an employee. But if that employee screws up over and over and over again, even the nicest boss starts to say, how do I get rid of her?

How do I get rid of him? Even the nicest boss, if he screws up over and over and over again, he starts to say, how am I going to get rid of him? But when a child screws up over and over again, all that does is make the parent more intensely concerned about the child.

It intensifies the love of the parent. It focuses the love of the parent. The more you screw up, the more your parental love explodes in the direction of the child.

And that means what? The really great things that you have. Your justification, we talked about this, made right with him.

Your adoption into the family. Your relationship with him. These things can't be taken away from you.

See, nothing it says at the very end. In all creation, inside you or outside you can separate you from the love of God. That means that the absolute sovereign of the universe, to whom the galaxies are like dust on the scales, loves you with the unconditional intensity of a parent.

人类宗教的发展轨迹是：我塑造神的形象。我必须通过道德努力和意识转变等途径来接近神。然后他才会祝福我，拯救我。如果我过着应该过的生活，他就会祝福我并拯救我。

但福音的信息是从神到我们。你看，在圣诞节的时候，神基本上在说：“你永远不可能达到我的高度。我必须来到你们中间。”你永远达不到这个高度。

因此，神跨越了人类与他的整个鸿沟，一路走来，来到了我们身边。当耶稣来的时候，他是贫穷而弱小的。威廉·比林斯，那位伟大的圣诗作者，在他的作品中有一句名言：“不要在法庭里寻找，也不要在宫殿里寻找，也不要从王室的帷幕中寻求。” 但要到马槽里去寻找。

看看你的神。让他躺在稻草上。神，让他躺在稻草上。为什么神不以将军的身份驾着大军而来？

为什么不以国王的姿态坐在宝座上？他为什么要贫穷而弱小呢？让我告诉你原因。他不是来帮助那些自力更生的人的强大力量。

他不是那种只帮助那些能自救的人的神。绝不是这样。他是为那些软弱无力、无法自己解决问题的人而来。所以他来受苦，来死，来为我们罪孽付出代价。

因此，他来是要赐给我们无条件的爱和救赎的好处。因为这些好处不依赖于我们，也不依赖于我们身上的任何条件。这是超越一切条件之上的爱。这是超越程度之上的爱。

这就是这段经文的核心所在。诗篇可以深刻地影响你与神的关系。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。在蒂姆和凯西·凯勒的365天灵修读物《耶稣的歌》中，你可以找到每天通过诗篇的阅读，并获得新的圣经洞见。

如果你还没有定期灵修的习惯，这本书是一个非常好的开始。而如果你已经花时间在研读和祷告上，那么通过诗篇的阅读和祷告可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与祂更深一层的亲密关系。作为您对福音与生命事工的支持表示感谢，我们将寄送一本蒂姆和凯西·凯勒的灵修读物给您。请访问gospelandlife.com/slash-give 获取您的副本。

这是gospelandlife.com/slash-give。现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。例如，在那里说祂预先知道我们，你觉得这代表什么意思？你可能会想，预知就是预见我们。

不，要记住这一点：在圣经中，“知道”是一个非常关系性的词。知道某事是认知上的事情。而真正认识某人则是体验上的事情。你可以知道某人的信息，但不一定真正了解他们。

因此，当圣经说神预先知道我们时，并不是说他预见了我们，而是说他预先爱上了我们。在他向我们施爱之前，我们就没有任何行为指向他。这就是他的爱有多么无条件和强烈。所以，如果你要找一个完美的例子，那就是浪子回头的故事。

你知道，浪子回来了。父亲会坐在门口，脚尖点地，说“这回一定要好好表现”吗？父亲会不会说：“如果他悔改了，我才会给他更多的爱？”不会的。

父亲跑过去迎接他，亲吻他，扑上去拥抱他，并且用无尽的爱包围着他，使他更容易悔改。我们的爱不能引发神的爱；恰恰相反，是神的爱激发了我们对他的爱。这就是它多么激进和无条件。如果你问：“那自由意志呢？

我曾说过我会回来。你为什么不现在就接受这份礼物呢？” 这里就是那份礼物：这里就是那份礼物。神不只是一个老板，他是一位父亲。

一个老板可以喜欢员工，但如果这个员工一而再、再而三地犯错，即使是最好的老板也会想：“我要怎么摆脱她？”“我要怎么摆脱他？”即使是最友善的老板，如果一个人一而再、再而三地犯错，他也可能会想：“我该怎么摆脱他？”但是，当一个孩子一而再、再而三地犯错时，只会让父母对孩子更加关心。

你犯错越多，父母对你的爱就越强烈。这种爱会更加集中和激增。你犯的错误越多，父母对你之爱的强度就越大。这意味着什么？

意味着你真正拥有的最伟大的东西——你的称义、我们之前讨论过的与神和好；你的收养身份、你的家庭关系——这些都无法被夺走。你看，圣经最后一句说：“在基督里，并且无论是在地上还是在天上，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝。”**这意味着宇宙的绝对主宰，他对银河系就像对尘埃一样轻视，却以父母般的无条件之爱爱你。**这就是第二点。

圣诞节向我们展示了这一点：你的坏事最终会变成好事。您最真正的好东西永远不会被夺走。而最好的还在后头。现在，我们看到的第三件事在第30节。

## 坏事变为祝福 / Bad Things Turn to Good

That's the second thing. And Christmas shows us this. Your bad things will turn out for good.

Your most truly good things can never be taken away from you. And the best things are yet to come. Now the third thing actually we see is in verse 30.

If you go through 28, 29 and 30, we see, as we already saw, he for loves us. He puts his love on us. He calls us.

He justifies us, gives us the right relationship with us. And then he glorifies us. No, actually that's not what it says.

It's all past tense. And that's not how we would talk. You see what Paul is saying?

Commentators have been noticing this for centuries actually. It's actually very striking. What you and I would say is talking to Christians.

He put his love on you. He called you. He justified you.

He pardoned you. And someday he will glorify you. That's not what Paul says.

He says he's already glorified you. Past tense. Past tense?

Here's what he's saying. First of all, our future glory, because of what Jesus Christ has done, has been made so certain, he can talk about it this way. It is so certain.

You say, how could it be that certain? We've got him, you know, that goes like this. It's where God is speaking.

It's a how firm a foundation. And the last lines go, that soul that on Jesus has leaned for repose. I will not, I will not desert to its foes.

That soul, though, all hell should endeavor to shake. I'll never, no, never, never forsake. That word.

There is the key. How is it possible that God could never forsake us? Because Jesus on the cross said, you forsaken me.

Jesus was forsaken in our place, so that we will never be forsaken. Or another way to put it, is Jesus lost the glory. Philippians 2, he emptied himself of his glory.

Isaiah 53, he had no beauty by which we should desire him. He absolutely lost his glory. He became pitiful.

He became small, shriveled. He became inconsequential. He lost all his glory so that we could have it so certainly, so assuredly, that Paul can talk about it in the past tense.

Now, if that's the case, that I believe Paul is saying, as I read this entire chapter, and we talked about this somewhat last week as well. Here's what I think Paul is saying. Paul is saying, I believe so much in the brutality of life.

I do not have rose-colored glasses. I don't have a kind of mind-over-matter idea about this. I would never say, oh, you know, things aren't so bad if you just learned to look at it this way.

I so believe in the brutality of life, the inevitable brutality of life, that unless I knew there was glory coming to me, I would not be able to lead a meaningful life in the midst of all this suffering. Paul is saying, only glory makes it possible to realistically face how bad life is and live a meaningful life in the midst of it, even a triumphant life in the midst of it, only knowing what he says here, and up in verse 18, and over in 2 Corinthians 4, where he says, I consider that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us. I believe he says in 2 Corinthians 4, the suffering of this present time is preparing a weight of glory for us, for as our outward nature waits away, our inward is being renewed every day.

What is he talking about? There's two things. It's how we're going to close.

The first of all, he's saying, if you understand what Paul is saying here, he's saying, that when we suffer in Christ, holding on to Christ, it makes us more real. I mean, it makes us more real. Because the word glory, animologically, means weighty or solid.

And actually, if you think about this, we've been talking about this all through this series. If everybody loves their, your career is important to everybody. And so if you have problems in your career, it's going to shake you.

But if you've completely built your life on your career, if your whole identity is in your career, then when something goes wrong with your career, you're going to be shattered. Just shattered. You know you left.

No self left. And that's the reason that instead of putting our weight on things that are always shifting around and always shaking, when you put your weight on the rock, when you root yourself more firmly in the love of God and what he says about you, what he's done for you, you become more solid, you become more stable, you become actually more real. That is to say, you actually become something someone who's going to last, no matter what.

Suffering when it gets you more deeply into God, when it drives you more deeply into God and into what he's done for you, it makes you more real. Now the reason I know that Paul's right is because the Velveteen Rabbit agrees with him. So for example, the skin horse says to the Velveteen Rabbit, when a child loves you for a long, long time, then you become real.

Does it hurt? Ask the Velveteen Rabbit? Oh yes, to the skin horse.

That's why it doesn't happen to those who break easily or who have to be very carefully handled. By the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out, and you get really loose in the joints, and you look awfully shabby. But once you are real, you can't be ugly, except to the people who don't understand.

从28、29和30节来看，正如我们之前已经看到的，他爱我们，把他的爱放在我们身上，呼召我们。他使我们与神和好，赐给我们正确的关系，并且荣耀我们。但其实不是这样的。这里都是过去时态。

这并不是我们通常说话的方式。你看到了保罗在说什么吗？实际上，评论家们已经注意到这一点几个世纪了，这确实非常引人注目。我们和你们会说的，是这样对基督徒来说的话： 他把他的爱放在你身上，呼召你，使你与神和好。

赦免你，并且有一天他会荣耀你。但保罗并不是这么说的。他说他已经荣耀了你们，用过去时态。过去时态？

这就是他在说什么。首先，因为耶稣基督所做的一切，我们的未来荣耀已经变得如此确定，以至于他可以用这种方式来谈论它。它是如此确定。你说，这怎么可能这么确定呢？

我们有他啊，你知道，这是神在说话的地方。就像《何西阿歌》中说的那样：“坚固的基础。”最后一句是：“那依靠耶稣得以安息的灵魂，我绝不会弃绝给它的敌人。” 那灵魂，纵然全地都起来攻击它。

我绝不、绝不、绝不离弃它。这个关键在于：神怎么可能永远不弃绝我们呢？因为耶稣在十字架上说，“你离弃了我。”耶稣被弃绝是为了我们的缘故，所以我们永远不会被弃绝。

或者说，另一种说法是，耶稣失去了荣耀。腓立比书2章提到，他空了自己。以赛亚书53章也说，他没有美处，我们不会渴望他。他完全失去了他的荣耀，变得可怜、渺小、微不足道，以至于我们可以如此确定和无疑地拥有它，以至于保罗可以用过去时态来谈论它。

现在，如果这是真的，正如我读这一整章时所相信的，并且我们在上周也稍微讨论过这一点。我认为保罗在说什么是这样的：保罗说，他对生命的残酷性有着极大的信心。我没有玫瑰色的眼镜。我并没有一种心胜一切的想法。

我绝不会说，你知道的，事情并不是那么糟糕，只要你换个角度看。我相信生活的残酷性，这种不可避免的生活残酷性，除非我知道荣耀即将来临，否则我无法在这一切苦难中过上有意义的生活。保罗说，只有知道荣耀才能让我们真实地面对生活有多么糟糕，并在这种困境中活出有意义甚至胜利的人生。他在《哥林多后书》4章18节提到：“我们这至暂至轻的苦楚，要为我们成就极重无比、永远的荣耀。

”在2 Corinthians 4章他也说：“我以为，苦难在这临时之世是不配与将来在他我们里面要显出来的荣耀相比的。” 他在说什么呢？有两个要点。这是我们要总结的两方面。

首先，他说，如果你理解保罗在这里所说的，当我们在基督里受苦时，紧紧抓住基督，这会使我们更加真实。因为“荣耀”这个词，在意义上意味着沉重或坚实。实际上，如果我们想想这一点，我们在这整个系列中一直在讨论这个问题。如果每个人都重视你的职业，那么你的职业生涯对你来说非常重要。

所以如果你的职业生涯出现问题，它会让你动摇。但如果你把生活的全部都建立在你的职业生涯上，如果你的身份完全依赖于你的职业，那么一旦你的职业生涯出了问题，你就会彻底崩溃。彻底崩溃。你知道的，没有自我了。

这就是为什么我们不应该把我们的重量放在那些总是摇摆不定的东西上，而是要依靠那块磐石，在神的爱和他对你所说的话、所做的事中扎根更深，这样你会变得更加坚实，更加稳定，实际上也会变得更真实。也就是说，你将成为一个无论发生什么都能持久的人。受苦当你因此更深入地认识神，更深入地经历他为你所做的一切时，会使你更加真实。现在我知道保罗是对的，因为《绒布兔子》也同意他的观点。

例如，皮肤马对绒布兔子说：“当一个孩子长时间地爱你，你就变得真实了。” 受苦吗？问一问绒布兔子吧？当然，对于皮肤马来说是这样。

所以那些容易破碎或需要小心呵护的人不会经历这种真实。到你真正成为真实的时候，你的大部分毛发已经被爱脱落，眼睛也掉出来了，关节松垮了，看起来很破旧。但一旦你变得真实，除了那些不懂的人，你是无法丑陋的。你知道约翰·牛顿那首赞美诗吗？

神在对我们说话，其中有一句说：“这些内在的试炼，我用来从骄傲和自我中释放你，并打破你对尘世快乐的计划，使你能找到我的一切。”你看，首先，受苦实际上现在正在让他更加荣耀。你的内心正日复一日地被更新。荣耀正在为我们准备无上的荣耀，但这还不是全部，未来的荣耀将压倒一切。

当我们思考这一点时，保罗说：“我算计现在的苦难，不值一提，与将来要显给我们的荣耀相比。” 未来的荣耀将带来视角的转变，并使我们能够面对眼前的困难。这就是圣特蕾莎之所以能说：“耶稣第一次亲吻你，第一次荣耀的一刻，将会让你之前经历的所有痛苦，看起来就像在一个糟糕旅馆里度过的一个晚上。” 这就是陀思妥耶夫斯基能够说出“我相信痛苦将会得到治愈和补偿，在世界的终结、永恒和谐的时刻，将会有如此珍贵的事情发生，足以抚慰所有的心灵，弥补人类所有的罪行，洗刷他们所流的所有鲜血，使原谅不仅成为可能，而且是正当的。

”的原因。这听起来非常激进，但保罗正是在谈论这样的事情。现在，让我把这一切总结一下。你们明白了吗？

这种荣耀已经让你变得光荣了，甚至现在的痛苦也能让你变得光荣，总有一天我们会被即将揭示出来的荣耀所遮盖。C·S·刘易斯给我们的一个比喻将所有这些联系在一起，我来读给你们听，不过我不做解释。有一次弗兰内利·奥康纳被问到能否告诉我们她的故事的意义时，她说如果她能在一句话或一个句子中表达出来，她就不用写这个故事了。我也得说同样的话。

## 上帝之爱的深度 / The Depth of God's Love

And you know that John Newton hymn that goes where God is speaking to us basically, and the John Newton hymn where God says, these inward trials, these inward trials I employ from pride and self to set thee free and break thy schemes of earthly joy that thou mayst find thine all in me. See, first of all, suffering is actually making him more glorious now. Your inward person is being renewed day by day.

Glory is preparing a weight of glory now, but not only that, the future glory overwhelms. Overwhelms. As we think about it, Paul says, I reckon that the suffering in his present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that should be revealed to us.

The future glory overwhelms and puts perspective and enables us to face what we've gotten in front of us. That's the reason why St. Teresa of Avala was able to say, the first kiss from Jesus, the first second of glory, is going to make all the suffering you've ever experienced, seem like one night in a bad hotel.

That's the reason why Dostoevsky is going to be able to say, I believe that suffering will be healed and made up for it, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass, that it will suffice for all hearts for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, of all the blood that they've shed, that it will make it not just possible to forgive, but to justify everything that's happened. That's awfully radical, but something like that is what Paul's talking about. Now, let me draw it all together.

Do you understand that this glory is already making you, pardon me, the suffering can already be making you glorious and someday we'll be overshadowed by the glory that is to be revealed? There's a metaphor that kind of a story that CS Lewis gives us that draws all of this together, and I'm just going to read it to you, and not going to comment on it. There's a place where Flenery O'Connor was once asked, could you tell us the meaning of your story?

Could you just put it in one line, one sentence, and she said, if I could put it in one line or sentence, I wouldn't have had to write the story. And I have to say the same thing about this. Don't ask me what it means.

It means more than I can tell you. It's about a ghost from hell, not very real, you know. Who comes to the Oscars of Heaven, this is a fiction, by the way, and is looking longingly toward Heaven, and an angel comes down to try to meet him, but he's got a little red lizard on his shoulder, and the lizard doesn't want to go, so that ghost turns around very sadly to leave.

And the angel calls and says, hey, why are you leaving so soon? And the ghost says, well, this little fella here doesn't really want to go in that direction so I can't. And the angel says, would you like me to make it quiet?

And the ghost says, well, it would be a relief. Then I will kill him, said the angel. Oh, you didn't say anything about killing it.

It's the only way, said the angel. May I kill it? Well, let's discuss that.

There is no time. May I kill it? Oh, look, it's gone to sleep.

I'm sure it won't be any trouble anymore. Yes, it will. May I kill it?

Well, I think the gradual process is always better than, no, the gradual process is of no use at all. May I kill it? Get back!

You're hurting me. You didn't tell me it would hurt me. I never said it wouldn't hurt you.

I said it wouldn't kill you. May I kill it? Look, let me run back by tonight's bus and get an opinion from my own doctor, come to you the first moment I can.

This moment contains all moments. May I kill it? And then the lizard began chattering to the ghost, so loud that everyone could hear what it was saying.

He can do it. He can kill me. And then what would you do without me?

Oh, I admit, I've sometimes gone too far in the past, but I promise I won't do it again. I'll be very good. May I kill it?

Said the angel. Oh, do it. Do it.

Get it over with, cry the ghost. But God helped me. God helped me.

Then the angel grabbed hold of the lizard and broke its neck and threw it down and the ghost screams and two amazing things happen. First of all, the ghost stops being ghostly and becomes radiant and gorgeous and bright and real and a human being, a man. But the body of the red lizard, instead of disappearing, it grows into a beautiful, powerful white horse.

And the text goes on, when the new-made man arose, I thought his face shone with tears, but it may have been only the liquid love and brightness which flowed from him. Enjoy his haste. The man leaped upon the horse's back.

They were off like a shooting star on the green plane and were soon to the mountains. Still like a star, I saw them winding up, scaling what seemed impossible steps quicker every moment until the brow of the landscape, so high that I strained my neck to see them, they vanished, bright themselves into the rose brightness of that everlasting morning. Our slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.

I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor anything to come, nor height, nor depth, nor anything in all creation is able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Let's pray. Father, our bad things will turn out for good.

Our most truly good things can never be taken from us and our best things are yet to come. The realities that Christmas points to become effective in our lives through these truths, let these truths have their way with us, make us real, give us the ability to live meaningful lives, even joyous lives, in the midst of our grief and suffering. We thank you that it's possible through Jesus.

It's in His name that we ask it. Amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

不要问我**这意味着什么。**它意味着的比我能告诉你的更多。这是一个来自地狱的幽灵，不太真实的一个形象，在天堂奥斯卡颁奖典礼上满怀渴望地望着天堂，天使下来试图与他见面，但他的肩膀上有一只小红蜥蜴，蜥蜴不想去，所以这个幽灵很悲伤地转身准备离开。天使喊道：“你为什么要这么快就走？

” 幽灵说：“因为这里的小家伙不愿意往那个方向去，所以我不能。” 天使说：“你想让我让它安静下来吗？” 幽灵说：“那会是一个解脱。” “我会杀了它。

”天使说，“哦，你没提到要杀它。” “这是唯一的办法。”天使说，“我可以杀它吗？” “好吧，让我们讨论一下吧。

” 没有时间了。“我可以杀它吗？” “哦，看，它睡着了。” 我肯定不会再有麻烦了。

不，会有麻烦的。“我可以杀它吗？” > 这个故事里的幽灵象征着那些在天堂颁奖典礼上满怀渴望地望着天堂的灵魂，但因为一个小红蜥蜴（代表内心的恐惧或罪恶感）而无法进入天堂。天使试图帮助他解决这个问题，最终通过“杀死”那个小红蜥蜴来实现这个目标，象征着克服内心的障碍和罪恶感的过程。

好吧，我认为渐进的过程总是比没有用处的更好。我可以杀死它吗？退回去！你伤害我了。

你没告诉我这会伤害我。我从没说过不会伤害你。我说不会杀掉你。我可以杀死它吗？

你看，让我赶今晚的最后一班车去找我的医生咨询一下意见，一有机会就来找你。这一刻包含了所有的时刻。我可以杀死它吗？然后蜥蜴开始对鬼魂大声说话，声音大到所有人都能听见。

他能做到。他可以杀了我。那你没有了我会怎么办？哦，我承认，过去我有时做得太过分了，但我保证不会再这样做了。

我会变得很好。我可以杀死它吗？天使说。“好吧，去做吧。

” 快点做吧，鬼魂哭喊着。“但上帝帮助了我。”鬼魂叫道。然后天使抓住蜥蜴，折断它的脖子扔到地上，鬼魂尖叫起来。

两件神奇的事情发生了。首先，鬼魂不再显得那么幽灵般，而是变得光彩照人、美丽而明亮，成为一个真实的人类，一个男人。但那只红色的蜥蜴的身体没有消失，反而长成了一匹美丽的、强大的白马。文本继续写道：当新造的人站起来时，我认为他的脸庞闪耀着泪水，但也可能是他从内心流露出的爱和光芒。

享受他的急切行动吧。那人跳上了马背。他们像流星一样飞驰在绿色的大地上，很快就到了山脚下。仍然像一颗星，我看到他们在蜿蜒而上，攀爬看似不可能的阶梯，速度越来越快，直到那片高地，那么高以至于我伸长脖子也看不见他们，他们消失在了玫瑰色的永恒清晨中。

我们短暂的痛苦正在为我们预备一个无法比拟的荣耀重担。我相信无论是死、生、天使、权柄、能力、现在的事物还是将来的事物，无论是在天上还是在地上，都不能使我们与神的爱隔绝，这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。让我们祷告：父亲，我们的坏事最终都会变成好事。我们最真正的好东西永远不会被夺走，而我们最好的东西还在未来等着我们。

圣诞所指向的真实，在这些真理中生效于我们的生命之中。让这些真理在我们心中生根发芽，使我们真实地生活，赋予我们在悲伤和痛苦中也能过上有意义、甚至快乐生活的能力。我们感谢你借着耶稣让我们有这样的可能。这是在耶稣的名下我们祈求的。
