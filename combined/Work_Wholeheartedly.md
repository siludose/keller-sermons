# Work Wholeheartedly / Work Wholeheartedly

## Chinese Translation / 中文翻译 / English Transcript

Welcome to Gospel and Life. If you have a job, it's likely that you think about it a lot. But how much of you thought about the Biblical approach to your work?

Today, on Gospel and Life, Tim Keller shows us that the Bible has incredibly helpful and practical wisdom we can apply to the work we do. Some you may find surprising, even life-changing. Ephesians 6.

We're going to read verses 5 through 9. Something about the subject, please. We had a long series on marriage, as you know, as we got to Ephesians 5.

And last week in this week, I've just decided to move on through quickly two very important subjects, not necessarily the most inspiring subjects, not the kind of sermons or preaching that everybody comes out saying, wow, that was so inspiring. The one subject is the relationships of parents to children, that was last week. And today, the relationships within the workplace of master to servant, of employer, of manager to worker.

Now, we're going to look at that tonight, and this will be the only night we talk about again, and I'll get back to it in a second. Again, it's not the most inspiring subject, and yet, it is so important, because when you stop and consider how much of your time, how much of your life is built around your work, and when you consider that the average Christian, when they, he or she sits down to try to say, what does it mean for me to live my life out as a Christian? If somebody gives you a book on discipleship, here's what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, here's what it means to be a Christian and to walk as a Christian.

You will find, if you look carefully, that basically, that's really telling you, most almost all that material, and I had to know I've written some of it, so I'm part of it. Almost all that material tells you how to be a Christian in the evenings and on the weekends. And since so many of you work on Saturday and get home at 10 o'clock at night, there's really not a lot of time in which you can be a Christian, because you see, nobody's telling you how to be a Christian on the job and in your work.

So we have to look at it. I need to say, though, like I said, it's not so much inspiring material as it is important material, it's material that takes all of your wisdom to apply. It's not going to be easy to apply, but you have to say, unless I get this, unless I get the hang of this, there's large sections of my life in which I'm not really letting Christ impact my behavior.

Starting next week, we're going to start a series, we're going to get down to chapter six, verse 10. And I'm just letting you know that we're going to start another series. Basically, this is a series of series with a couple of connector things, like the one this week we're doing, but when we get down to verse 10 where it says, finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power, put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes, for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the authorities and against powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms, therefore put on the full armor of God.

We're going to take a lot of time to look at that. I think that there is a tremendous amount of teaching in this passage, it's actually verse 10 to 20 of chapter six. It's about spiritual warfare, it's about supernatural evil, it's about, it's actually in many ways, about what it means to live the Christian life militarily.

And it doesn't mean that Christian is somebody who likes war, doesn't mean that Christian is somebody, a hawk in the Gulf War, what we're talking instead of is a Christian, is a person who is absolutely realistic about the nature of life. Christians do not look through their life at life through rose colored glasses because the Bible is not a set of rose colored glasses. The Bible says the Christian can be known as much for the fight in his life as for the peace in his life.

In fact there is a certain sense in which the way the real difference in a Christian and non-Christian is not that a Christian has got a life of peace and non-Christian life of conflict, but rather that when you become a Christian, places you had conflict, you develop peace and places you had peace, you develop conflict. What happens is the battle moves around and Christianity is by no means, like I said sentimental, it says a Christian is somebody who knows that it's a very, very difficult, dangerous world out there. You expect to be shot at all the time.

You're never running home saying, you know as Elizabeth Eliot once said, if you're in the ring and you got the box or trunks on, don't come running back to the guy in the corner saying, that man hit me. Because your coach will say, if you don't want to get hit, get out of the ring. Being a Christian means you're in the ring.

You can't complain about the fact that you come home every day bloody. A Christian is somebody who instead of saying that man hit me, a Christian says, I've got to get on, the armor, I've got to get prepared, I've got to see what it is. So we're going to spend a pretty good amount of time talking about the fact that Christianity is a fight.

One great book on the Christian life by John White, it's an interversely pressed book. Many of you may know it's one of the best overall books to give somebody who wants to understand what does it mean to live a Christian life. It's called the fight.

He's realistic, okay? Now, but today, tonight, I would just look at briefly, but at another area where there's a lot of fighting going on, even if it's not outside, it's certainly inside. And I'd like to look at Ephesians 6, and I'm just going to read verses 5 to 9, and map out this evening some of the most basic principles of what back, what God tells you, you must do in approaching work in a Christian way, in approaching your job.

Let me just read from verses 5 to 9, slaves, you say, oh, this is me, okay. Obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them, not only to win their favor, but when their eyes on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart, serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.

And masters treat your slaves in the same way, do not threaten them since you know that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. This is God's word, all right? Some general principles, then some practical, general and background, and then practical.

This passage raises a lot of thorny issues, and fortunately since we're not making the Christian and work a series, I'll just pass lightly on all of them, but again they're important. Is you must keep in mind that this is another indication that Christianity is a whole life religion, that Christianity has to touch every part of your life, that you're not a Christian unless every part of your life has been completely reoriented. Actually, this is another way of saying that a Christian doesn't do anything like a non-Christian.

Oh, a Christian does plenty of things that non-Christians do, but no, a Christian doesn't do anything in the same way. Otherwise, why would Paul work out in such detail in every area of life? If you've been coming in the evening through Ephesians, you'll see that in every single area of life, Paul says, this is what it means to be filled with a spirit, in communication.

This is what it means in your marriage, this is what it means in your family, this is what it means in your relationship to your parents in your workplace, this is what it means in your social relationships, this is what it means in your understanding of culture and so on. Why would Paul say that unless a Christian in every area is doing things differently? That means that Christianity is not a Sunday thing or an evening thing.

It's an all day, it's a whole life thing. That's the reason when Paul says, be filled with a spirit, he works out in every single area of life. Secondly, you really got to keep in mind that Paul is still telling people what it means to be filled with a spirit.

Now the trouble with long-winded preachers like myself is that it's been weeks and weeks. I forget. I do, and I think when we looked at verse 17 of chapter 5 and 18 where it says don't be drunk with wine but be filled with a spirit, and then he goes on and says, being filled with a spirit means that you talk to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and you make melody in your heart to the Lord and you thank God for everything.

Hmm. How did I do that? Hmm.

Oh, there we go. Wow, I got to be careful about that. That was the mic.

That was not me, honest. I should not. I didn't have supper.

So, shoo, boy. I'm not that long-winded here. So anyway, long-winded.

When you're long-winded you might sometimes a minister like myself can make you lose track. Of the fact that Paul is still talking about what it means to be filled with a spirit because in verse 21 he said, submit to one another. Then he begins to move into all areas of life to show how spirit filled people relate to the people around them.

Now, this should at least tell you this, especially those of you who have come out of churches that put lots of emphasis on being filled with a spirit. I think we got to last week in the morning services was this. When the Bible talks about what it means to be filled with spirit, it always talks about the heart.

The heart is affected by the spirit. Now, something that probably needs to be brought out all the time is in the Bible. The word heart does not really have the same meaning that it tends to have in English.

In English, the word heart means the emotions. The heart is something that's opposed to the head. That's the reason why Maria can say, my head tells me one thing, but my heart needs to, my heart tells me that this is what I want to do.

You see the heart and the head are put against one another. In the Bible, the word heart is the seat of the whole soul. That means you can think with your heart and you can will with your heart and you can feel with your heart and you'll see different places in the Bible where it talks about as a man thinketh in his heart and so forth.

The heart is the seat of the mind, the will and the emotions and the way you know that the spirit of God is really affecting you in the heart is that your religion is not just emotional. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago in the morning service, not just emotional and not just volitional and not just intellectual. There's a very, very important thing to consider.

Some of you know, some of you have been converted since you started coming to this church and yet you were very religious before. Now, you're an interesting kind of person and very often sitting down, you can look back and say, you know, my parents aren't going to believe this. A lot of people aren't going to believe this because I've been in church for years and yet I was never a Christian until I came here.

And very often if you sit down and talk and you think about it, you'll be able to identify that you didn't understand the gospel, but there was some signs. You should have been aware of it because in some cases your religion was nothing but intellectual. That means you thought about the Bible and you knew a lot and you argued about it and you got your thinking straight.

And yet there was never any emotional sense of the presence of God, there was never any passion, there was never any warmth, that's the emotional side. And volitionally, that means in behavior, there was never much in the way of change going on in your life. You couldn't say, well, I'm more loving than I was last year, I'm more patient than I was last year, I'm more wise than I was last year.

Then other folks say my life was a volitional one. That means I was a very dutiful, disciplined person, but there was no growth in my thinking and I never since I had a real relationship with God, you see. Now many people may find that though they love worship and though they seem to be having tremendous emotional experiences and they say, therefore, I must be filled with a spirit.

Yet when it comes down to it, Paul is saying, if there isn't a progressive transformation in all of your living areas and your life relationships, you're not filled with the spirit. Being filled with the spirit is not a matter of crying at worship services. It's not a matter of super high emotions though, of course it includes those things, yes it does, but you know, to be filled with the spirit, you know it, you feel it.

But you can be thinking you're filled with the spirit and have an emotional experience unless it's working out in the way in which you relate to people on the job, in the way in which you relate to your parents and in all of these areas, unless those things have changed, you're not filled with the spirit. Now that's the most, in some ways, the most obvious point of this passage and you'd miss it completely unless you stand back and say, what is Paul saying? You look at the context which is hard to see again when you come to this church because I go on so slowly through the passage.

The main point is you're not filled with the spirit unless you find that the way in which you relate to people on the job has really been changed. Okay, now one more background area, one more background thing, a general thing, but it's not important, it's not practical, but it's a big issue, you can't really go buy it. In fact, if I don't go buy it, somebody's going to come up and ask me about it afterwards anyway.

Does this passage condone slavery? Now you see, there's been two kinds of enemies of the gospel who have really misused this passage. One kind, unfortunately, enemies of the gospel, where people who didn't think they were enemies of the gospel, they were people in the church, they were clergy who have used this passage to say, yes, slavery is fine.

And if you want to go back in the 1850s and the 1860s, you will find United States clergy men, especially in the south, justifying the institution of slavery on the basis of this passage. They say, hey, you know what it says to slaves, doesn't say get going? It says, oh, buy your masters.

It says you should, you see, well, there we go. And on the other hand, there's other people who have misused this. There's people who said, see, the Bible does condone slavery.

And that just shows that the Bible is, you know, a good book in many ways, but basically about where looking book, a primitive book, you know, a book with retrograde morality. This is an unworthy text. And so there's a lot of good things in the Bible, but basically there's things in the Bible that really are not good.

There's things that are backward looking, that are bad that we have to reject, that are immoral even. It supports this, it supports racism, it supports classism, it supports slavery and so on. Well, neither those folks are right, especially I have to say the latter people, it's an illogical thing to say, since the Bible condemns slavery.

And since we know slavery is wrong, therefore the Bible is characterized by inferior morality at this point. You see, friends, the Bible claims to be revelation from God. And if God has spoken, and if God has revealed Himself and said, this is what's right and this is what's wrong, then there really can be absolute principles of morality that we can say to everybody, no matter what you think, this is right and this is wrong.

This is a universal absolute truth, this is objective truth just like the law of gravity, you've got to believe it. But if there's no revelation, if there's no place that God has spoken and told us what is right and wrong, then all morality is a matter of opinion, all morality. And I like to know where you get this high standard of morality by which you can judge the Scripture, where does it come from?

You see, if there's no revelation, then it's a matter of opinion, and you might be, you might have your opinion, but there's no way you could consider this inferior. You see that? You know, basis for saying so.

Now, the fact is, the reason I know, and the reason you should know the slavery is wrong, is because we believe the Bible's revelation. First, there's two things you've got to say about this passage in slavery. First of all, no, of course it doesn't say in this spot, slaves go get loose.

You've got to remember, again, the context, the context is, what does it mean to be filled with the Spirit, and how is that going to affect tomorrow, every one of your relationships? It's natural and normal, in a sense, that the Bible never deals with a social issue abstractly. It always deals with it from the standpoint of how does this relate to your relationship with God?

Yeah, again, a couple of weeks ago, we've pointed this out. The Bible, in a sense, will not, this is in the morning service, so I'll bring this up here. I mention this.

The Bible, in a sense, does not even, well, not even, the New Testament will not even talk to you about most issues until you decide what you think about Jesus. There's a sense in which it won't even let you get to other issues. People will say, well, I'm interested in being a Christian, but I don't know what I believe about evolution.

Or they say, I'm interested in Christianity and I might be interested in Christ, but I don't understand what it means by turning the other cheek. Or I like a lot of things, but I'm afraid if I become a Christian, that this is going to change my politics one way or the other, or even a person says, I like to come to Christianity, but I first have to find out what I would have to do in this or that area of my life. And there's a sense in which the New Testament says, there's no way we're going to answer those questions.

There's no way the New Testament writers say we're going to answer those questions. First, what do you think of him? Now, the reason they do that is because they say if Christianity was basically an intellectual philosophy, then you could have your answers to your philosophical questions before you come to him.

But if Christianity is essentially a relationship, a personal relationship, then you have to figure out what you think of him, whether what he says about himself is true or not, and whether you're going to accept or reject him, otherwise, everything else the New Testament says makes no sense. It's silly to say, I don't know if Jesus is God, but I want to know what the Bible says what Christianity says about slavery. It's ridiculous to even ask a question like that.

The point is, if Jesus isn't God, who cares what the Bible says about slavery? If Jesus isn't God, who cares what anybody thinks? It's all a matter of opinion.

On the other hand, if Jesus is God, then we can talk. Once you understand that, once you accept him, once you receive him into your life, then all sorts of things that he says will start to make sense, but not until then. See that?

The great illustration is that marriage is a complex thing, as you know, so we spent nine weeks on it. There's all sorts of facets to it. And there's a lot of things that you do in marriage, a lot of issues, a lot of business you do, but every so often, one person or the other, right?

We'll suddenly stop and say, we can't do anything else because there's something wrong with our relationship. We can't make this decision. We can't go on this trip.

We can't buy this thing because our relationship is a mess. We can't go any further until we get that straight. Why?

Because marriage, ultimately, and first of all, is a personal relationship, right? And it's only secondarily a financial or a business or a travel partnership. In the same way, Christianity says, first, first, first, you relationship with God, that's the first issue.

And that's why you never see Christianity almost dealing with any issue of a social issue abstractly. The first thing Paul's going to say to slaves is, well, let's debate whether or not it's right or wrong for you to leave, whether we should start an abolitionist movement. That's not the first thing he says.

The first thing he says is, tomorrow, if you're filled with the spirit, how's that going to affect the way in which you deal with your master? That's why he's doing it that way. He's not condoning slavery here.

He's talking about how slaves are going to live their lives tomorrow. He's immediate. He's practical.

And he's dealing with things from a God-ward relationship point of view. You absolutely have to remember that. And that's really critical.

And by the way, and we'll say one more thing in a minute about slavery and Christianity, one other thing is whatever God says to these people about how to conduct their work life, whatever he says to these people, if it works for them, it probably ought to work for you. You can laugh about being slaves, but you're not. You can laugh at saying, I'm miserable, but you weren't as miserable as these people where I can tell you that.

You can laugh about being poorly paid and never worked, but these people are more poorly paid and more overworked. You can grump about lack of independence. These people had a little less than you do.

If it works for these folks, it should work for you, okay? It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers?

In other words, how can our work connect with God's work? And how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, every good endeavor, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work as you serve God and others.

The book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life.

That's gospelandlife.com-slash-give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

Now one more thing, and that is you can't find a verse actually that tells people that there's nothing, you're not going to find a verse in the Bible that says we need to abandon slavery. Not only that, you don't see a verse in the Bible that says whether or not you should belong to a labor union, you're not going to find a verse that says a lot of things, and here's the reason why, because what the Bible does is it lays down universal principles that apply to everything. If it went after this or that social institution, it would end up with a detailed way.

It's there'd be big sections of the Scripture that we could just say off, that doesn't apply to us. Who got rid of slavery? It was essentially, and I think most people would agree with this, most historians would certainly agree with it.

It was essentially Christians and evangelical Christians. There was a friend of mine who's now passed away, who was a history professor and a student of history at Yale University, and he did his dissertation there on abolitionism in the States. He says, you know, a historian doesn't think the way normal people do.

He says a historian doesn't say, look at the abolition of slavery and say, why did people put up with it that long? How could those people have ever put up with slavery? It's amazing.

It took so long for those people to abolish it. The historian asked the question, since everybody, everywhere, did it. As far back as human beings can ever remember, that the strong enslaved the weak, and the conquerors enslaved the conquered, since everybody had done it from whenever.

Why did it ever get into anybody's mind that it was wrong? He started saying it's very difficult to understand. He says the point is that the people got the idea that it was wrong from the Bible.

In Britain and here, in Britain, there was a man named William Wilberforce, who was a very wealthy person, born in the lap of luxury, who lived in the early 19th century, and who led a life-long battle to get it abolished in the British Empire. Why? Because you see, William Wilberforce didn't necessarily find a verse about slavery one way or the other instead.

He found all the passage. He found the Ten Commandments. He found the golden rule.

Love your neighbor as yourself. Pay people wages. Treat every human being with dignity.

And it's just very easy to see that every human being is an image of God. You don't have the right to own people, to sell people, to kill people, to say who's going to marry who, and so forth, in that sense. And therefore, Christians understood that, and they got rid of it.

And that's the reason why you can say, you know, this passage can do in slavery, actually, it doesn't abolish it. It doesn't condone. It's not talking about that.

How do we know this slavery is wrong, though? Because we know, well, the Bible obviously is a backward-looking document. If the Bible is a backward-looking document, if there is no revelation, you have no way of judging what progress is, no way at all.

It's a crap shoot. The deconstructionists know it. They're saying that.

They're saying all beliefs are social constructions. Basically, there's no right and wrong out. All beliefs come out of, you know, are socially constructed out of your own imagination and basically out of communities.

And if that's true, then which end is up? This end up, we don't know. There's no way of dealing with progress.

The reason I know this slavery is wrong is because the Scripture says so. Because Christianity lays out, you know, in a sense, Paul, even in this passage and other places, if you look carefully, has sown the seed of his destruction. Now the practical, what we've got are several principles, actually two and only two.

Let me tell them to you now and then go back and just elaborate on until we're finished. Let me tell them to you now. There's two false views of work that this passage knocks down.

First false view of work is that work is a curse and that leisure is the meaning of life. And here it tells us that you should be doing work as if it's the will of God and you should be doing it from the heart. The second false view of work, so the first view is that work is a curse and leisure is the meaning of life.

The second false view of work is that work is the meaning of life. And leisure is just something, you know, in other words, the first view says we work in order to really live. And the second view says we live in order to work.

All I do, I just have enough leisure so I could just get back in there just enough so I don't completely kill myself. Leisure is my fulfillment, work is my fulfillment. Now I'm giving it to you in a nutshell, both of these things are very, very dangerous.

If work is a curse and leisure is the meaning of life, if that view of work gets into somebody or gets into a population, gets into a society, what really happens, of course, is what is happening. One quarter of all human, well no, but actually I want to show you that in our culture, both these false views of work are growing extremely fast because of the secularization of our society, because God's out of the picture. If God's out of the picture, either leisure is the meaning of life or work is the meaning of life.

Now if leisure is the meaning of life, and all I do, work is a curse and I don't really care whether I'm getting anything done, whether I'm helping anybody, whether I enjoy what I'm doing, I just need to, I want to get enough dollars so I can really live. Do the things that I want. In a situation like that, productivity goes down, pride in our work goes down, quality of product goes down.

Do you know that today one quarter, studies show one quarter of all American workers are deeply ashamed of what they're producing in the workplace? That's deeply ashamed, okay? Three quarters of all people, three quarters of all people in the workplace say that the quality of the work at this place was better 10 years ago.

That's pretty scary as well. Well, what happens, of course, is to all society when that happens. And the third bad response or the third problem is dishonesty becomes routine when work is a curse.

You don't have pride in your work, you don't see yourself as a servant of anybody, and therefore you're going to cut corners wherever you can. You're going to get whatever you can out of people. You're going to work strictly for the short term and getting the bucks, not for the long term, the good of the economy or the good of community or good of people.

Isn't that right? And so what you have is the great temptation of dishonesty over here on the left. That's an accident that I'm not talking about the left, but on my left hand, it could be on my right, I'm not talking about politics here.

So on the one hand, work is a curse, however I must point out to some degree, it's a bit of a blue collar problem. But because on the other hand, we've got the other problem, that is where as people work in order to live, there's other people who live only to work. Work as self fulfillment, work as the meaning of my life.

Now the problem with this view and the problem that happens here is work, whereas it should be your dignity, it's become your definition. It's the thing that gives you even meaning in life. And of course, the great danger on this side is the danger of workaholism and burnout.

And you see what's interesting is the temptation of dishonesty and the temptation to overwork are both stem from a lack of trust in God. If you are dishonest to try to get more money, you're simply saying, I can't trust God to take care of me. On the other hand, if you are burning yourself out to work, in many cases again, you're saying, I can't really trust God to support and take care of me either.

They both stem from a basically getting God out of the picture. Now let's talk about these two things briefly. And you see, on the one hand, the passage goes against the idea of work as a curse, it says, do your work as the will of God.

It gets rid of the view of work as self fulfillment, you see, because it's saying you're working for God. See, this person over here says, I'm working for the master. I'm just putting my time in.

I'm working, you know, I've got the ball and chain on me, I'm just working for the money. Over here it says, I'm working for myself to fulfill myself, to know that I'm a great person, to know that I really can accomplish something. And the Bible says, if you work for either for money or for yourself, the whole society will go down and you yourself will eventually break apart.

So you have to transform, first of all, your view of work, it's not a curse, it's a calling. And then secondly, you have to transform the aim of your work. It's not a self fulfillment, but a service and stewardship of your gifts to please God.

If you get those two things down, by and large, you're going to find an awful lot of your problems. Not only in society, but in the workplace, we'll work themselves out. Now, I got a couple minutes, so let me go back and try to elaborate each of these a little bit.

On the one hand, work as a curse. So that comes from the classical traditions, it comes from the Greeks and from the Romans. If anybody has read, if you read your Greek mythology close enough, you remember the little story of Pandora?

So this gave Pandora a box, when the world was perfect, there was no problems in the world. And so this gave Pandora a box and says, don't open that box, this is a real sexist myth anyway. We all know that because you know, you give it to a woman, so the woman is to blame.

And at least in the in Genesis, the man and the woman do it together, and then they blame each other. Which we all know is absolutely realistic. But in the Greek myth, it is a sexist myth.

First of all, the woman is the one who's to blame and she's just too curious, she doesn't have self control. She lets her emotions get away with her. That's how the myth goes.

The point I'm trying to make is, when she opens the box, all sorts of things come out. The disease comes out, and death comes out, and hatred also, you know what else comes out? Work.

Completely different approach to the Bible. The Bible tells us that work was there from the beginning, that Adminyve were put into the world to work, and that you were built to work. You were built to get something, to take care of it, to cultivate it, to create.

You're made in the image of God who loves to create. You're made in the image of God who loves to take things and bring the best out of them. And if there was no sin in the world, you still have work.

And in, as far as we know, in heaven, there's going to be work. Because you're built for it, and there can't be a real joy without it. That's totally different than the Greek and Roman notion.

See, the biblical understanding is that we were put here, and then sin happens through the man and the woman together. And all kinds of things come into the world, but work is not one of them. It was already there.

It's not a curse. It's cursed. Work has been cursed, but it's not a curse.

Very important balance, but a very difficult one to maintain. Work is cursed. That's the reason why God says, to Adminyve, you're going to toil in the dust.

And you're going to try to cultivate the earth, and it'll never quite go right. And the thorns will come up. And that means no matter how good you are, and no matter how perfect your work environment is, you're always going to find thorns coming up.

Frustrations. Never able to quite do it. But you cannot jump from that to saying, work is a curse.

The Greek and the Roman idea. In fact, the Latin word for work, negotium, actually means non-leisure. It goes to show their idea was, work is a curse, and the best thing to do is get away from it, especially physical labor.

Contrary to that, the Bible says, the first man was a gardener. And the first man and woman were farmers. And they worked with their hands.

Tremendous dignity given to work. Aristotle and Plato says, if you've got to work, you should never work with your hands. Do art.

And Vincent, what kind of art, right? Some of you get awfully dirty doing your art. I know that.

Do music. Do philosophy. Do politics.

Anyway, the point is, you know, don't get dirty. Do politics. Oh, Aristotle, come on.

The Bible says Adam and Eve worked in the garden. But more than that, the Bible says that work is a calling. Now, what does that mean?

It says so, it doesn't use that word here, though it's implied. It says so in first Corinthians, in several other places. Work is a calling.

A calling means that God has put things in you, given you abilities, and that not that there's one job for you, but that there are a range of jobs that use those abilities and you need to find your abilities so that you can use them as a signpost toward those jobs that you will find that they will be fulfilling. There's a fulfillment there. Do you remember, for example, in Cherokee, it's a fire.

Here you have two guys, Eric Little and Harold Abrams. And they're both working for the prize, and they're reaching for the prize, and they want to be gold medalists in running. They're doing the same thing, the same work and everything.

Two quotes, Eric Little, at one point says to his sister, who's afraid he's not going to go to missionary, to be a missionary in China, and eventually he did, of course, but he says to her, Jenny, you've got to understand, I believe God made me for China, but he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure. See now there's a Christian view of work, too, both, remember I said there's a Christian view of work, it's a calling, and the Christian aim of work, not for money and not for yourself, but for him.

What does he say? First of all, there's the Christian view of work, God made me fast. And here's the Christian aim of work, when I run, I'm pleasing him, I feel his pleasure.

Meanwhile, Harold Abrams says, I've never known contentment, I'm forever in pursuit, and I don't even know what it is I'm chasing. Would you please answer me a very personal question? In your work right now, what is the language of your heart?

Do you say, man, when I do the thing I'm doing, I'm not doing it, but when I do the thing I'm doing with all my might, I think I'm starting to find out who I really am. I'm finding myself. I feel his pleasure, or do you say, I'm working and working and working and working like a dog?

I don't even know what I'm working for, and there's no joy or contentment in it. Which are you closer to? Now, I'll tell you this.

If you're like Harold Abrams, then you have to look at these two things. One is you have to say, am I working only for money? Have I sold my soul for a massive potage?

Is that what I've done? More secondly, am I burning myself out and that gets us to the other thing? Because I'm trying to define myself in terms of my work, which is a more subtle problem and a more difficult problem for Christians to deal with.

If you say, hey, I don't think I'm doing that either, then thirdly, maybe you just haven't really found the place that fits your gifts. You talk to people and find it. Well now, let me just talk briefly about that other side of things.

As I said, the work is a curse, leisure is the meaning of life. You've got to begin to realize you're not going to find yourself that way. You have to say, I am working as a steward of what God's given me, my gifts in the world.

I am to be useful to people. That's what you work for, to be useful to people, to be a steward of the things that God's given you, the world that He's given you, and the gifts that He's given you. That's a calling.

He's called you into that. And no matter who you are, no matter how high or how low, whether you're just a, quote, a gardener or somebody sweeping, you see, as opposed to a philosopher, the biblical understanding is whatever you do with all your might, you are pleasing Him and you are honoring Him. That's why Elizabeth Elliott, you've heard me say this, Elizabeth Elliott says, a clam glorifies God better than you, she would say, why?

Because a clam is doing exactly what it was built to do. It is using its capacities, it's glorifying God by being a clam, it's glorifying God by being a clam, it's perfectly everything God meant it to be. And when it clams, it feels gives pleasure, I'm sure.

But are you being what you were meant to be, are you using your gifts and capacities in that way for Him? Do you see that? Okay, secondly, here's the other problem.

Much more subtle and much more difficult than this we have to close is the other problem. Of work is the meaning of life, you see because you heard me, didn't you hear me? Okay, very close to saying that as you work, you find yourself, yeah.

As you work onto the Lord, you find yourself. There's a place in the Narnia Chronicles where Lucy reads a beautiful story, the most beautiful story she ever, ever, ever heard and as soon as she closed the page, she couldn't remember it. No matter how hard she tried but from that all the time on, for the rest of her life, whenever she heard a good story, she always said, I know that's a good story because it reminds me of the one that I can't quite remember.

It gets me back to that story and when I get into heaven, I'll have the story for real. There's a sense in which when we're doing our jobs well, using the gifts, feeling is pleasure, doing things with all his might, being useful to people, being a good steward of what we've got, there's an almost a sense in which it gets us back in touch with that story of who we're really supposed to be that we won't quite, we can't quite remember where we won't really know until we get there. But on the other hand, work is definition, the perfect example of that was rocky, rocky, sure.

Go for it. What's it? Not money.

Oh no. What's it? If I just go the distance, then I'll know that I'm not a bum.

If I can do my job right, I know I have a self, I know I exist. The way you know that you've moved over from work as dignity to work as being your salvation is you're working yourself into the ground. Now, they say, what about the fact that I'm scared of losing my job?

People are giving me too much to do. You see, there's plenty of people to whom work is a curse, or to whom work is fulfillment of their meaning in life and they're your boss. When that happens, it's mighty difficult for you to just sort of arrange things the way you want.

But look carefully and look really at your motives. What this says is, you must never work for your boss. You must never work for your constituency.

You must never work for the people out there. How was it possible for a slave to get through a day? Paul says the only way a slave is going to get through the day is to look at the master and of course in the heart not out loud say, I'm not working for you.

That's how I deal with it. That's how she dealt with it. I'm not working for you.

I'm working for my master in heaven. I'm going to do the best job with my gifts today. I'm going to be as useful as I possibly can.

I'm not going to worry about how you think or what you feel. I am simply going to do what you ask me to do, but I'm not working for you. And until you're able to do that yourself, you're not going to be able to deal with the pressure.

Hey, you know, as Christian workers have the worst problem of all. Because of course you're working for the Lord, not necessarily at all. I have to every single week.

I've got to look out there and say, I am not working for you. You see because it is not very far to say, I really need for them to come back next week and bring somebody. That's why I'm preaching.

Oh no, oh no. I got as much of a problem with being a slave to you. As you've got a problem being a slave to your worker, these folks have being a slave to their masters.

Now here's the last thing I'll say. You've got to be a Christian to do this. You've got to be a Christian to do this, because unless God is the meaning for your life and unless he's the thing you're living for, you've only got leisure money or self-fulfillment and self-actualization.

You've got nothing else. And both of those things are going to destroy the country, which they are economically and most of all, they'll destroy you, especially if you become that workaholic that I got to live for my work. There was a University of California Berkeley student, not too long ago, that went berserk in class.

Start running around, yelling, they're getting ahead of me. They're getting ahead of me. Sure, he looked down on the gym.

There was people down there who were getting ahead of him in training. There were people in the library reading books he should have been reading. They're getting ahead of him.

The poor guy, down into the ground. Why? Because unless I do a great job, I won't know that I exist.

Everybody's getting ahead of me. What else are you going to live for unless you live for Jesus? You're going to have to live for money.

And that's the most boring thing. I tell you this, I tell you, we're not built for that kind of work and it will kill you. Your life will become like a dust storm that's choking you.

But you're not built to live for work either. That'll just grind you into the ground. You'll never be able to relax.

You'll never be able to say, I'm going home because I'm working for him. I'm not working for you. I'm not working even for me.

I'm working for him. You've got to, by the way, have a personal relationship with him because it says, don't work for them. Don't look at their eyes.

Look at God's eyes. You've got to be a Christian. You've got to have looked them in the eye and you've got to keep looking him in the eye.

When you take your eye off of him, one way the other work will be a curse. It'll be a milestone around your neck and down you'll go. Jenny, he says, I know God made me for China but he also made me fast and when I run, I feel his pleasure.

If you felt the pleasure of working for him, let's pray. Now Father, we thank you that you have shown it so much here. Even though we only had a brief period of time to look at it, I pray now that you would enable us to bring you into every part of our lives so that we can truly be filled with the Spirit and we can truly honor you.

Lord, where else will we go if we don't work for you, if we don't live for you, we'll just be crushed and yet we know, Father, that you would not have shown us this unless you're going to give us your Spirit and give us the power to practice it. So we ask that you'd help us now and we ask that you would help us to practice it and apply it to our lives in the individual ways that we need to by your Spirit's help and your Son's name. Amen.

欢迎来到《福音与生活》。如果你有工作，你很可能经常在想它。但你是否想过圣经对工作的态度呢？今天，在《福音与生活》中，提摩太·基勒将向我们展示，圣经中有非常有帮助和实用的智慧，我们可以将其应用于我们的工作中。

有些观点可能会让你感到惊讶，甚至改变你的生活。请听以弗所书6章。我们将阅读5至9节的内容。关于这个主题，请注意一下。

你们知道，在我们进入以弗所书5章之前，我们有一系列关于婚姻的主题讨论。而在上周，我决定快速地继续探讨两个非常重要的主题，可能不是最鼓舞人心的话题，并非那种每个人听完后都会感叹“太棒了”的讲道。一个话题是父母与子女的关系，上周已经讨论过了。今天我们要讨论的是职场关系，即主人和仆人、雇主和员工之间的关系。

今晚我们将重点讨论这些内容，这也是唯一一次我们专门讨论这个主题的夜晚。虽然这不是最鼓舞人心的话题，但它非常重要，因为当你停下来思考你有多少时间、多少生活都围绕着工作时，你会发现，对于大多数基督徒来说，在他们坐下来试图理解作为基督徒的生活意味着什么的时候——如果有人给你一本书来解释如何成为耶稣的门徒，这里是如何做一个基督徒、如何以基督徒的身份行走。你会发现，如果你仔细阅读，几乎所有那部分内容都在告诉你，作为一个基督徒在晚上和周末应该怎么做。而由于你们中许多人周六工作直到深夜10点才回家，实际上你有很多时间可以作为基督徒。

然而，几乎没有人在教你如何在工作中和工作中成为基督徒。所以我们必须认真看待这个问题。我得说，就像我说过的，这不是鼓舞人心的材料，而是重要的材料，需要你运用所有的智慧去应用。这不会很容易，但你要说，除非我能掌握这一点，否则在我生活的很大一部分中，基督的影响并没有真正体现在我的行为上。

从下周开始，我们将启动一个新的系列，我们会讲到第六章第十节。我只是想让你知道我们要开始另一个系列。基本上这是一个系列中的系列，有几个连接部分，比如我们本周做的这个，但当我们讲到第十节那里说：“最终，在主里面强壮起来，依靠他的大力气，穿上神的全副军装，好在恶者一切诡计面前站立得住；因为我们的争战不是与血肉之躯，乃是与那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这幽暗世界的，以及天空属灵气的恶魔争战。”因此，要穿上神的全副军装。

我们会花很多时间来探讨这段内容。我认为这一段有很多宝贵的教导，实际上是从第六章第十节到第二十节。它讲的是灵界战争，讲的是超自然邪恶，实际上在很大程度上，它是关于基督徒生活的军事意义。这并不意味着基督徒喜欢战争，也不意味着基督徒是海湾战争中的鹰派。

我们谈论的是一种态度——一个绝对现实看待生活本质的人。基督徒不会用玫瑰色的眼镜来看待生活，因为圣经不是一副玫瑰色的眼镜。圣经说，基督徒可以因他在生命中的争战而被人认识，就像他因在生命中的和平而被人认识一样。事实上，基督徒和非基督徒之间的真正区别，并不是说基督徒过着和平的生活而非基督徒则充满冲突。

而是当你成为基督徒后，在你曾有冲突的地方发展出和平，在你本有和平的地方产生冲突。实际上，战斗的战场在变化。基督教绝非如我所说的情感化的东西，它告诉你，这是一个非常艰难、危险的世界。你要时刻准备面对攻击。

你不会像伊丽莎白·埃利奥特曾经说的那样，如果你正在拳击台上，不要跑回角落里对教练说：“那人打到我了。”因为教练会说：“如果你想不被打到，就别上拳台。”成为基督徒意味着你要上拳台。你不能抱怨每天回家都是伤痕累累。

一个基督徒不是说“那人打到我了”，而是说“我要穿上盔甲，做好准备，看看发生了什么”。因此我们会花相当多的时间来讨论基督教是一场战斗。约翰·怀特的一本关于基督徒生活的书非常棒，这是一本逆向压制的书。你们中许多人可能知道它是理解如何过一种基督徒生活最好的书籍之一。

这本书叫《战斗》。他是现实主义的，好吧？但今晚，我会简要地看一下另一个充满斗争的地方，即使不是在外在，至少是在内心。让我们看看以弗所书6章5到9节，并在这个晚上概述一些最基本的原则——神告诉你必须怎样做，才能以基督徒的方式工作和对待你的职业。

> 5 因为我们在这仗的争战里，不是靠武力胜过仇敌； > 6 我们争战的情状，乃是凭着神所赐、那全备的盔甲，使你们能站稳。> 7 所以要拿着神赐的全副军装，好在恶事的日子上能够站立得住，并且能够站得稳，胜过仇敌；因为那隐藏的事，现今显露出来；那本来看不见的事，现在也看得了。> 8 我们所夸的，是十字架的道理，在犹太人为绊脚石，在外邦人为愚拙； > 9 但在那蒙召的，无论是犹太人、希腊人，基督总为神的能力，为神的智慧。让我读一下5到9节的内容，奴隶们，你们中有人会说，这正是我。

要以敬畏的心和诚实的心顺服世上的主人，就像顺服基督一样。不仅是为了博得他们的欢心，而是在他们的眼中工作时也要如此；像基督的仆人那样，按着神的旨意行事，从心里乐意侍奉，好像在为那看不见的主做工，不是为了讨人的喜欢，因为你知道，主必照每个人所行的公平审判。主人也应当用同样的方式对待奴隶们，不要威吓他们，因为你晓得，无论你们是主人还是仆人，都是属天上的主。祂不偏待人。

这就是神的话语，没错吧？一些基本原则，然后是一些实际应用的内容，以及背景介绍，最后是具体的应用。这段经文提出了许多棘手的问题，好在我们不是要将基督教与工作结合起来进行系列讲解，所以我只会轻描淡写地提及这些问题，但它们确实很重要。记住这一点：这表明了基督教是一种全面的生活方式，意味着基督教必须触及你生活的每一个方面；除非你的生活完全重新定向，否则你不能算是一个基督徒。

实际上，这也说明了一个基督徒在任何事情上都与非基督徒不同。哦，基督徒当然会做很多非基督徒也会做的事情，但不一样的是，基督徒不会以同样的方式去做这些事。那么为什么保罗会在生活的各个方面如此详细地阐述呢？如果你从晚上开始读以弗所书，你会发现，在生活的每一个领域，保罗都说，这就是被圣灵充满的意思；这在你的婚姻中意味着什么，这在你的家庭关系中又意味着什么，这在你与父母的关系、工作场所以及社会关系中又有何意义，还有你在文化理解上的意义是什么。

除非一个基督徒在每个方面都以不同的方式行事，否则保罗为何要如此详细地阐述呢？**这意味着基督教不仅仅是一个星期日或晚上的事情。**这是一整天，一生的事。所以保罗说要被圣灵充满时，他指的是生活中每一个领域都要体现出来。

其次，我们真的需要记住，保罗仍然在告诉人们如何被圣灵充满。像我自己这样的长篇大论的讲员，已经好几周了，我都会忘记。当我们在第五章第17节和第18节看到“不要醉酒，要被圣灵充满”，接着他又说，“被圣灵充满”意味着要用诗歌、颂词和心灵的歌彼此交谈，在心里向主歌唱，并对一切感谢神。我这是怎么做到的？

嗯？哦，我们来了。哇，我要小心那个麦克风。那不是我说的，真的。

我没吃晚饭。所以，别担心，我不那么啰嗦。总之，长篇大论。当你讲得太长时，可能会让像我自己这样的牧师有时会让人迷失方向，忘记了保罗仍然在谈论如何被圣灵充满。

因为第五章第21节他说，“彼此顺服”。然后他开始进入生活的各个方面，展示一个被圣灵充满的人是如何与周围人相处的。这至少应该让你明白一点，特别是你们中从那些非常强调被圣灵充满的教会出来的。上星期我们在早上的礼拜中提到过这一点：圣经谈到什么是被圣灵充满时，总是提到了心。

心受圣灵的影响。现在，需要经常强调的一点是，在圣经中，“心”这个词并不像英文中的“心”那样意味着情感。在英文里，“心”通常与头脑相对立。这就是为什么玛丽亚会说：“我的头脑告诉我一件事，但我的心告诉我……我的心告诉我这是我想做的事。

” > 您看，心和脑常常是对立的。在圣经中，“心”是指整个灵魂的所在地。**这意味着您可以用心思考、用心灵意念、用心灵感受。**圣经中有不同的地方提到“人心中的思想”，等等。

心是思维、意志和情感的中心。要看出神的精神真正影响了您，就是您的宗教不只是情绪化的。我们几周前在早上的礼拜中讨论过这一点，它不仅不是情绪化、也不是意志力驱动或仅仅是智力层面的。这里有一个非常重要但往往被忽视的因素。

有些人知道，有些人在开始来这个教会后才经历了转化，尽管他们在之前就已经很虔诚了。现在您是很有意思的一种人，很多时候坐着回想时，会说：“我父母不会相信这一点。”很多人也不会相信，因为我在教会待了很多年，却从未成为基督徒直到来到这里。很多时候，如果您坐下来和他人交谈并思考这个问题，就能发现自己并没有真正理解福音，但有一些迹象表明。

你应该意识到，因为在某些情况下，您的宗教只是理论层面的。**这意味着您在思考圣经、知道很多内容，并且与人争论过，使自己的思维变得清晰。**然而，从未有过对神存在的情感体验，没有激情和温暖，这就是情绪方面的问题。意志上来说，也就是行为上，生活中几乎没有改变。

你不能说：“我比去年更爱别人了，我比去年更有耐心了，我比去年更有智慧了。” 然后有些人说我的生活是自愿的。也就是说，我是一个非常尽责、自律的人，但我的思想却没有成长，自从有了与上帝的真实关系后，我就再也没有改变过。现在很多人可能会觉得，尽管他们热爱崇拜，尽管他们在情感体验上似乎非常强烈，他们会因此认为自己被圣灵充满。

然而当一切归结到根本时，保罗说，如果在生活的各个方面和人际关系中没有持续的进步转变，你就不是被圣灵充满的。被圣灵充满不仅仅是指在崇拜服务中哭泣。当然，它也包括那些情感体验，是的，但它不仅仅是这些。你知道，要被圣灵充满，你就能感受到这一点。

但你可能会认为自己被圣灵充满，并且有强烈的情感体验，除非你在工作中的为人处事、与父母的关系以及其他所有领域都有改变，否则你就不是被圣灵充满的。现在这是这段经文最明显的一点，如果你不退一步思考一下保罗在说什么，就完全会错过这一点。主要的观点是：除非你发现你在工作中的为人处事真的有所改变，否则你就没有被圣灵充满。好吧，还有一个背景因素，一个重要的但不是实用的因素，但它是一个大问题，你不能真正去买它。

事实上，如果我不买它，人们还是会问我这个问题。这段经文是否支持奴隶制？现在你看，福音的两个敌人中，有些人错误地使用了这段经文。一种是不幸的福音反对者，他们认为自己不是反对福音的人，他们是教会里的牧师，他们用这段经文来说，是的，奴隶制是可以接受的。

如果要回到1850年代和1860年代，你会发现当时美国的牧师们，尤其是在南部地区，会根据这段经文来为奴隶制度辩护。他们说：“你看，对奴隶怎么说？它没有说逃跑吧？而是说要为主人服务。

” 它说你们应该怎么做，你明白吗？于是就有了这种解释。另一方面，也有一些人错误地引用了这段经文。有人认为，“看，圣经是允许奴隶制的。

” 这表明圣经虽然在很多方面是一本好书，但本质上只是一部过时的书，一本道德落后的书。这是一种不值得信赖的文字。因此，圣经中有许多好的东西，但也有一些内容真的不好。有些内容是过时的、错误的，是我们必须拒绝的，甚至是不道德的。

它支持种族主义、阶级主义、奴隶制等等。这两种观点都不对，尤其是后者，这种说法是不合逻辑的，因为圣经明文谴责了奴隶制。既然我们知道奴隶制是错的，那么从这一点来看，圣经在道德上确实显得低劣。朋友们，圣经声称自己是上帝的启示。

如果上帝已经说话，并且向我们揭示什么是正确、什么是错误，那么我们就真的可以有绝对的道德原则来告诉每一个人：无论你认为什么是对的或错的，**这是对的，这是错的。这是一种普遍的绝对真理**，就像重力定律一样，我们必须相信它。但如果没有任何启示，如果上帝没有告诉我们什么是正确和错误的话，那么所有的道德都是主观意见。所有道德都是主观意见。

我很好奇你们凭什么制定出这么高的道德标准来评判圣经呢？这个标准从何而来？你看，如果没有启示，那一切都是主观意见。你可能有自己的观点，但没有办法认为它低劣。

你明白这一点了吗？没有一个基础来说它是低劣的。现在，我知道奴隶制是错误的，而且你们也应该知道这一点的原因，是因为我们相信圣经的启示。首先，关于这段有关奴隶制的文字，有两件事需要明确。

第一，当然，它并没有在这里说奴隶应该逃跑。你必须记住，再次强调一下背景，这个背景是：什么是被圣灵充满的意思？这将如何影响你明天以及每一个关系？从某种意义上讲，圣经从来不会抽象地讨论社会问题；它总是从“这个问题与你的神的关系有何关联？

”的角度来探讨。没错，两周前我们已经提到过这一点。在今天的晨祷中，我将会再次强调这一点。圣经实际上并不会直接谈论大多数问题，除非你先决定对耶稣的看法。

换句话说，在某种程度上，它甚至不会让你触及其他问题。人们会说：“我对成为基督徒感兴趣，但我不知道自己对进化论的看法。” 或者他们会说：“我对基督教感兴趣，并且可能对基督感兴趣，但我不明白‘以德报怨’是什么意思。” 或者他们喜欢很多事情，但担心如果成为基督徒，这可能会改变他们的政治立场，无论朝哪个方向。

甚至有人会说：“我喜欢基督教，但我首先要弄清楚在生活中的某个领域我需要做什么。” 从某种意义上讲，新约圣经表示不会回答这些问题。新约的作者们也不会回答这些问题。首先，你对耶稣的看法是什么？

他们之所以这样做，是因为他们认为如果基督教本质上是一种思想体系，那么你可以在遇见他之前就解决你的哲学问题。> 也就是说，新约圣经不会直接回答那些问题，而是先问：“你对祂的看法是什么？” 但如果基督教本质上是一种关系，一种个人的关系，那么你必须弄清楚你如何看待他，他的自我描述是否真实，以及你是否会接受或拒绝他。否则，新约中的一切就都没有意义了。

说我不确定耶稣是不是神，但我想知道圣经上关于奴隶制怎么说，这真是荒谬。关键在于，如果耶稣不是神，那我们为什么在乎圣经上关于奴隶制怎么说？如果耶稣不是神，那我们为什么在乎任何人的看法？这一切都只是个人意见的问题。

另一方面，如果耶稣是神，那么我们可以对话。一旦你理解这一点，接受他，并将他引入你的生活，你会发现他所说的一切都会变得有意义，但在此之前却不会。明白了吗？婚姻是一个复杂的概念，正如你们所知道的那样，所以我们花了九周的时间来讨论它。

其中有很多方面。在婚姻中有很多事情要做，很多问题要解决，很多业务要处理，但偶尔，一个人会突然停下来，说我们不能继续做任何其他事情了，因为我们的关系出了问题。我们不能做出这个决定，不能去那个旅行，不能买那件东西，因为我们之间的关系一团糟。为什么呢？

因为婚姻最终和首要的是个人的关系，对吧？而它只是其次才是财务、商业或旅行伙伴关系。同样地，基督教说，首先，最重要的是你与神的关系。这也是为什么你几乎看不到基督教在处理任何社会问题时是抽象的。

保罗对奴隶的第一件事不会是讨论你是否应该离开，或者我们是否应该发起废奴运动。他首先会说的是…… 第一个他说的是，明天如果你被圣灵充满，那会怎么影响你对待主人的方式？所以他这么做是有原因的，并不是在为奴隶制辩护。他是在讨论明天奴隶们将如何生活。

他是直接的，是实际的。而且他从一个上帝关系的角度来处理这些问题。这一点绝对要记住。这是非常关键的。

顺便说一句，在一会儿我们还会再谈谈基督教与奴隶制的关系，还有一个要点是：无论神对这些人说了什么关于工作生活的指导，如果对他们有效，对你也应该有效。你可以嘲笑自己是奴隶，但你不是；你可以抱怨自己很痛苦，但你们这些人的痛苦远不及那些人——我可以告诉你。你可以嘲笑自己的薪水低和无所事事，但那些人的工资更低、工作更辛苦。你可以抱怨缺乏独立性，但他们比你还少一点。

如果对他们有效，对你也应该有效，对吧？据估计，我们大多数人每天有半数清醒时间都在工作。圣经中的智慧如何应用到我们的职业生涯中？换句话说，我们的工作如何与神的工作相连接？

我们的职业如何更加充满情感？在他的书《每项事业》中，提摩西·凯勒从几十年的职业和呼召教学经验出发，向你展示了如何在服侍上帝和他人中找到工作的真正喜悦。这本书提供了关于基督教视角下的工作如何成为蓬勃事业和个人生活的基础的惊人见解。《每项事业》是我们对帮助福音与生命在全球范围内分享基督之爱的礼物表示感谢的方式，请访问gospelandlife.com-slash-give。

那就是gospelandlife.com-slash-give。现在，让我们听听凯勒博士今天的余下部分教导。再来一件事，就是你找不到一节经文明确告诉人们说没有奴隶制是不行的。圣经中也没有一节经文说我们要放弃奴隶制。

不仅如此，在圣经中也找不到一节经文说是否应该加入劳工组织，更不用说很多其他的事情了。原因在于，圣经确立的是普世原则，适用于一切事物。如果它针对某个特定的社会机构进行讨论，最终只会导致详细的规则。会有大段的圣经内容我们可以说不适用。

谁废除了奴隶制？基本上，我认为大多数人都会同意这一点，绝大多数历史学家也会认同这一点。基本上是基督徒和福音派基督徒推动了这一进程。我有一个已故的朋友，他是一位历史教授，在耶鲁大学攻读历史学，并在那里完成了关于美国废奴运动的博士论文。

他说，一个历史学家不会像普通人那样思考问题。他说，历史学家不会问：“为什么人们要忍受奴隶制那么久？”“那些人怎么可能容忍奴隶制？”这真是不可思议。

奴隶制被废除花了这么长时间。历史学家会提出这样一个问题：既然人类从古至今都这样做，为什么有人会认为这是错误的？他开始说这很难理解。他说，关键在于人们是从圣经中得到了这种观念的。

在英国，在这里，在英国有一位名叫威廉·威伯福斯的人，他出身于富裕家庭，生活在19世纪初，并且一生致力于废除大英帝国的奴隶制。为什么？因为威廉·威伯福斯并没有找到一节经文明确支持或反对奴隶制。他找到了整段经文。

他找到了十诫。他找到了黄金法则。爱人如己。付给人工钱。

对待每一个人要有尊严。很容易看出，每一个人都代表神的形象。你没有权利拥有别人、出卖别人、杀死别人，或者决定谁该和谁结婚等等。因此，基督徒明白这一点，并废除了这些行为。

所以你可以这样说：这段经文实际上并没有废除奴隶制，也没有纵容它，更不是在谈论这个话题。那么我们怎么知道这种奴隶制是错误的呢？因为很明显，《圣经》是一部后退看的文件。如果《圣经》是一部后退看的文件，如果没有启示，你就没有任何方法来判断进步是什么，根本没有任何办法。

这就像掷硬币一样。解构主义者也这么认为。他们说所有的信念都是社会建构出来的。基本上，没有对与错。

所有信念都来源于你自己的想象和社区。如果这是真的，那么哪一端是正确的？这一端还是那一端？我们都不知道。

没有办法处理进步的问题。我知道这种奴隶制是错误的，是因为《圣经》这样说。因为基督教明确指出，在某种意义上，保罗在这段经文和其他地方已经播下了他自身的毁灭之种。现在我们有几条原则，实际上只有两条。

我现在就告诉你这两条原则，然后再详细解释一下直到结束。我现在就告诉你这两条原则。这段经文推翻了两种错误的关于工作的观点。第一种错误的观点是工作是一种诅咒，闲暇才是生活的意义。

这里告诉我们应该像遵行神的心意一样去做工，并且要出于真心地去做。第二种错误的观点是工作是一种诅咒，而闲暇才是生活的意义。工作生活的第二个错误观点是，工作就是生活的意义。而休闲只是其他东西，换句话说，第一个观点认为我们是为了真正生活才去工作；第二个观点则认为我们为了工作而生活。

我所做的所有事情，只是为了有足够的休闲时间让我能够重新回到工作中，不至于完全耗尽自己。休闲是我的满足感，工作也是我的满足感。现在我把这些都浓缩给你们了，这两种观念都非常危险。如果认为工作是诅咒，而休闲才是生活的意义，那么这种对工作的看法一旦进入某个人或某个群体，甚至整个社会，实际上发生的情况就是我们现在所看到的。

在我们的文化中，这两种错误的工作观正在以惊人的速度增长，这主要是因为社会的世俗化，上帝已经从我们的生活中消失了。如果上帝不在场，要么休闲是生活的意义，要么工作是生活的意义。如果认为休闲才是生活的意义，而工作只是诅咒，那么我所做的所有事情都不再关心是否能完成任务、帮助他人或享受自己的工作，我只需要赚足够的钱来真正生活并做我想做的事情。在这种情况下，生产率下降，对工作的自豪感也会下降，产品质量也会降低。

你知道吗？今天研究表明，美国四分之一的工人对自己的工作中所产出的东西感到深深的羞愧。这是深深羞愧的意思。而在职场上，有四分之三的人认为这里的质量工作比十年前要差很多。

这确实是非常可怕的情况。当然，当这种情况发生时，对整个社会的影响也是巨大的。第三个不良反应或问题就是，当工作成为诅咒时，欺骗行为会变得司空见惯。你不因自己的工作而骄傲，也不把自己看作是任何人的仆人，因此你会在任何地方偷工减料。

你只会从别人那里榨取利益，只为短期利益和赚钱，而不是为了经济、社区或人们的长远福祉。这难道不是这样吗？所以这里左边的诱惑就是不诚实。虽然我不是指政治上的左派，但这个比喻可以适用于任何方向的手边。

一方面，工作是种诅咒；然而我必须指出，在某种程度上，这是一个蓝领问题。另一方面，我们还有另一种问题：人们为了生存而工作，却有人只是为了工作而生活。工作成了自我实现，成了生命的意义。这种观点的问题在于，本应赋予你尊严的工作，现在变成了你的定义，甚至是你生活的意义所在。

而在这边的危险是工作狂和身心俱疲。有趣的是，不诚实的诱惑和过度工作的诱惑都源自对上帝的信任缺失。如果你不诚实只是为了多赚钱，那你就认为自己无法信任上帝来照顾你。另一方面，如果你拼命工作直到身心俱疲，很多时候也是因为你认为上帝不会支持或照顾你。

这两种情况都是把上帝排除在生活之外。现在让我们简要谈谈这两点。一方面，经文反对将工作视为诅咒，它说：“你们做工当照着主的旨意去做。” 它摒弃了以自我实现为工作意义的观点，因为它是说你在为上帝工作。

你看，那边的人说：“我在为主人工作，只是在尽我的职责。” 我在工作，你知道，我身上带着锁链，只是为了赚钱。这里说：我要为自己而工作，为了实现自我，为了知道自己是一个伟大的人，知道自己真的能做成一些事情。圣经上也说，如果你为钱或自己工作，整个社会都会垮掉，你自己也会分崩离析。

所以首先，你必须改变对工作的看法，它不是一种诅咒，而是一种召唤。其次，你必须改变工作的目标，不是为了自我实现，而是要用你的恩赐服侍上帝、管理好自己的事工。如果你做到了这两点，很大程度上你会发现自己很多问题都会迎刃而解。不仅在社会层面，在工作中也会自己解决。

现在我还有几分钟时间，让我再详细解释一下这两点。一方面，工作是一种诅咒。这源自古典传统，来自希腊和罗马的神话。如果你读过希腊神话，记得那个潘多拉的故事吗？

神给了潘多拉一个盒子，当世界完美时，世界上没有问题。于是给了她这个盒子，并说不要打开它，这是一个很具性别歧视意味的神话。我们知道这是因为你把东西给女人了，所以女人要承担责任。而在《创世记》中，男人和女人一起犯了错误，然后互相指责。

这我们都知道是完全现实的。但在希腊神话里，这是一个性别歧视的故事。首先，女人要负责任，她太好奇，缺乏自制力，让情绪控制了自己。这就是故事的情节。

我想要表达的是，当她打开盒子时，各种事情都出来了。疾病、死亡和仇恨都出来了，你知道还有什么也出来了？工作。> 你读过希腊神话吗？

潘多拉得到了一个盒子，里面装满了人类的苦难。当她好奇地打开了盒子，所有的罪恶——包括工作——都涌了出来。完全不同的圣经观。圣经告诉我们，工作从一开始就有，人类被造就是为了工作，而且你们也被造来工作。

你们是为工作而造的，是为了获得、照顾、耕种和创造。你们按照那位喜爱创造的神的形象被造。你们也按照那位喜爱改进事物并使其变得最好的神的形象被造。即使没有罪，你们仍然需要工作。

据我们所知，在天堂里也会有工作。因为你们是为工作而造的，没有工作就无法获得**真正的快乐。这与希腊和罗马的观点完全不同。看啊，圣经的理解是**，人类被创造出来之后，才发生了罪的问题。

各种各样的事情随之而来，但工作并不是其中之一。它从一开始就存在了。工作不是诅咒，而是被诅咒了。工作被诅咒了，但这并不意味着工作本身是一种诅咒。

这是一个非常重要的平衡，但却很难维持。工作是被诅咒的，因此神对人类说：“你要在尘土中劳碌。”你们要耕种土地，但永远无法完全成功；刺藤会生长出来。**这意味着无论你多么出色，无论你的工作环境多么完美，你总会遇到刺藤。**

挫折感。永远无法完全做好。但这不意味着工作本身就是一种诅咒。希腊和罗马的观点恰恰相反。

事实上，“negotium”这个词在拉丁语中意为“非闲暇”，这表明他们认为工作是一种诅咒，最好的做法是尽量避开它，尤其是体力劳动。与此相反，圣经说，第一个男人是一个园丁，而第一个男人和女人都是农民，他们用手工作。圣经赋予了工作的巨大尊严。亚里士多德和柏拉图曾说过，如果你不得不工作，就不要用双手工作，去做艺术吧。

你们中有些人做艺术时会弄得非常脏，我了解这一点。去做音乐、哲学或政治。总之，就是不要弄脏手，去做政治。哦，亚里士多德，你真会说笑。

圣经说亚当和夏娃在园子里工作。但不仅如此，圣经还说工作是一种呼召。那么这又意味着什么呢？虽然这里没有用这个词，但在哥林多前书和其他一些地方已经暗示了这一点。

工作就是一种呼召。所谓呼召，是指上帝赋予你能力，并不是只有一份适合你的工作，而是有许多种不同的工作可以发挥这些能力。你需要找到自己的能力所在，以便在工作中作为标志指引你走向那些能够让你感到满足的工作。有一种满足感在里面。

比如，在切罗基（Cherokee）这里，它是一种火。这里有两个人，埃里克·利特尔和哈罗德·阿布斯。他们都在为奖牌而努力，都想要成为跑步项目的金牌得主。他们在做同样的事情，同样的工作。

两个引用：埃里克·利特尔曾对他的妹妹说，她担心他可能不会成为一名去中国的传教士，但最终他确实去了中国。他对她说：“你必须明白，我相信上帝让我为中国的使命而生，但我也被赋予了速度的能力。当我跑步时，我感受到祂的喜悦。” 现在这也是一种基督徒的工作观：一种呼召，记得我说过有一种基督徒的工作观，那就是工作是为了上帝，而不是为了钱或你自己。

他怎么说呢？首先，这是一种基督徒的工作观——上帝让我拥有速度。而这里也是一种基督徒工作的目标——当我跑步时，我是在取悦祂，我能感受到祂的喜悦。与此同时，哈罗德·阿布斯说：“我从未有过满足感，我一直在追求，甚至不知道我在追逐什么。

” 请回答一个非常个人的问题：在你目前的工作中，你的内心语言是什么？你会说：“当我做我现在做的事情时，并不是真的在做，但当我用尽全力去做这件事时，我觉得自己开始找到了真实的自我。我感受到了祂的喜悦。” 还是会说：“我在拼命工作，像条狗一样？

” 我不知道自己在追求什么，也没有从中得到快乐和满足。你是更接近前者呢？现在，我要告诉你。如果你像哈罗德·阿布斯那样，你必须看看这两件事。

首先，你要问自己：我是否只是为了钱而工作？我已经为了巨额财富出卖了我的灵魂吗？这是不是我在做的事情？其次，你在拼命工作，这带我们到了另一个问题上，因为我试图通过我的工作来定义自我，这是一个更微妙的问题，也是基督徒需要面对的更难解决的问题。

如果你说，嘿，我觉得我也没有这样做，那么第三点可能是你还没有找到适合发挥自己才能的地方。你可以和别人交流，找到那个地方。现在，让我简要谈谈另一个方面的事情。正如我说过的，工作是诅咒，休闲才是生活的意义。

你必须开始意识到，你不会通过这种方式找到自我。你需要说：我是在管理上帝赐予我的礼物，在世界上发挥作用。你要为他人有用而工作，这是你的追求，是作为上帝所赐的才能、世界和恩赐的管家而工作。这是一项呼召。

祂已经把你召唤进这项工作中了。无论你是谁，无论你地位高低，无论是园丁还是清扫工，而不是哲学家，圣经的理解是：只要你全力以赴地做每一件事，你就是在荣耀祂，你在尊敬祂。这就是为什么伊丽莎白·埃利奥特说过这样的话：她说牡蛎比你还荣耀上帝，你知道为什么吗？因为牡蛎正在做它被创造来做的事情。

它在使用它的能力，通过成为牡蛎而荣耀上帝，通过成为牡蛎而荣耀上帝，它是上帝想要它成为的完美状态。当它成为牡蛎时，它感到快乐，我敢肯定。但你是否成为了你本该成为的样子，你是否用你的才能和能力为祂服务？你能看到这一点吗？

好的，第二个问题来了。比这个更微妙、更难解决的问题还有很多。生活的意义，你明白吗？你看我刚才说了没有，你们听清楚了吗？

没错，就是说你在工作中找到自我。当你向主做工时，你会找到真正的自我。在纳尼亚传奇中，露西读了一个非常美丽的故事——她有史以来听过最美丽的故事之一。但当她合上书页后，却怎么也记不起来了，无论她多么努力。

然而从那一刻起，直到她余生的每一天，每当听到一个好的故事时，她总会说：“我知道这是一个好故事，因为它让我想起了那个我无法完全记住的故事。” 这让我回到了那个故事，在天堂里我会真正拥有这个故事。当我们做好工作，使用我们的恩赐，感到快乐，全力以赴地做事，对他人有用，善用我们所拥有的时候，有一种感觉让我们重新与**真正的自我相连——那种自我是**我们记不起来的，直到到达那里才会知道。但另一方面，工作就是定义。

罗克·罗克的例子是最好的证明。去做吧！那是什么？不是金钱。

不，不是。那是什么？如果我能坚持到最后，我知道我不是一个失败者。如果我做好我的工作，我知道我有自我，我知道我存在。

你之所以能从工作中找到尊严而不是救赎，是因为你在拼命地工作。现在他们说，可是我害怕失去工作怎么办？人们给我太多的工作要做。你看，有很多人把工作当作诅咒，或者认为工作是生命的意义所在，而这些人就是你的老板。

当这种情况发生时，你很难按照自己的意愿来安排事情。但仔细观察并真正审视一下你的动机。这告诉我们，你绝不能为了老板工作，绝不能为了利益群体工作。你绝不能为外面的人做工。

奴隶怎么才能熬过一天呢？保罗说，奴隶若想熬过一天，唯一的方法就是看着主人，并且当然在心里而不是嘴里说：我不是为你做工。这就是我处理这件事的方式。这也是她处理的方式。

我不是为你做工。我是为主在我天上的主人做工。今天我要用我的恩赐尽最大的努力工作。我要尽可能地有用。

我不在乎你怎样想或感觉如何，我只是会照你的吩咐去做事，但我是为主做工。直到你自己也能做到这一点，你才能应对压力。嘿，你知道吗，作为基督徒的工人，你们面临的问题是最糟糕的。因为你们确实是为主做工，而不是一定为你做工。

我每周都得这样做。我必须看着外面说：我不是为你做工。你看，说出这句话并不远：他们下周回来带人就好了。这就是我布道的原因。

哦不，哦不。我对成为你的奴隶和你对我的员工成为奴隶一样有困扰。这些人都在为他们的主人成为奴隶。最后我要说的是，你们必须是基督徒才能做到这一点。

因为除非上帝是你生命的意义所在，除非他是你活着追求的目标，否则你只有休闲的钱财或自我实现与自我完善。除此之外你就什么都没有了。而这两者都会毁掉国家——经济上如此，更重要的是会毁掉你自己，尤其是当你成为那种工作狂时，我必须为了我的工作而活。不久之前，有一名加州大学伯克利分校的学生在课堂上发疯了。

他在教室里跑来跑去，喊着：他们超过了我！他们超过了我！当然，他看向体育馆。那里有人在他训练方面超过了他。

图书馆里有人都在读他应该读的书。他们在超过他。> 你必须为主做工，而不是为别人。只有这样，你才能真正地释放压力和自由。

可怜的人，埋在土里。为什么？因为除非我做得很好，否则我不知道自己存在。每个人都比我快一步。

除了为耶稣活着，你还活着为了什么？你只能为了钱。那真是最无聊的事了。我要告诉你，我们不是为此类工作而造的，它会让你丧命。

你的生活会变成一个让你窒息的尘暴。但你也无法为工作而活。那样只会把你压垮，你永远无法放松。你永远不能说：“我回家了，因为我为他工作。

”我不是为你工作的。甚至也不是为了我自己。我是为他工作的。顺便提一句，你需要与他建立个人关系，因为圣经上说：不要为他们工作，不要看他们的脸。

要看上帝的脸。你必须是基督徒，你必须直视他的眼睛，并且要一直看着他。当你把目光从他身上移开时，无论朝哪个方向，工作都会变成诅咒。它会像一条项圈套在你的脖子上，把你拉下深渊。

珍妮说：我知道神让我来到中国，但他也赐给我速度，在奔跑中我能感受到他的喜悦。如果你能感受到为他工作的快乐，请让我们祷告。现在父啊，我们感谢你在这里向我们展示了这一切。尽管我们只有短暂的时间来审视它，但愿你现在能够帮助我们在生活的每一个角落引入你，使我们真正被圣灵充满，并真正荣耀你。

主啊，如果我们不为你工作，不为你活着，我们将被压垮。但我们知道，父啊，你既然向我们显明了这一切，就一定会赐给我们你的圣灵和实践它的能力。所以现在求你帮助我们，也求你帮助我们在需要的方式上实践它，并通过圣灵的帮助和你儿子的名应用到我们的生活中。阿门。
