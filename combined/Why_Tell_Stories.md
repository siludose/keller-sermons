## 故事的力量 / The Power of Stories

They're not totally random because they're kind of, they're sort of logical but some ideas about what stories are and why they have the impact they have. First of all, what's the story? You might find this odd.

The best place I've ever read a definition of a story is in the Harvard Business Review. A two or three Hollywood screenwriters wrote an article because the Harvard Business Review was saying it CEOs when they're trying to persuade people stupidly, use graphs and figures and they just give you facts and figures. He says that's not what changes people's minds.

That's not what motivates people. You need to tell a story. And they have no idea what about stories in MBA school.

So they said here's what a story is. Three things. First of all, well, it's actually two things in a way.

Something knocks life off balance. You do not have a story unless something has knocked life out of whack. So you know, the classic is Lillard Riding Hood took her grandmother goodies is a principal.

It's a fact. You know, it's a graph. It's not a story.

But Lillard Riding Hood went to take her grandmother goodies, but the big bad wolf had eaten her grandmother and was waiting for her in bed. That's a story. Something is, you know, knocked life out of whack.

Then because something is knocked life out of whack, you have, and there's been a lot of ink spilled about this for years now, you have protagonist and antagonist. A protagonist means a pro-agonizer. You're agonizing for something.

And the antagonist is the anti-agonizer. And the protagonist is trying to get life back in balance. And the antagonists are the people who are against you or the forces that are against you that are trying to stop you from do that.

You don't have a story unless you have protagonist and antagonist. And when I said there's been a lot of ink spilled over the years about this, I'm going to tell you in a minute that almost everybody from liberal to conservative realizes that the reason stories are so powerful is that there's no way for a human being to attach meaning to anything unless you put it into a storyline. And there's no such thing as a storyline without something being knocked off balance, and some people struggling to put it back in balance, and some people against them, right?

You don't have a story unless you've got good guys and bad guys, or at least of some sort. And the reason people are pretty upset about that is if you can't attach meaning to something without a story, and if story is got always protagonists and antagonists, there's no way to attach meaning to anything without basically dividing the world into good guys and bad guys. And every master story that helps you organize reality has to have, quote, the other capital O.

Somebody that we see is the bad guy. And that is one of the problems we have in the world right now. And you can ask me more about if you want.

So a story is something knocks life off a balance. Protagonists try to get it back in balance against the eye tag, and I guess the third thing you would say is the resolution of the story is is the mission success or not. Stories don't have to have happy endings.

You know, they can have ambiguous endings, they can have like no endings, which of course is really cool and avant garde, you know, not to end it. But the point of the matter is even if that you don't end the story, if you don't end it happily, you know the story should end, or you know the story hasn't ended. Because you know that stories have endings.

And so maybe the story, maybe the play, maybe the movie doesn't really tell you how it ends, but you know there should be an end. That's what a story is. Now, I already said this.

That's the first thing. That's what a story is. Secondly, I already alluded to this.

但我会先告诉你一些关于故事的基本概念和它们为何有如此大的影响力。首先，什么是故事？你可能会觉得奇怪。我在哈佛商业评论中读到过对“故事”最精辟的定义。

两位或三位好莱坞编剧写了一篇文章，因为哈佛商业评论认为CEO们试图说服别人时，愚蠢地使用图表、数据，只是给出事实和数字，并不能改变人们的想法。他说那不是真正能打动人心的东西。你必须讲故事。而MBA学校的学生对此一无所知。

所以他们解释说，这就是故事：三个要点。首先，实际上有两个要点。生活中发生了什么打破平衡的事情。除非有某件事打破了生活的常态，否则你没有故事。

比如经典的《小红帽》，她带着礼物去看奶奶——这是一个事实，一个图表，不是故事。但是，《小红帽》的故事是这样的：她去给奶奶送礼物，但大灰狼已经吃掉了奶奶，并且在床铺上等着她。这就是个故事。生活中发生了打破平衡的事情。

然后因为生活被打乱了，你有了主人公和反派。主人公的意思就是积极行动的人。你在为某事而努力。反派是正派的对立面。

正派试图让生活恢复平衡，而反派则是那些反对你的人或阻碍你实现目标的力量。没有正派和反派就没有故事。我说过这些年关于这个话题已经有很多讨论了，接下来我会告诉你，从自由派到保守派几乎所有人都意识到，故事之所以如此强大，是因为人类无法赋予任何事物意义除非将其置于一个故事情节中。而没有打破平衡的故事线是不存在的，总有人试图恢复平衡，也总有反对他们的人。

没有好人和坏人的故事是不存在的，人们对此感到不满的原因在于，如果不能通过故事来赋予事物意义，而故事总是围绕着正派和反派展开，那么就无法将任何东西归类为好或坏。每一个帮助你组织现实的故事都必须有“另一方”，即一个我们视作坏人的角色。这也是我们现在面临的一个问题。故事是打破生活平衡的事物。

正派试图恢复平衡，而反派则在对抗他们。第三点，故事的结局是否成功也是其重要组成部分。故事不一定非要有一个快乐的结尾。你知道，有些故事可以有模糊不清的结局，甚至没有明确的结局，这当然很酷也很前卫，不给故事一个结局。

但关键在于，即使你没有给故事一个完美的结局，你也知道它应该有个结局。这就是故事的本质。我已经说过这一点了。这是第一点，这就是故事的定义。

## 故事即世界观 / Stories as Worldviews

You cannot attach meaning to anything unless you put it in a storyline. Now my best examples of this, my favorite example, this is 9-11. There's a liberal storyline.

And the liberal storyline is America are the bad people in the world, and the oppressed in the poor are the good. And there's a conservative storyline, which is America are the good people. We believe in democracy and we're good people.

And out there is all sorts of totalitarianism and all sorts of, you know, low IQ and all sorts of other people. And so we're the good guys and they're the bad guys as opposed to liberal. And so what happened when 9-11 comes along?

What do they do? Some people said, you see, they hate us because we are so big and so bad. Conservative said, see, they hate us because we're so good.

And now we have to do something about it. In other words, what they immediately did was they said, what this means is we got to do a war on terror. The liberal said what this means is we've got to, you know, admit what we're doing in the world and how people hate us and so on.

They took the incident and they couldn't make sense of it unless they brought it into a storyline. Now the best storyline was actually Giuliani and Pataki. And what they said was this tragedy can make us a stronger city.

If we pull together, we can do it. We can do it. So what they did was they, you know, they put it in a different storyline.

But nobody could talk about it without putting it into a storyline. Nobody could just give you facts. You can't make sense of anything.

You can't attach meaning to anything unless you put it into a narrative. You watch newspapers, look at plays, everybody's got the assumption behind every story is life ought to be in a certain way. Something has knocked it off balance.

And these are the people trying to put it into balance and these are the people who are against it. Now first of all, that means you can't attach meaning to your own life unless you have a master storyline. There's some people who say my master storyline is I am bringing myself out of very, very humble roots and abusive background.

And I'm going to make something of myself. That's their storyline. Other people, it's a quest for true love.

There's no doubt about it. That's their storyline. Other people, I'm a free spirit artist and I'm trying to make the world safe for free spirit artists like me.

And, you know, it's the oppressive, traditional people that really is why the world is bad. Everybody's got a narrative by which they are saying, this is what my life means. And, and this would be in the book, if any of you read that book that I'd recommend it to Luan.

What that book says is everybody has a worldview, which is you can't operate without a kind of macro story view of what the world story is. In other words, when you look out in the world, obviously the world's not what it ought to be. Something is knocked the world off whack.

Poverty isn't a good thing. War isn't a good thing. Races isn't a good thing.

You know, psychological problems are a good thing. What is wrong with the world? And we'll put it right.

So, Marx had an idea. He kind of vilified, you know, the in a bourgeois and he vilified the, you know, the owners of the means of production. And he said, basically, state control of economy will make the difference.

Freud had an approach. Everybody's got an approach. Buddhist say, the real problem is individual consciousness.

You think you're an individual self and you don't see your part of the old soul. See, Plato and the Greeks, they said the real problem is the material world and the way it drags you down. Everybody says, this here is the villain.

This is the antagonist. This is what's wrong. And here's what you have to do to put it right.

Everybody's got that. And they're called worldviews. No matter who you are, you can't live without one.

But a worldview is actually just a master narrative of what you think is wrong with the world, who's on the right side to get it back, who's on the wrong side, who's against getting it back, and what do we have to do? Now, what this means for Christians is this.

第二点，我已经提到了这一点。你不能给任何事物赋予意义，除非把它放在一个故事框架里。我最喜欢的例子就是9-11事件，这里有两个不同的叙述方式：一个是自由派的故事线，认为美国是世界上作恶多端的人；而保守派则认为美国是好人，相信民主和正义。在他们看来，外面的世界充满了专制和低智商的人。

因此，我们是好人，他们是坏人。当9-11事件发生时，发生了什么？有人说是这样的：他们恨我们是因为我们太强大了。保守派则说：他们恨我们是因为我们太好了。

于是，我们必须采取行动。换句话说，他们立刻把这归结为一场反恐战争。自由派则认为**这意味着**我们需要承认我们在世界上的行为，并且认识到人们为什么恨我们。****他们将事件放入一个故事框架中才能理解其意义。

而最好的故事线是吉尔根尼和帕塔基提出的：这场悲剧可以让我们变得更强大，如果我们团结起来，我们可以做到。于是，他们把事情放在了不同的叙述框架里。但没有人能单纯地谈论这些而不将其置于某个故事框架内。你不能仅靠事实来理解任何事物。

除非将它放入一个叙事中，否则你无法给任何事物赋予意义。你看报纸、看戏剧，每个人背后都有一个假设：生活应该是一种特定的方式，而某些事情已经打破了这种平衡。这些人试图重新调整这种平衡，而另一些人则反对这样做。首先，**这意味着你不能给自己的一生赋予意义，除非有一个主导的故事线。**

有些人说他们的主导故事线是他们从非常卑微的背景和虐待中走出来。我会成就一番事业。这就是他们的故事线。其他人则在追求真爱。

毫无疑问，这就是他们的故事线。其他人则是自由精神的艺术家，试图让世界变得更适合像他们这样的自由精神艺术家生存。你知道，是那些压迫性的传统人们让这个世界变得糟糕。每个人都有一个关于自己生活的叙述，认为这就是生命的意义。

如果你读过我推荐给路安的那本书的话，书里会这么说。那本书说，每个人都有一种世界观，也就是说，在没有一种宏观的世界观来解释世界故事之前，你是无法行动的。换句话说，当你放眼这个世界时，显然世界并不是它应有的样子。有些东西已经把世界搞乱了。

贫穷不是好事。战争不是好事。种族也不是好事。你知道，心理问题也不是好事。

这世界出了什么问题？我们要把它纠正过来。所以马克思有一个想法。他批评了资产阶级和生产资料的拥有者，并说基本上，经济上的国家控制会带来改变。

弗洛伊德也有一个方法论。每个人都有自己的方法论。佛教徒认为，**真正的问题是**个体意识。你认为自己是独立的自我，却看不到你的灵魂的一部分。

而柏拉图和希腊人则认为，**真正的问题是**物质世界如何把你拖累下来。每个人都说，这就是罪恶。这就是反派。这就是问题所在。

你需要做什么来纠正它。每个人都有这样的世界观。无论你是谁，你都无法摆脱它。但世界观实际上只是一个关于你认为世界出了什么问题、谁站在正确的一方可以扭转局面、谁站在错误的一方反对扭转局面以及**我们需要做什么的主导叙述。**

## 基督教的主故事 / The Christian Master Story

The biggest problem, of course, that actors have, unlike writers or maybe other kinds of artists, is generally speaking, unless you, I guess some of you have done this, you're acting out.

You're embodying stories that somebody else has written. And you might say, was Christians, you say, I never act in a story that I feel like is a great Christian story with a Christian message to it. Well, I want you to consider something for a second.

What is the Christian master story? What do we think the world story is? What do we think the main problem is?

What do we think the master story is? Here's let me give it to you in a nutshell. Everything was created good, but everything has fallen through sin.

Everything is broken through sin. And through Christ, everything's going to be redeemed. Now, let me tell you what that means.

A Greek worldview says the body's bad. The spirit is good. The Buddhist worldview says the spirit is good, but material reality is an illusion.

You know, Marx would actually say, you know, the capitalists are bad and the proletariat's good. The awful lot of conservatives would say it's the other way around. You know, the proletariat, the great unwashed, we have to watch out, you know, about, we have to be careful about them.

You know, they don't know what's, you know, there's Hobbes as opposed to Locke. Everybody had, everybody said, this is what's wrong with the world. The Christian story refuses to vilify any one created thing.

We would never say the body's bad and the spirit's good because we believe the body and the spirit are both sinful. They've both been tainted with sin. The problem in the world is sin, not this group of people versus this group of people, not culture versus nature or nature versus culture or anything like that.

The Christian worldview never vilifies any one thing, nor does it idolize anything. You know, so in Marxism, there's certain people that can do no wrong and certain people can do no right. But every single worldview tends to paint things in black and white because the protagonist are always these people and the antagonist are always these people.

If you believe the Christian storyline, your sinners, you are not the good guys. And they're out there, the people aren't Christians, they're in the image of God. They're not actually the bad guys.

Christians have a story that is the most nuanced of all stories. We should be the slowest to, you know, to put white hats on some people and dark hats on other people. And we should be the, it should be the easiest for us to look into almost anybody else's story, no matter out of any other worldview and say, yeah, I mean, see, for example, because we believe that every part of the human body is fallen, every part of the human personality is fallen.

If you get a story that talks about the dangers of sexual activity, okay, but if you get a story that actually lifts up the beauty of sexuality, that's okay too. See, we're not like Buddhists or the Greeks who just see sexuality is actually basically a seductive thing because we like the material world. We think it's a good thing.

We think God created the material world and Jesus has a material body. So Christians ought to be able to find elements of their story and almost any other story. I mean, obviously there are stories that you don't want to act in that actually are deliberately trying to lift up the very worst things and celebrate them.

But generally speaking, I would think Christian actors would be able to find a good reason to act in an awful lot of other stories, an awful lot of other stories because other stories, people's stories tend to tell part of the Christian story because the Christian story so comprehensive. Everything is good. Everything was created good and therefore there's really nothing to be looked at.

But everything is fallen, so there's nothing that you should be lifting up. So almost any story that shows you the problem of anything is possible. Almost any story that shows you the goodness of anything is possible.

It's all part of the Christian story. One last thing and then we'll take some questions. At this point, you've got to pretty much act in other people's stories.

But if you ever get a chance to put your own together and act them out, what I find fascinating about evangelism, I've come to realize that when I was younger, people said, well, here's how you share your faith and they would give me outlines. There's various outlines. Let me give you a quick example of the problem with that.

My parents' generation, and they're in their 80s now, the whole generation of my parents had in a sense, there was in America when they grew up and their depression in World War II, their cultural narrative, their main cultural story, was what really matters in life is not what you believe, but that you're a good person, a really good person, that you're decent, you're honest, you're good to your family, you're hardworking, that was the cultural narrative. My children who are now in their 20s, early 20s, my kids, I see they're part of a different generation and their cultural narrative is not the important thing is to be good. For them, the important thing is to be free and to be free to be really yourself and not to be enslaved or not to be oppressed or not to be controlled by anything else.

If you say that my kids' generation, the important thing is to be good, they would say to find good. If you said that to my parents' generation, nobody would say that. Now, what's the gospel?

Well, you can say Jesus died for your sins, yes, of course, but what is sin? You have to connect, grace sin, you have to connect the Christian story with the baseline cultural narratives of your own, of the story of the generation. So, for example, what I would say to I still do to older people, I would say, you think you're good, but you're really not good enough.

You actually fall down in all these ways, only through Jesus can you be forgiven. But what I'd say to my kids' generation is you think you're free, but you're really not. Because if you make anything other than Jesus Christ, the center of your life, you're a slave to that.

And therefore, only through Christ will you be freed. Now, by the way, in the Bible, what's interesting, there's a place where Paul says, he says, the Jews wanted power, and the Greeks wanted wisdom. But I preached them Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, though foolish and weak.

Now, here's what he was saying. What he's trying to say is, Greeks were intellectuals, and what they really thought was important was philosophy and understanding and rationality. The Jews were practicals.

And what they wanted to know is how does it work? They wanted power. They wanted results.

He did not preach Christ to them the same. What he did was on the one hand, he challenged the Jews' story, basic cultural story, and said, Jesus Christ seems nuts to you because he came in weakness, a weak Messiah on the cross. And yet, it's really the strength he've always been looking for.

And he says something differently to the Greeks. He says, Jesus Christ is foolish. In other words, he wasn't educated, he didn't go to the right schools, he didn't write any books.

And yet, he's got the real wisdom that you're looking for. In other words, what Paul is trying to say is that only in Jesus Christ does the baseline cultural story of any group or generation or society have a happy ending. What your society wants, is it wisdom, is it power, is it freedom, is it goodness, whatever they want, it'll only have a happy ending in Jesus.

Otherwise, it'll self-destruct. Because what it'll do is it'll turn, it'll turn something that's inadequate into the protagonist's hero. And it'll turn something which is good and created, though fallen, into the villain, into the antagonist, into the idol.

So I would have to say that if you understand the Christian's story, and you are basically storytellers, which is what actors are. In the long run, Christianity is so comprehensive that you should be able to appreciate and take part in other people's stories knowing that you're actually bringing about truth into the people's lives, you're watching it. And ultimately, I think it's important to really, really get engaged and really enter in deeply into our own culture stories so that we can understand them and eventually bring Christ to bear.

If you don't get into the culture, if you don't get into the stories of the culture, when you do talk about Jesus, it just goes like this, because you're actually answering questions that they're not asking. Because ultimately, ultimately, the gospel is God saved you through a story, not through a bunch of principles. God did not show up with a bunch of principles and said, if you do these things, you'll go to heaven.

What happened was God comes in the world through Jesus Christ and saves you by what he did. He saves you through a story, a true story, of course, not through you're just being obedient and going to church and obeying. So salvation is through a story.

And the story is so comprehensive. It takes in all other stories and resolves them. So I know it's a little bit mind-blowing and over.

It's not exaggerated. I absolutely believe it, but on the other hand, I realize it's a lot to take in. So, would you please, where I have been obscure, where you want me to elaborate, where I was actually totally obscure?

Just raise a hand and let's start talking about what I just went through. So yeah, right here.

对于基督徒来说，这意味着什么呢？当然，演员最大的问题是，与作家或其他类型的艺术家不同，除非你自己在表演（假设你们中有些人这样做过），否则他们通常没有这样的问题。你正演绎着别人写好的故事。或许你会说，作为基督徒，我从不表演那些我认为有正面基督教信息的故事。

那么我想请你考虑一下。什么是基督教的主故事？我们对世界的看法是什么？我们认为主要的问题是什么？

让我用一句话概括：一切原本都是美好的，但因罪而变得破碎。通过基督，一切都将被赎回。现在，让我告诉你**这意味着什么。**希腊世界观认为身体不好，精神是好的。

佛教世界观则认为精神是好的，但物质现实只是幻象。你知道，马克思会说资本家不好，无产者好；很多保守派则认为相反，无产者、那些所谓的“未洗脑的人”，我们要小心他们，因为他们不了解真相。霍布斯和洛克的观点不同，每个人都在谈论世界的问题。基督教的故事拒绝污名化任何被造之物。

我们不会说身体是好的而精神是坏的，因为我们相信身体和精神都受到了罪的影响。世界的问题在于罪，而不是某一群体对另一群体，不是文化与自然之间的对立，也不是自然与文化的对立。基督教的世界观从不污名化任何事物，也不崇拜任何东西。在马克思主义中，有些人可以无错，而另一些人则总是有错的。

但每一个世界观都倾向于把事情黑白分明地描绘出来，因为主角总是这样的人，反派总是那样的人。如果你相信这个基督教的故事线，那么你就是罪人，不是好人；那些非基督徒的人并不是坏人，他们只是按照上帝的形象被造的。基督徒拥有一段最细腻的故事。我们应该是最不愿意给某些人戴上白帽子，给另一些人戴上黑帽子的人。

我们应该最容易能够去审视几乎任何其他人的故事，无论其来自何种世界观，并说：“是的，我明白。”因为我们相信人类身体的每一部分都是堕落的，人类个性的每一部分都是堕落的。如果一个故事谈论性活动的危害，那可以；但如果一个故事真正赞美了性的美好，这也是可以接受的。我们不像佛教徒或希腊人那样仅仅把性视为一种诱人的东西，因为我们喜欢物质世界。

我们认为它是一件好事。因为上帝创造了物质世界，耶稣也有血肉之躯，所以基督徒应该能够在几乎任何其他的故事中找到自己的元素。当然，有些故事你不想参与其中，它们实际上是故意要歌颂最坏的东西并庆祝它们。但一般来说，我认为基督教演员能够找到充分的理由去参与许多其他的故事，因为其他人的故事往往在某种程度上讲述了基督教的故事，因为基督教的故事是如此全面。

一切都是好的，一切都被创造为好，因此没有什么东西值得我们去赞美。但是每样东西都是堕落的，所以没有什么东西值得我们去歌颂。因此，几乎任何展示任何问题的故事都是可能的；几乎任何展示任何美好事物的故事也是可能的。这些都是基督教故事的一部分。

最后一点，在这之后，你基本上必须参与其他人的故事。但如果你有机会自己编排并演绎这些故事，我发现传福音非常有趣。在我年轻的时候，人们会告诉我如何分享信仰，并给出一些提纲。让我给你举个例子说明这种做法的问题。

我的父母那一代人，现在都八十多岁了，他们成长的那个年代在美国经历了大萧条和二战，那个时代的文化叙事是：人生最重要的是不是你信什么，而是你要成为一个人很好的人——一个正直、诚实、对家庭好、勤奋的人。这就是他们的文化叙事。而我的孩子们现在二十多岁，甚至更年轻一些，我看到他们属于不同的世代，他们的文化叙事不再是“要成为一个好人”，对他们来说，“自由”才是最重要的，是能够真正做自己而不受奴役或压迫。如果你说我的孩子那一代人最重要的是做好人，他们会认为重要的是找到好的。

而你如果这样对我的父母那一代人说，他们肯定不会认同。那么，福音到底是什么？当然你可以讲耶稣为我们的罪死了，没错，但什么是罪呢？你需要将恩典和罪联系起来，并且要将基督教的故事与自己所在世代的基本文化叙事结合起来。

例如，我仍然会对我年长的人们这样说：你们觉得自己很好，但实际上你们并不够好。你们在各个方面都有所亏欠，只有通过耶稣才能得到赦免。而我会对我的孩子们这一代人说：你们觉得自己是自由的，但其实并不是真的自由。因为如果你不以耶稣基督为中心来生活，你就是那个中心以外的东西的奴隶。

因此，只有透过基督，你才能获得**真正的自由。顺便提一下，在圣经中，保罗曾说过一段有趣的话：“犹太人要权柄，希腊人要智慧；我对他们却传基督的十字架，犹太人以为可耻，智慧人认为愚拙。”这里的意思是**：希腊人注重的是知识和理性，而犹太人则更看重实际应用。他们想知道的是，这一切是怎么运作的？

他们想要力量，想要结果。保罗并没有用同样的方式向犹太人传讲基督。他所做的是一方面质疑了犹太人的基本文化故事，说耶稣基督在你们看来似乎很疯狂，因为他以软弱的形式来到这个世界，在十字架上是个软弱的弥赛亚。然而，这正是你们一直在寻找的力量。

他对希腊人则说的是另一番话。他说，耶稣基督是愚拙的。换句话说，他没有受过教育，没有去正确的学校上学，也没有写过任何书籍。但是，他拥有你们真正需要的智慧。

也就是说，保罗试图表达的是，在耶稣基督里，任何群体、世代或社会的基本文化故事才有圆满的结局。你们的社会想要什么——是智慧？是力量？是自由？

是善良？无论他们追求什么，最终只有在耶稣里才能得到圆满。否则，它将会自我毁灭。因为这会让那些不足够的人成为主角，让那些虽然堕落但仍被创造出来的美好事物变成反派，变成偶像。

所以我认为，如果你理解了基督教的故事，并且你是讲故事的人——演员就是讲故事的人——从长远来看，基督教是如此全面，你应该能够欣赏并参与其他人的故事，知道你实际上是在为人们的生命带来真理。最终，我认为深入地参与到我们自己的文化故事中去是非常重要的，这样我们才能理解它们，并最终将基督带入其中。如果你不进入文化，不去了解文化的故事情节，当你谈论耶稣时，只会是这样的——因为你回答的是他们没有问的问题。因为归根结底，福音是神通过一个故事拯救了你，而不是一串原则。

神并没有带着一串原则出现，说如果你们这样做，就能上天堂。什么是真正发生的事情呢？就是上帝通过耶稣基督来到这个世界，借着祂所做的一切拯救了你。祂是透过一个故事来拯救你的，一个真实的、真实的故事，而不是因为你只是顺服、去教会和遵守规定。

所以，得救是透过一个故事。而这个故事是如此全面，它涵盖了所有其他的故事，并解决了它们。我知道这听起来可能有点令人难以置信，甚至有些难以接受。但这并不是夸大其词。

我确实相信这一点，但另一方面我也意识到这需要你消化一下。如果我在某个地方说得不够清楚，请举手让我详细解释；如果有任何模糊的地方，或者你觉得我不够清楚的地方，请告诉我。所以现在就在这里开始吧。

## 演员的圣洁与良知 / Holiness and Conscience for Actors

What about the issue of holiness for actors?

Because even in some of the best of stories, they're asked to do things like his or woman who's not their spouse. Maybe where something we're feeling or you take clothes off or even have to act out of lust or out of cruelty, have these feelings. And that seems to go against being holy because we don't really have any kind of standard for this in the Bible.

You know, the apostles were never actors or they were never, it seems like they would never put themselves in those kinds of positions where they would make themselves that vulnerable to sin. Wait, in other words, do you feel like if you're actually acting out the sin, but you're not doing the sin? So what do you mean?

In other words, if you're acting out something that would be wrong if you were doing it in reality, but you're not actually doing it on the stage, or are you doing it? Let's say you're married and you have to kiss the same person every day, eight times a week. That can probably maybe create some feelings of lust for that specific person.

Then don't do it. That's all. I mean, and you have to know your own, you have to know yourself here.

You know, the book, Screwtape Letters by C. S. Lewis, okay.

Which by the way, John Cleese, you know who John Cleese is? John Cleese, though I understand it's hard to get them anymore. John Cleese has read a selection of them and it's hilarious.

He's wonderful. But however, it's a letters of a senior devil to a junior devil on how to attempt human beings. And in the beginning, in the intro, there's an interesting place where Lewis has said that it was hard.

In other words, he says, in order to write the book, he had to imagine himself being evil, which isn't terribly hard. And he actually, he quotes a place in Deuteronomy where he says, my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly. Because he says, because he was a professor of medieval literature, a couple of reviewers had said, well, the reason this is so realistic about, you know, how Screwtape's knowledge of sin and temptation and seduction is clearly based on Professor Lewis's mastery of the medieval literature on moral philosophy and the Catholic church.

And Lewis says, just not truly. He says, my own heart showed me the way of the ungodly. He says, I, I basically was able to access my own heart, all the evil nasty things and bad things and that Screwtape did.

But he says, there was a place at which I had to stop. Because I said, by imagining it, I was, he says, at some point I really felt like I was going to suffocate. So I stopped.

Now you see, he couldn't even write that. Would you have said, oh, he shouldn't write that. He couldn't write that without he had to be careful.

Because it was, you know, it's sort of the opposite of a quiet time where you're trying to get in touch with your best side and you're trying to fan the flame of, you know, what God has done there by the Holy Spirit. The trouble with if you're acting the part of an evil person or a wicked person or even writing in his case, it was a fiction piece. So it's basically the same thing.

He found that there was a limit at one point where he said, I just have to stop this because it's, you know, I'm accessing parts of myself that shouldn't be there anyway. So I would say that you have to be very careful, but doesn't mean that you should never be able to depict badness or sin in this. The Bible depicts it.

It's horrible things in the Bible. And I think most people would say, well, I could act a biblical story, right? I mean, wouldn't, wouldn't you want to act out a biblical story?

But somebody's got to act the evil people in the biblical story. So at least, and you say, well, it's in, it's in, you know, it's in the service of telling people the truth. But see, somebody's going to have to do it.

See, watch your own heart. I just know there's certain people that are able to detach and certainly hurt not. Now, I know something about the method acting thing unless that's dead now or is it not?

No, it's not dead. To me, there's a big difference between saying, I know enough that I can act this out. And I think that's very different than people say, I want you to hate, I just want you to fill your heart with hate.

You know, you're supposed to be acting out hate. So I want you to feel hate. I want you to hate the person on the stage.

I don't think that's acting anymore. I'm sorry. Acting is, you are trying to look like something that you're not.

I mean, there's John Wayne, as I was talking about. There's people who made lots of money with that acting at all. And there's a few other people I'll name that I won't name.

But who clearly don't do any acting, they just, they obviously just get up there and they feel their feelings and they do what they do. And for whatever reason, people have paid money to see it. But I think acting really means I'm, I'm supposed to act hateful, but not be hateful.

And I do, I certainly know there's acting coaches that want you to be hateful. I don't know what you say. You just smile.

You know, I don't see how you can, first of all, I'm not sure how you can do that, frankly. I even wonder whether that's even possible. So watch out.

I'm sorry, I should, let's get some other questions, but that was a great question. It's estimated that most of us spend half of our waking hours at work. How does the wisdom of the Bible apply to our careers?

In other words, how can our work connect with God's work? And how can our vocations be more emotional? In his book, Every Good and Devere, Tim Keller draws from decades of teaching on vocation and calling to show you how to find true joy in your work.

As you serve God and others, the book offers surprising insights into how a Christian perspective on work can serve as the foundation for a thriving career and a balanced personal life. Every Good and Devere is our thank you for your gift to help gospel and life share Christ's love with more people around the world. Just visit gospel and life dot com slash give that's gospel and life dot com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the remainder of today's teaching. Let's keep going, Max.

Right. Do you have a vision for your demer's role in the second part of that? I'm off for it.

It's not specifically. No, of course. Who knows?

I didn't realize when did the Salvation Army two years ago? Yeah, you know, you know, Ray Crox, it was in the paper. Did you see that?

The founder of McDonald's, his widow recently gave the Salvation Army $1.5 billion. Yeah, four. Well, yeah, but they're trying to create community centers, 25 communities and that's a lot of money.

Who knows? I'm not sure what they expect to be doing with all that, but if they're building, if they're able to build small theaters and all that, yeah, that's, that is beautiful. When you see Flannery O'Connor, and what I did was I had been here since I read the art, read the short story when I said, gosh, what would take Bill T.

Jones? Clearly, he even says he's hostile to Christianity. He doesn't like it at all, but he was overwhelmed by what a great story it was.

I said, wouldn't it be great? I mean, we don't have many contemporary Christians who create stories that good, that actually draws people in because they sense the truth of it, even though intellectually, I mean, intellectually, they don't believe Christian doctrine, but the trouble, a story flies beneath the radar and hits them in the imagination. Where the Bible says there is a knowledge of God, Romans 1, where it says they hold down the truth and unrighteousness.

There is a knowledge of God, and stories get to people at that, at that level, frankly. So I, you know, I would say it's going to take time for us to, you know, you don't have enough Christians even trying, and it takes, you know, it takes, it seems to take thousands of people trying to get a few people through, you know, and hit it. So we need a lot more people trying.

But sure, I mean, I'm all for it. I'm serious, but I can't say beyond that exactly. I know what's going to happen.

I'm open to suggestions. I'm sure you're all ready to give me some. Some other, yes.

Go ahead. Could you comment a little bit about working the Christian storyline deep down into the fabric of something, the way you do it, the law of the race? Yeah.

In other words, the Christian storyline, I didn't mention it because I always thought that, I thought that actors, I know actors would like to be writers, right? They'd like to put your own stuff together. Well, also, is there anything, I'm not a part of the question, is there, is there any other forms of theater or film or anything that you would cite as a very good example of that, but that it's not, you know, purely a sort of a Christian play on the surface?

Oh, yeah. You know, I should, I need to access my memory tapes. Yes.

The question would be, first question is, and I agree with this, even since I said it, it's nice that I still agree with what I said a year ago, is that one of the problems that I think a lot of Christians make when they tell the Christian story is they don't bury the narrative deep in, yeah, in the cultural form. So what was, to me, brilliant about Tolkien, here's a guy, he's a professor of Anglo-Saxon, he's probably one of the three or four people in the world at his, you know, in his heyday, who knew the most about Old English, the language and Gothic and Icelandic and Finnish and, you know, Northern European pagan pre-historical roots. And what he did was he saw, he said, did you know, for example, Northern European mythology?

You know what Gurdardemmerung is? You know, you say, well, yeah, that's something with Wagner. Do you know, in Northern European mythology, the Danemois, the final, in the final sort of Armageddon, is that the gods and the heroes of all the centuries are resurrected to battle against the monsters and the ogres and the demons and all the villains.

There's this huge battle on this particular plane to see who's actually going to win the world for the rest of eternity. And the gods and the heroes die. That's what's called Gurdardemmerung is the twilight of the gods.

They all, the good guys lose. And that's how history is going to go. And the Anglo-Saxon, the Northern European mythology was, that's okay because nobility is to be good even though you know you're going down to a never ending defeat.

That was nobility. A high doom was before the hero that I'm going to do what is right. And actually, what's interesting is if you've ever read the dream of the rude, which is an old English poem, but it's a Christian poem because Christianity came.

They were fascinated by the idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross. That's nobility. Knowing that the right thing to do was to go down to this terrible defeat.

And that got into the Anglo-Saxon world and sort of, you know, it came in it. It wasn't a complete head on collision between what Christianity said, the pessimism of the Northern European world met the optimism of Christianity and it changed the pessimism. But the idea of nobility and heroism and valor and doing what's right even though you're dying as you do it was not really changed.

It was redeemed. Now, Tolkien tried to imagine the Anglo-Saxon mythology, which is all lost because those dirty French-speaking Normans came over across the channel in the Battle of Hastings and wiped out the Anglo-Saxon culture. We have almost, we have something like 45 pages of Anglo-Saxon ancient literature and everything, all the rest of it's gone.

So what Tolkien said is, I want to imagine what all that mythology would be like. I'm going to imagine and then I'm going to have to be pre-Christian. But I'm a Christian.

And therefore, what I'm going to do is I'm going to imagine pre-Christian mythology sort of cleansed of a lot of its pessimism. Yes, even though if you read Lord of the Rings, it's sad. It's a very sad.

He wanted to keep that and wanted to keep the idea that you can't win without losing as least as much as you won. And he kept that because he loved the sadness and he felt that that was part of... He thought that was Christian.

He was pre-Christian. It was common grace. It was general revelation.

It was revelation that came to them even though they weren't Christians yet. It was truth. So what he tried to do was he tried to enter into these ancient myths and preserve the truth and actually enhance it a little bit from a Christian perspective.

And when it was all done, he's a great example of this because there's no overt reference of any sort in the Lord of the Rings to Christianity or religion or even God. But when you're all done, you feel cleansed with it. When you read a thing, you say, I've read a holy thing.

I feel cleansed by it. How did that happen? He buried the narrative, the storyline.

So you have Gandalf's resurrected Lord and Frodo's the suffering servant and Aragren's returning king and you've got it everywhere. But he doesn't have a Christ figure. He's got so many of them.

So if he had a Christ figure, if he had an azzle on or something like that, then it looks like a Christian fable or a parable. Now what was your second part of your question, though? Is there any?

Is there any other works that you would know? No, but you know, there are a lot of movies when you're done with them or plays when you're done with them. You say, it's very obvious the person who wrote that was not a Christian, but what they wanted to say was very important for people to hear if they're ever going to be prepared for Christianity.

And I see them all over the place. Yeah, I mean, whether or not they actually realize that they're writing something that is for family. Yeah.

You know, I used to the first movie we had. It was just like a scene in the hours when Virginia Woolf says to a Virginia Woolf's husband says to her, why does somebody have to die? And the answer is so that others will, I can't remember exactly, appreciate life more or something like that.

And he says, who has to die and she says the poet, the visionary? Yeah, there's lots of, you know, what Lewis said that God gave the pagans good dreams. You know, and there's all sorts of clues all through them.

You know, the Clint East would move the unforgiven. Anybody know that movie? Very violent movie, really.

It's just about a guy who goes and shoots everybody. It's kind of interesting. At the very end, this kid sidekick who's seen all this bloodshed, do you remember this at all?

He's just chugging down some alcohol, just trying to study his nerves and he said, all these people that we've killed, they had a common. They deserved it, right? And Clint East would say, we all deserve to be killed.

We all deserve to die. We all deserve to be shot. You know, which of course, from a Christian point of view is absolutely true in a way, but you know, I don't know what I don't know was in the mind of the writer, but it's all, I mean, I know to some degree, you actors have got to pay your dues.

You've got to act. You've got to get your experience. You've got to get to know people.

You've got to hone your skills. And very often, you're doing things that you say, what redeeming social value is this? But on the other hand, a lot of preachers spend a lot of time doing that in the early days, too.

What am I doing for Jesus preaching here in the middle of hot coffee, Mississippi, to 15 old ladies every Sunday? And a lot of people, that's how you get started. It doesn't seem like you're really changing the world.

It's not a whole lot different. So some other. Yes, I'm sorry.

Go ahead. Oh, yeah. I actually had a question.

You probably already know this like in the past, like before my age, a lot of actors, like, well, yeah, like they're excommunicated from their church for acting. And it goes back to the whole St. Augustine thing about Mendacity and backding and all the aspects.

I just like to think I just like to hear from you a few more examples of acting in the Bible. Would you say like Jeremiah portraying something silently? Well, you're asking two good questions.

The one question, of course, is the church has been nasty to actors for many years. And I still have some trouble, frankly, and I know something about church is I have a little trouble understanding the theological justification for excluding acting and drama because I keep thinking one of the things is, it's impossible to preach. You don't, you know, you're preaching as a form of acting.

I don't think they know that. I mean, you, you're acting out ideas. You're acting out illustration.

Sometimes you're acting out stories. I'm trying to figure out why they would say, I don't quite completely understand. There's no doubt that they said you do the immoral things.

Your portrayal character was doing well. Well, yeah, you're portraying. So you're not allowed to, well, see the real, if they had said you must never write fiction in which you're portraying people doing immoral things.

Which is, to me, the difference is very, very small, whether you're, whether you're writing a story or acting out a story, you are still telling a story. And what I can't quite figure out is what the theological distinction would be between writing the screw tape letters and acting evil on a, you know, acting like an evil character on the stage. I don't understand.

I still haven't figured that out. Now, second question, oh, in the Bible, my friend, Trevor Longman, who has written the best commentary ever on Ecclesiastes, says the book of Ecclesiastes is almost certainly a play. And here's how this works.

He wrote his doctoral dissertation at Yale on fictional accadian autobiography, accadian AKKADIA. And I'm not, don't write it down, but I just want to say what is this? And what he meant is that in ancient times, in the accadians, which were contemporaries to the Jews and all that, there was a particular form of, I guess you could say, it was a literary genre, in which in the beginning you spoke in the first person.

And you said, I'm going to tell you this story, I'm going to do this and this and this, and I'm going to be this person, this person, and then you go into character. You say, now I'm this, and I'm doing this, now I'm this, and then we're doing this, now at the end you come out again and say, now what did we learn? And if you actually look at the book of Ecclesiastes, which is notoriously hard to outline, because in the very beginning he talks about, you know, Solomon the King and the third person, and then he talks about I am Solomon the King and I have seen all these riches and it means nothing to me.

It's vanity, all this vanity. And then suddenly he says, and now I have, you know, I have done learning and I have gotten all my PhDs, and it means nothing to me. And at the very end he comes out and says, now what have we learned?

And Trempord pretty much proves by saying, this is exactly the kind of literary genre we had in the past where it's basically one man play. Comes up and says, I'm going to do this, and then acts it out, and then at the end says, what have we learned? And he says, it's a written out play which could be acted out and it actually could be acted out extremely well.

The other thing is all the prophets did do acting as you have already wisely alluded to. Ezekiel was the worst. I mean, I'm trying to remember what they were, but I mean, Jeremiah would not just come in and preach a sermon about the fact that you have thrown off God's yoke, he would come in wearing a yoke.

And he would say, you've thrown off God's yoke, or he would take a scroll and cut it up and throw it in the fire as he was talking and so on. So they acted as well. The problem with saying you shouldn't be an actor or you shouldn't do those things is that the line between fiction, writing fiction and acting, the line between preaching and any kind of storytelling, and then going one step further with a bring an object, you know, one step further bringing a yoke or something.

And the next, what are you doing? I mean, I don't know how you can, where do you draw the line? Say, that's acting and that's not.

That's stage and that's not. It's impossible. And it's legalistic, frankly, whenever you try to draw lines, the Bible hasn't drawn.

So do you get a lot of it? Well, never mind. Let's keep going.

Yes, go ahead. I just want to ask about drawing the line because I tend to look at the whole piece as a whole, like you were saying, if there was any redeeming value in the in the whole story or the whole play or whatever, and then, you know, whether that's something that wanted to participate. Yeah.

Because any character you do is going to be doing things that are not righteous and holy, right? There wouldn't be a story. Right.

So you got to have antagonists. Right. You're going to be dramatic conflicts.

You're going to, if I draw the line, there's a point where you draw the line in terms of what I would portray and also how I view the whole piece, right? Your conscience. Now, this is the sort of thing that you should be trying to come together as actors in a city and talk about.

And you ought to give one another. Here's how I draw the line. And here's where I draw the line.

And you need to try this out. And maybe, maybe you would develop a cumulative wisdom that we don't have right now. And that there might be a, you know, a couple of different theories that guidelines that Christian actors in New York have developed about where you draw the line.

But in the end, we, we have got a Presbyterians have a confession. And there's a chapter in a confession called Liberty of Conscience. And that confession says that you mustn't bind other people's conscience is where the Bible hasn't.

So the Bible says you can't commit adultery. Then you just can't. I'm sorry, I don't care what God told you.

I don't care what you're, you know, you think the Spirit told you. You can't. But as you say, I can, you know, I can do this on stage.

But I can't do that. I can do this on stage. Common sense, I think for most Christians would be, you know, that you can't do that.

But we have to be very careful about saying, if you're a Christian, you shouldn't be doing that. Because, because Liberty of Conscience is, the Bible hasn't told me exactly where. So we're going to have to use, watch your conscience, do not violate your conscience.

See, if you go further than your conscience, really will let you go, because I need the job, or I want the prestige, or I want the money, you hurt yourself pretty badly. Don't do it. Don't say, well, you know, everybody else thinks this is all right.

And I guess it's okay. If your conscience can't bear it, don't you dare do it. It says in James, whatever you do, it's not a faith for you, it's sin.

You just cannot do it. So it is important to check your conscience out. You know, you're ahead of your hand up, right?

And then, oh, is this on this? Go ahead. What about the weaker brother?

Is that part of your conscience? You're talking about what other people think? Well, you know, you're part of a community.

You're part of a community. And if you find that you're the only one that thinks it's okay to do that. And, you know, your 25 best Christian actor friends think it's wrong.

You probably ought to think twice. What if you're just being extra sensitive to that one, or a few people that may be offended? Your artist, you're going to be sensitive.

If anybody, if anybody thinks you've done wrong, and they're really disappointed in you, is that what you mean? In other words, you do something, and you feel like, here's a person over there. It was possible for everyone to stumble.

What defines stumble? Good question. Matt at you, think you're stupid.

That's not stumbling. That's true. You're absolutely right.

When the Bible says, don't call somebody to stumble. What that really means is you should not be helping someone else do something. One of the troubles is, the actual place where this happens is Jews were eating meat off her to idols because in their culture, an idol is nothing.

Many of the pagan people had become Christians. To them, the idols were really a big deal. They had worshipped them and so on.

When they saw Jews eating meat off her to idols, and it didn't bother them, the Gentiles said, I guess I can, and when they did it, they felt cut off from God and terrible and all that. Paul said, what you're doing is encouraging somebody else to do something that they just can't do in faith and don't do it, but I'm not quite sure what that would be here. Be careful.

Stumbling doesn't just mean offend somebody, or even upset them. Well, I can dance if that may be hard for some people who have issues watching dance. Fine.

Right. I mean, you do know from culture to culture, what is considered authoritarian in one culture is considered, you know, is considered sort of a normal exercise authority in what one culture, I mean, it's not what one culture considers a lascivious another culture doesn't. So you do ultimately, you do have to beg one another, not to try to bind people's consciences where the Bible's left them free and just say, you know, I beg you, if this bothers you, or if you can't do this, if it gets into your heart to be kissing somebody for eight weeks in a row, then just don't do it.

Follow your conscience. But then respect each other's consciences. Don't say, oh, you know, you're weakling or what's the matter with you.

You're not professional. What's the matter? Can't you be detached?

Nor do the opposite and say, look at that person who's clearly going into sin, but keep in touch with each other and ask each other, are you really able to do that? You had your hand up, right? I'm going to go.

The Catholics right now are vastly better at supporting artists than evangelical Christians, way, way, way past. I mean, yeah, they may have burned a few of you at the stake over the years, but you know, come on, get, you know, let's buy gospel, buy gospel. But they were actually good.

Actually, Flannery O'Connor wrote a great book called Mystery in Manors that is wonderful. It's mainly for writers, but you'd learn a lot from it. I haven't over here.

Yes, go ahead. Let me get just three of you over here. Yes, go ahead.

I've seen opera now, but I started out wanting to be an actress, and one of the things that I faced was that people at church felt that I was only seeking glory for myself. And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how we can project what attitude we should have as artists and what attitude, how can we help people? If you were singing the church, that'd be different.

Well, as if you're singing in the church, that's not seeking glory for yourself. I mean, think about this. I mean, have any of you ever been inquires?

Do you think there's any people inquires around the country that are seeking glory for themselves now? What about preachers? Do you think there's any preachers?

I mean, everybody who's up front is God of the danger of seeking glory for themselves. I think just what you have to say, of course, it's a huge danger, but we don't have any more, say we have the same amount of danger of that that the ministers do or the Christian singers do. So nevertheless, after you have dealt with that problem, it is a problem, by the way.

I mean, you know, I have to say, why am I really doing this? If I hone certain skills that are like acting to some degree, I hone certain skills. It's sort of preaching as a combination.

In some ways, I've got to be a good writer. In some ways, I've got to be a good actor. And if I hone those skills and people come out to listen to me, you've come out to listen to me, why am I doing that?

I mean, I've got the same problem you do. I mean, it's no different. It's a big problem.

But just because you want to be an artist or an opera singer and actor doesn't mean you've got a bigger problem than anybody else, that's all. I would not say to a Christian, oh, you can't. Again, the conscience, very important.

Where is the totalization line getting drawn here? I mean, you know, there's some stuff you say obvious. Everybody knows, you know, there's, you know, full frontal nudity.

And I mean, there's some things to say, okay, so we start where we all agree you're not going to do. But then what happens is as we go, what about this? What about this show?

What about this show? Next thing you know, we're divided. Somebody say, well, I don't have a problem with that.

And somebody say, we have those conversations. And then please respect each other's decisions. And over a generation, you could become wise as a Christian community and come to more consensus and work the thing out.

Just don't freak out over somebody. There's always somebody to your left and somebody to your right. There's always somebody who thinks you're the liberal, you know, or you're the sell-out, or there's somebody who thinks you're the moralist, you're the legalist.

I generally feel that you, like I said, just like ministers, you gotta, you gotta take roles that at least, me, you gotta do some things that at least are probably useless. You know, they're useless to society. They don't really do much of anything.

I just want stuff that is really, you know, really, there is plenty of stuff out there that is just trying to pull away traditional values. It's just after it. They're just trying to do it.

I don't want to be part of that. But how do we know that ones there and there talk about it with each other? Try to draw lines.

You're not going to figure this out overnight. You're not going to figure out overnight. The younger you are, the more you're likely you are to do things that you just, you know, you feel a little bad in the conscience, but I think you can do it, but watch it and talk to each other about it.

And don't and don't violate your conscience very much. You know, once, once you know you violated it back out, when you're not sure, sometimes I can't tell I violated it till I try and then I realize I'm over the line. Let's keep going.

Yes, sure. Do I work hard? Do I push, you know, and that element of saying, hey, about I know you're in control of this and trusting him and then doing my part as well in terms of what business aspect of this.

And that really plus any question, but simply for acting. Well, you know, the problem with acting is that you don't get nearly as much negative. There's almost no other career where you get so much negative assessment.

You just don't get turned down. I mean, it's just nuts. You know, once a year, you can take a job in one of these high rates, once a year, you sit down, you get a performance evaluation and they say, well, you're not doing very well.

Or maybe even we're going to fire you if you don't stop this and it's, you know, and then six months later they fire you. That's a lot better than being an actor where you get all these turn downs and being ignored. It's pretty tough.

So I, and actually I really do think it's because of that a lot, as you all know, I guess your community is filled with people who have a lot of a lot of emotional well fragility. Yeah, really emotionally fragile, which doesn't surprise me. I don't think I'm not sure you're emotionally fragile and therefore you want to be an actor.

I think you're an actor and next thing you know, you're like, you know, but so you do need that, but nevertheless, with any career, you have to say, when have I, should I be pushing harder, is that why I'm not getting any further? And when do I give up and try something else? But on the other hand, when I was in seminary, there was seminaries that train ministers, they don't care whether you're gifted or called or going to be any good, they just didn't want your tuition.

So they're putting you through and halfway through or at the end, people are saying, I want to be a minister and almost everybody can look and say, that person's never going to be a minister. A person doesn't have what it takes, but nobody told them about that. So actually I spent a good deal of time because some of you heard me do this before.

I came up with a, with a three, a tripod called Ability Affinity Opportunity and Ability means you're good and other people think you're good. Affinity means I'm really passionate. I love it.

Opportunity means God opens the doors. And you might say, how do I know whether or not I'm, you can't mess up your life. You can't.

Just the other day, somebody called me and said, I listened to sermon by somebody and they seemed to indicate that the reason I'm not married is because I'm not praying enough. Okay. And I want to be married and I'm not praying enough.

And so is the reason I'm not married because I'm not praying enough and therefore I'm, I'm sinning. I said, well, you know, Jacob's sinned. He dressed up as he saw and he ruined his whole family and created all, you know, I just really screwed everything up.

And God used the sin to find him the family that God wanted him to have. He wouldn't had, he wouldn't have found the family wouldn't had the children. It was all through the sin.

So I said, what, what about your theory that the reason my life's not going the way God wants it is because maybe I'm sinning. I personally think God is so sovereign that if you sin, if you do something wrong, there's going to be devastation in your life for a long time and it's your fault. And yet if you sin and if you're his child and he loves you, then all those promises are going to come to you anyway and he'll bring his blessing into your life through the sin.

Now, you know, you'll spend all your life wishing you hadn't done it and you shouldn't have done it. But he's, you can't mess up your life. So don't, just don't kill yourself trying to be successful if he's just don't.

However, if after a period of time, and I don't know how long to tell people to wait, the affinity, ability and opportunity don't come together. There's some people who want to do it and everybody says they can do it and the opportunity is just don't come. You're just never the right person at the right place in the right time with the right cheekbone structure.

You know how that works. You know, it has not, you know, so often it has has absolutely nothing to do with talent, just that I'm looking for somebody your size, the your cheekbone structure, you know, the way you wink, you know, that's the way that we want. And next thing, you know, the career is made.

You know, if that will make you a Calvinist, I don't know what will. I don't know what will. So, well, if the opportunity doesn't come, or if you, you know, unless they all come together at once and after you've knocked and knocked and knocked and knocked, then don't be afraid that somehow you have failed to, you've met, mucked up your life that God wanted you to be an actor and now you can't be because you didn't try hard enough, just relax a little bit.

So, in some ways, you are where everybody else is, but I think it is mostly harder to stay at acting long term if you just don't have those doors open. Other people can work a lot longer at their job before they say, I'm going to try something else. So, you do need to support each other, but in the end, I think acting, actually, most people I know who've been actors who go do something else, it enriches their ability to do a lot of other things.

Don't think, I put all this time into it, almost almost anything else you do. Presentation is very important and your ability to do presentation and to know how to do presenting to people will stand you in good stead for a long time.

关于演员的圣洁问题，你们觉得如何？

因为即使在最好的故事里，他们也可能会被要求做一些事情，比如和不是配偶的人发生关系，或者是脱衣服、甚至表现出淫欲或残忍的行为。这似乎与圣洁相悖，因为我们圣经中并没有这样的标准。你知道，使徒们从来都不是演员，他们似乎也不会让自己处于那种容易犯错的位置。换句话说，你觉得如果你在表演的时候真的在做这些事情，但你实际上没有真正去做这些事情，那是什么意思呢？

换句话说，如果在舞台上表演一些现实中是错误的事情，但实际上你并没有真正去做，那么你是在做什么？比如说，你已经结婚了，每天要吻同一个人八次。这可能会引发对那个人的某种欲望。那就不要做吧。

也就是说，你需要了解自己。你知道《 Screwtape Letters》这本书吗？C. S. Lewis 的作品。顺便说一句，John Cleese 你知道他是谁吗？

John Cleese 虽然现在很难找到他的读本，但他曾朗读过其中的一些篇章，并且非常有趣。他真是奇妙。但事实上，这更像是一个高级恶魔写给初级恶魔的一封信，讲述如何试探人类。在开头的介绍部分，刘易斯曾说过，写作这本书对他来说并不容易。

换句话说，为了写这本书，他不得不想象自己是邪恶的，而这其实并不难。他还引用了《申命记》中的一段话：“我自己的心向我显露通达罪人的道路。” 因为他说，因为他是一位中世纪文学教授，有几位评论者曾指出，《变形计》中撒图恩关于罪恶、诱惑和引诱的知识之所以如此逼真，显然是基于刘易斯对中世纪道德哲学和天主教会的深刻理解。但刘易斯说，并非如此。

他说：“我自己的心向我显露通达罪人的道路。” 他解释说，他基本上能够接触到自己内心深处的所有邪恶、恶劣和不好的东西，这些都体现在撒图恩身上。但他又说，在某个地方，他必须停止这种想象。因为他说，通过想象，我感觉自己快要窒息了。

所以他停了下来。现在你看，他连这个都无法写出来。你会说，哦，他不应该写那个。他之所以能写出那些内容，是因为他不得不小心谨慎。

这是因为这与安静时间（quiet time）不同，在安静时间里你试图接触自己最好的一面，并通过圣灵点燃神在你身上的作为的火焰。但如果你要扮演一个邪恶的人或恶人，甚至在他的情况下是写小说，那就像是同一件事情。他发现，在某个时刻，他必须停止这种想象，因为他在触及不应该存在的部分。所以我认为，你需要非常小心，但这并不意味着你永远不能描绘出罪恶或邪恶。

圣经中就有这样的描述。圣经里有很多可怕的事情。我想大多数人都会说，我能不能演一出圣经故事呢？难道你不希望演绎一个圣经中的故事吗？

但是圣经故事中总得有人扮演那些邪恶的角色。所以至少，你会说，这有助于告诉人们真相。但你看，总得有人来做这件事。你看，要管好自己的心。

我知道有些人能够保持距离，当然不会伤害他人。我知道一些关于方法表演的事情——除非那已经过时了或者没有？不是的，它并没有过时。对我来说，说“我了解足够多，可以表现出这种行为”和那些说“我希望你们恨，我希望你们充满仇恨”的人之间有很大的区别。

你是在扮演一种恨意。所以我希望你能感受到恨意。我希望你恨那个站在台上的那个人。我认为那已经不是表演了。

对不起，**真正的表演是**试图表现一个你并不是的人。比如说，我刚才提到的约翰·韦恩。有很多人通过这样的表演赚了很多钱。还有一些其他人我不提名字，但很明显他们并没有做任何表演，只是站起来表达自己的情感，并去做他们认为正确的事情。

不管出于什么原因，人们付了钱来看这些表演。但我认为**真正的表演是**，我要表现出仇恨，但实际上并不恨。我也知道有些表演教练希望你表现出仇恨。我不知道你说什么。

你只需要微笑。我实在不明白你怎么能做到这一点。坦白说，我不确定这是否可能。所以要小心。

对不起，让我们换个问题吧，但这个问题很好。据估计，我们大多数人每天有半数清醒时间都在工作上度过。圣经的智慧如何应用于我们的职业生涯？换句话说，我们的工作如何与上帝的工作相联系？

我们的职业如何更加充满情感？在《每一份好工作》一书中，蒂姆·凯勒引用了几十年来关于职业和呼召的教学经验，向你展示了如何在工作中找到**真正的快乐。作为你们事奉上帝和他人的途径，这本书提供了关于工作的新颖见解，展示了基督徒的工作观如何成为事业成功和个人生活平衡的基础。每一位慷慨解囊帮助福音与生命向世界各地更多人分享基督之爱的人，都是**我们的感谢对象。

请访问福音与生命网站的捐款页面：gospelandlife.com/give。现在让我们继续听戴尔·辛格博士今天的教导吧。马克斯，请继续。对你的工作角色在第二部分有什么愿景吗？

我对此有些想法。不是特别明确。当然，谁知道呢？我不记得是哪两年了，但救世军两年前确实有所行动。

你知道的，雷·克罗斯，报纸上提到了。你看到那篇报道了吗？麦当劳的创始人最近向救世军捐赠了15亿美元。对，四亿。

不过，他们正在努力建立社区中心，在25个社区中开展工作，这是一笔巨大的资金。谁知道他们会怎么使用这笔钱呢？但要是他们能建起小剧院之类的设施，那真是太好了。当我读到弗兰内里·奥康纳的故事时，我想到的是，比尔·T. 琼斯会怎样处理这个故事。

显然，他甚至说他对基督教持敌对态度，完全不喜欢它，但他还是被这个故事深深打动了。我说，如果能这样该多好啊！我们确实没有多少当代基督徒创作出如此吸引人的故事，它们能够触动人心，即使从理智上他们并不相信基督教教义。但问题在于，这些故事往往悄无声息地深入人心，触动人们的想象力。

正如圣经在罗马书1章中所说：“神的事情人们原知道，因为神自创造世界以来就藉着所造的一切物给人认识。”又说：“他们的无知变得明显了。” 有关神的知识，故事总能在那个层面触动人心。所以，坦率地说，我认为**我们需要更多的时间和努力。**

你知道，现在基督徒还不够多，而且似乎需要成千上万的人尝试才能影响几个人。所以**我们需要更多的人参与进来。**当然，我完全支持这一点，我是认真的，但我不能说得太具体了。我知道会发生什么。

我很乐意接受建议。我相信你们都有很多想法要分享。是的，请说说看。你能稍微谈谈如何将基督教的故事线深深融入某种文化形式中吗？

比如你所说的“律法”或“种族法则”。对，换句话说，我之前没有提到这一点，因为我一直以为演员们会喜欢当编剧，他们想把自己的故事呈现出来。那么，除了基督教戏剧之外，还有其他形式的剧场或电影能很好地体现这种精神吗？哦，是的。

我想我需要调用一下我的记忆库。好的。问题在于，正如我之前所说的一样，我也同意这一点——很多基督徒在讲述基督教故事时的一个问题是，他们没有将叙事深深融入文化形式中。我认为托尔金的作品非常出色，他是一位盎格鲁-撒克逊语言学教授，在他的时代，他是世界上三四位最了解古英语、哥特语、冰岛语和芬兰语的人之一。

他看到了这一点：例如，北欧神话。你知道古德默尔顿是什么吗？你可能会说，哦，是瓦格纳的作品。

但在北欧神话中，达尼米尔斯的末日审判，就是诸神和历代英雄复活来与怪物、妖精和恶魔作战。在某个特定平面上有一场巨大的战斗，看谁能在永恒中赢得世界。最终，诸神和英雄们会死去。这就是所谓的古德默尔顿——诸神的黄昏。

他们输了，而且历史也将如此。北欧神话认为这没关系，因为即使知道自己注定要无尽地失败，仍要做一个高尚的人就是高贵。这是英雄主义。在《鲁德梦之梦》这首古老的英语诗歌中，你也可以看到这种想法，因为它是一首基督教诗歌，因为基督教已经到来。

他们对耶稣基督去十字架的想法感到着迷。这正是高贵的表现——知道做正确的事意味着要面对可怕的失败。这种思想进入了盎格鲁-撒克逊世界，并且逐渐融入其中。虽然基督教的乐观主义与北欧世界的悲观主义发生了碰撞并改变了后者，但关于高贵、英雄主义和勇气的精神，即使知道自己会死也要坚持做正确的事情这一理念并没有改变，而是得到了救赎。

托尔金试图想象盎格鲁-撒克逊神话，因为那些脏兮兮的法语说的诺曼人通过黑斯廷斯战役横渡英吉利海峡摧毁了盎格鲁-撒克逊文化。我们几乎只剩下45页的盎格鲁-撒克逊古代文学作品，其余的都消失了。所以托尔金说，我想想象那一切神话会是什么样子。我要去想象，并且我会是基督教徒，但同时也要保持一种前基督教的态度。

因此，我要做的是想象一下，如果把很多悲观主义从古代神话中清除掉。是的，即使你读《魔戒》，它也是悲伤的。非常悲伤。他想要保留这一点，并且保留了“你不能赢而不失去”的想法，至少你赢得越多就失去越多。

他保留这一点是因为他喜欢这种悲伤的感觉，并且觉得这是……他认为这就是基督教的一部分。他是非基督徒的。这是一种普遍恩典。是一种一般启示。

**这是一种即使他们还不是基督徒时也来到他们的真理**。所以，他试图进入这些古老的神话中，保留其中的真理，并从基督教的角度稍微增强一下。当这一切完成后，他就是一个很好的例子，因为《魔戒》中没有任何直接提到基督教或宗教的内容。但当你读完后，你会感到被净化了。

你读完一本书时会说：“我读了一本神圣的东西。” 我感到被净化了。这是怎么发生的？他埋下了叙事和情节。

所以你有甘道夫的复活之主、佛罗多的受苦仆人、阿拉肯的归来的国王，到处都是这样的象征。但他没有一个基督形象。他有这么多这样的形象。如果他有一个基督形象，比如一个耶稣或者类似的东西，那么看起来就像是基督教寓言或比喻。

那么你的第二个问题是什么？还有吗？还有其他你知道的作品吗？没有，但你知道，有很多电影看完后，或者很多戏剧演完后，你会说：“很明显写这个的人不是基督徒，但他们想传达的信息对人们来说非常重要，如果他们要为基督教做好准备的话。

” 我到处都能看到它们。是的，无论他们是否意识到自己在写的是家庭向的内容，是的。你知道吗，我以前很喜欢第一部电影。就像《到灯塔去》中 Virginia Woolf 的丈夫对她说的那样：“为什么一定要有人死去？

”答案是这样，别人才能更加珍惜生命，虽然我不记得具体是什么了。他说：“谁要死去呢？”她回答说：“诗人、先知。”确实，正如 Lewis 所说，上帝给了异教徒美好的梦境。

到处都有这样的暗示。你知道《不可饶恕》这部电影吗？Clint Eastwood 演的。这是一部非常暴力的电影。

故事中，一个男人去杀了很多人。最后，一个小跟班目睹了这一切，还记得这个情节吗？他喝着酒，试图稳定一下自己的情绪，并说：“我们杀的所有人其实都有共同点，他们应该死，对吧？”Clint Eastwood 会说：“我们都该死。

” 我们都该死。我们都该被射杀。当然，从基督教的角度来看，这是绝对正确的，但我不知道作者当时的想法是什么，不过演员确实需要付出代价。你需要表演，获取经验，了解人们，磨练你的技能。

很多时候你可能会问自己：这有什么值得拯救的社会价值吗？但是另一方面，很多传道者在早期也花了很多时间做类似的事情。我在这里，在热咖啡密西西比，每周日给十五位老妇人讲道，你觉得我在为耶稣做什么呢？很多人都是从这样的开始做起的。

看起来你似乎并没有真正改变世界。这和演员的情况其实差不多。所以，是啊，对不起，继续说吧。哦，对了，我确实有一个问题。

你知道以前，比如在我之前的时代，很多演员因为演戏被教会开除过吗？这可以追溯到圣奥古斯丁关于撒谎和欺骗的观点。我只想再给你们举几个圣经中角色行为的例子。比如耶利米沉默地表达，你觉得怎么样？

你们问了两个好问题。当然，第一个问题是教会长期以来对演员很不友好。老实说，我对这一点有些困惑，因为我对教会有一些了解——我认为很难从神学角度为排除表演和戏剧找到正当理由。因为我觉得，传道本质上也是一种表演。

他们可能没有意识到这一点。你是在演绎思想，演绎说明。有时你在演绎故事。我试着搞清楚为什么他们会说不行，我不完全理解。

毫无疑问，他们说过演员不能做不道德的事情。你的角色表现得很好。是的，你在扮演，所以你不被允许这样做。如果他们说的是你永远不能写虚构的故事，其中的人物在做不道德的事。

对我来说，这个区别非常小，无论你是写故事还是演绎故事，你仍然在讲故事。我搞不懂的是，写作《螺丝钉信札》和在舞台上扮演一个恶角之间有什么神学上的区别。我不明白。我现在还没有想通。

第二个问题是，我的朋友特雷弗·朗曼写过最好的以斯帖书注释，他说以斯帖书很可能是一部戏剧。这里是如何运作的。他曾在耶鲁大学撰写博士论文，研究虚构的阿卡德自传，阿卡德语是古代苏美尔语的一种方言。我不用记下来，但我想说的是这是什么意思？

他的意思是，在古代时期，与犹太人同时代的阿卡德人有一种特定的文学体裁，在这种体裁中，一开始你会以第一人称说话。你曾说，我要讲这个故事，我要做这些事，我要成为这样的人，然后你就进入角色。你说，现在我是这个人，在做这件事；然后我又变成另一个人，在做另一件事；最后你又回到现实，问我们学到了什么。如果你仔细看看《传道书》，你会发现这本书很难概括，因为它一开始是以第三人称讲述所罗门王的故事，接着就变成了第一人称，“我”看到了这一切的财富，但这些对我来说毫无意义。

一切都是虚空，一切都是虚空。然后他突然说：“现在我已经完成了学习，得到了所有的博士学位，但这对我而言毫无意义。”最后，他说：“我们现在学到了什么？” 特伦普德也证明了这一点，他说这种文学体裁就是过去的一种独角戏形式：一个人上台说我要做这些事，然后就表演出来；最后再问我们学到了什么。

他甚至说，这本可以写成剧本，并且能够很好地进行表演。另外，先知们确实也进行了表演，你已经明智地提到了这一点。以西结是最典型的例子。我试着回忆一下，但无论是耶利米还是其他先知，他们不只是讲道，还会穿上象征意义的物品。

例如，耶利米会说你们抛弃了上帝的轭，然后他就戴上一个轭；或者他会把卷轴撕碎扔进火里。问题在于，如果你禁止做演员或不允许这样做，那么虚构写作和表演之间的界限在哪里？宣讲和讲故事之间的界限又在哪里？再进一步，带上一个物体，比如一个轭或其他东西。

接下来你该怎么做呢？我不知道你怎么能划清这些界限，说这是表演，那是不算是表演。那不是舞台，那是现实。那不可能。

坦率地说，每当试图划线时，圣经并没有这样做。你懂其中的含义吗？没关系。我们继续吧。

好的，你可以先说。我只是想问一下关于划线的问题，因为我倾向于将整个作品作为一个整体来看待，就像你说的那样，如果这个故事、戏剧或任何东西中有一些值得肯定的价值观，那么我是否愿意参与呢？是的。因为任何一个角色你都会演一些不义和不圣洁的事情，对吧？

没有这样的故事就无法构成戏剧。对吧？所以你需要有反派。对。

你会有戏剧冲突。如果我要划线的话，在我所表现的内容以及我对整个作品的看法上，我会有一个界限，对吗？你的良知。现在，这正是作为演员应该在城市中一起讨论的事情。

你们应当彼此分享。这是我的界限在哪里。这是我的界限在哪里。你们需要尝试这样做。

也许，也许我们可以积累一些我们现在没有的集体智慧。也许会有几种不同的理论或指导原则，纽约的基督徒演员们已经制定了关于如何划线的一些规定。但最终，我们有长老会的信条。信条中有一章叫《良知自由》。

这个信条说，你不能强迫别人的良知，除非圣经没有这样做。圣经说你不可以通奸，那么你就不能。对不起，我不在乎上帝对你说什么。我不在乎你觉得圣灵告诉你什么。

你不能。但正如你说的，在舞台上我可以做这件事。但在舞台上我不能做另一件事。常识告诉我，大多数基督徒会认为，你不能做那件事情。

但我们必须非常小心，不要说如果一个人是基督徒，就不应该做那样的事情。因为，《圣经》并没有明确告诉我具体在哪里不可以这样做。所以**我们需要听从自己的良心，不要违背自己的良心。**你看，如果你超越了自己的良心去做，真的会让你受到伤害，因为你需要那份工作，或者你想要那种声望，或者你想要那些钱，这样对你自己来说是非常有害的。

不要做那样的事情。不要说，好吧，我知道大家觉得这个是可以接受的。如果你的良心不能忍受，那你绝对不可以去做。《雅各书》里说：“你们信神只有一位，你却以行为表明有多个。

”也就是说，如果你做的事情让你的良心不安，那对你来说就不是信仰的表现，而是罪行。所以检查自己的良心是非常重要的。你知道，你最好先停下来想一想。然后，哦，这是关于什么？

继续吧。弱者兄弟呢？那是你良心的一部分吗？你在谈论别人的看法吗？

你知道，你是属于一个社区的。你是属于一个社区的。如果你发现只有你自己觉得这样做是可以接受的，而你的25个最好的基督徒朋友都觉得不对劲，那你可能应该再三考虑一下。如果只是因为你对某一个人或者少数几个人过于敏感，可能会让他们感到冒犯，那你的艺术家身份会让你更加敏感。

如果任何人认为你做错了事，并且对你非常失望，那就是你在说什么吗？换句话说，当你做了某件事之后，你觉得那里有一个在看你的人。圣经说：“不可叫人跌倒。”这句话的意思其实是“不要帮助别人去做错事”。

其中的一个问题在于，这种行为实际发生的地方是，在犹太人吃祭偶像之物的时候。因为在他们的文化中，偶像什么都不是。许多异教徒已经成为了基督徒，对他们来说，那些偶像非常重要。他们曾经崇拜过它们等等。

当他们看见犹太人吃祭偶像之物，却不介意时，外邦人就说：“那我们也可以这样做。”但做了之后，他们却感到与神隔绝、罪恶感丛生。保罗说：“你们这样做的时候，实际上是在鼓励别人去做一些他们无法凭着信心去做的事情，而我不确定这里具体指的是什么。但要小心。

” 绊倒不仅意味着冒犯或激怒某人。好吧，我可以跳舞，这可能对某些有舞蹈障碍的人来说很难接受。没问题。确实如此。

从文化到文化，一个文化中被认为是专制的行为，在另一个文化中则被视为正常的行使权威。在一个文化中被认为是放纵的行为，在另一个文化中却不是这样。所以最终，你们必须彼此恳求，不要试图捆绑那些圣经没有捆绑的灵魂，而是说：“我知道这可能让你不舒服，如果你觉得八周内亲吻某人会让你心生罪恶感，那就不要这样做。” 听从自己的良心，但也要尊重别人的良心。

不要说：“你太软弱了，出了什么问题？”也不要反过来，看到有人显然在犯罪时却彼此疏远，而是要互相询问：“你真的能做到吗？”你的手举起来了，对吧？我这就过去。

目前天主教徒在支持艺术家方面比福音派基督徒好得多，远远超出很多。虽然他们可能在过去几百年中烧过你们中的许多人，但让我们面对现实，购买福音书籍吧。实际上，他们做得不错。事实上，《曼斯庄园的秘密》是弗兰妮·奥康纳写的一本很棒的书，非常适合作家阅读，你也会从中受益匪浅。

我还没看过这本书。好的，请三位过来。可以的话，继续。我已经看过歌剧了，但最初我是想成为一名演员。

当时人们觉得我只是为了自己寻求荣耀。你们对艺术家们应该保持什么样的态度有什么看法？如果你们在教会唱歌，那就不算是在为自己寻求荣耀。想想看，你们中有谁曾经被邀请过？

你觉得全国范围内有哪位艺人是为了一己之荣而行动的吗？牧师呢？你们觉得有没有牧师是为了自己寻求荣耀的？每个人站在前面都有可能为了自己寻求荣耀。

当然，你说的话确实有很大的风险，但我们不必担心我们会像牧师或基督教歌手那样面临同样的风险。所以，即使解决了这个问题，它仍然存在。我必须说，为什么我要这样做？如果我磨练了一些类似于表演的技能，那也是为了某种目的。

某种程度上来说，这就像在传道一样。从某些方面来看，我需要成为一个好的作家，在某些方面，我需要成为一个好的演员。如果我磨练了这些技能，人们来听我的演讲，你们也来了，那么我是为什么而来的呢？也就是说，我也有同样的问题。

这并没有什么不同，这是一个大问题。但仅仅因为你想要成为一名艺术家或歌剧演员，并不意味着你比别人有更多的问题。我说这话并不是要告诉基督徒他们不能这样做。良知非常重要。

这里的界限在哪里？有些事情很明显，大家都明白，比如全裸表演。也就是说，我们可以从大家都能同意的地方开始。但是当我们继续深入时，我们又该如何判断呢？

对于这个节目，我们应该怎么看待呢？关于这个表现呢？下一秒，我们就分裂了。有人可能会说：“我对此没有意见。

” 然后有人说：“我们得好好聊聊。”接着请彼此尊重对方的选择。经过一代人的时间，作为基督徒的社区可以变得更明智，并达成更多的共识来解决这些问题。只是不要因为某个人而惊慌失措。

总是有人在你的左边，有人在你的右边。总有人认为你是激进派，或者你背叛了信仰；也总有认为你是道德家或律法主义者的人。我通常觉得，就像我说的，作为牧师，你们得做一些至少对社会来说无用的事情。它们可能真的没有什么实际作用。

我只是希望有一些真正重要的东西。确实有很多东西在试图拉扯传统价值观，它们就是想这么做。我不想成为其中一员。但我们怎么知道哪些是这样的呢？

我们彼此讨论一下，并尝试划清界限。这不是一夜之间就能解决的。你越年轻，就越有可能做一些让你良心不安的事情，但我认为你可以做到，但要小心并和别人谈谈这些事情。不要轻易违背你的良知。

你知道，一旦意识到自己违反了它，有时我直到尝试后才明白我已经越界了。让我们继续前进吧。是的，当然。我努力工作吗？

我推动，你知道，强调你是在掌控这一切，并信任他，同时我也尽我的职责来处理商业方面的事情。这只是其中的一部分问题，但**关键是行动。**而问题在于，你不会得到那么多负面评价。几乎没有任何其他职业会像演艺行业这样受到如此多的负面评价。

你可真是不容易被拒绝。我指的是，一年之中，你可以找一份高薪的工作，一年一次，坐下来接受绩效评估，他们说你表现得不是很好。或者也许他们会告诉你，如果你不改变，就准备把你炒鱿鱼了。六个月后，他们真的把你解雇了。

这比当演员要好得多，因为演员经常被拒绝，而且常常被人忽视。那确实挺难的。所以我认为，正因为如此，你们社区里有很多情绪上很脆弱的人。是的，非常情绪化，这并不让我感到惊讶。

我觉得你的情绪很脆弱，因此你想成为一名演员。但我想你是演员，然后你就这样了。不过，无论从事任何职业，你都需要问自己：我是否应该更加努力？什么时候该放弃，尝试其他事情呢？

另一方面，在神学院读书的时候，那些培训牧师的学校并不在乎你是否有天赋或被呼召，或者是否会做得很好，他们只是不想你的学费。所以他们会把你送进去，中途或快结束时，人们会说：“我想成为一名牧师。”几乎每个人都能指出来：那个人永远不可能成为牧师，他没有那个能力。但没有人告诉过他。

所以我花了很多时间来思考这个问题，因为有些人之前听过我讲过这个观点。我提出了一个叫做“能力和热情与机会”的三角模型。能力是指你有能力做好这件事，并且别人也认为你有能力。热情意味着你真的很热爱它。

机会则是上帝为你打开门。你可能会问：如何知道我是否具备这些条件？你不会毁掉自己的生活。前几天，有人打电话给我，说他们听了一位牧师的讲道，那位牧师似乎暗示我没有结婚是因为我不够虔诚祈祷。

好吧，我想结婚，但我没有足够多的祈祷时间。> 因此，我未婚的原因是我祈祷不够，所以我在犯罪。我说，你知道吗，雅各犯了罪。他装扮成别人的样子，毁了他的整个家庭，并且制造了一切问题，我只是把一切都搞砸了。

但上帝利用他的罪，让他找到了上帝想要的家庭。如果没有那个罪，他就不会有这个家庭和孩子。一切都是通过那场罪实现的。我说，那么，你认为我生活不如意的原因是不是因为我犯罪了？

我个人认为，上帝是如此主权，如果你犯错，做了坏事，你的生活中会长期遭受破坏，这是你的责任。但如果你是他的儿女，并且他爱你，即使你犯罪，所有的应许仍然会临到你身上，他会通过那场罪给你带来祝福。你知道吗，你会花一辈子的时间后悔自己不该做这件事。但他不会让你毁掉自己的生活。

所以不要为了成功而折磨自己，上帝自有安排。然而，如果经过一段时间——我不知道应该告诉人们等待多久——亲密度、能力和机会都没有凑到一起。有些人想去做，每个人都说他们可以做到，但机会就是不来。你可能永远不是在正确的时间出现在正确的地点，拥有正确的颧骨结构。

你知道是怎么回事。很多时候，这和才华无关，我只是在寻找你的尺寸，你的颧骨结构，你眨眼的方式，这就是我们想要的。然后，你的事业就成功了。你知道，如果你因此成为加尔文主义者，那可真是个意外。

真的，我不知道还有什么能让你变成加尔文主义者。所以，如果机会没有来，或者你明白除非这些门都为你敞开，你敲了又敲，再敲，再敲，那么不要害怕自己因为没有尽力而错失了上帝希望你成为演员的机会。放松一点吧。在某种程度上，你和其他人一样，但我觉得长期坚持做演员更难的是那些机会并没有为你敞开。

其他人可以更长时间地从事他们的工作，然后才说要尝试其他事情。所以你需要互相支持，但我认为，实际上，大多数我知道的演员转行后，他们反而能更好地做很多其他的事情。不要以为你花了很多时间在这个上面，几乎任何其他你能做的事情都一样重要。你的展示能力非常重要，你知道如何向人展示自己，这将对你未来很长一段时间都有好处。
