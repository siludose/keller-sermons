## 心灵相连 / Souls Knit Together

The marks of a supernaturally changed heart. A heart changed by the grace of God and the power of the Holy Spirit are listed in the classic text Galatians 5, verse 22 and 23, which lists what's called there, the fruit of the Spirit, and those traits are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and so on.

And each week, we're taking one of those traits and looking at it in order that perhaps we could experience more of that supernatural change in our own lives. Now, tonight we get to the trait, the spiritual fruit of kindness. And whenever preachers are working through the fruit of the Spirit, this is a big challenge, this particular one because the word kindness, the Greek word translated kindness, in the New Testament has a real breadth of meaning, unfortunately.

Sometimes it can be, depending on the context, translated fitting, sometimes pleasing, sometimes honest, and sometimes compassionate. And therefore, how do you talk about kindness if it's a word that has that kind of what they call a lexical range? And the answer is you can't do it abstractly.

You have to look at a relationship, a kind of relationship that combines all those traits, and the kind of relationship that combines them all is friendship. And so what we're going to do with tonight is look at friendship. Not that you can't have friends without a supernatural change heart, but I think we're going to see there's a kind of friendship and there are resources for friendship given to you in the gospel that are second to none.

Now, one of the most iconic, cinematic presentations of the power of friendship, it's so iconic that it's often mocked, but it's still iconic, is the second of the old Frankenstein movies with Boris Karloff, the bride of Frankenstein. There's one scene in which the monster lurches into a cottage in the middle of the forest, and there's only one person living in the cottage, an old poor blind man. And when the blind man comes to the door to meet the monster, of course he can't see him, so he's not afraid, but he does sense that he can't speak.

And so he says, are we both afflicted? I cannot see and you cannot speak. Maybe he says we could be friends.

So he brings the monster in and treats him kindly, constantly calling the friend, calling him a friend. And at one point the blind man kneels by the monster and begins to pray. And he prays, our Father, I thank thee that in thy great mercy thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness, and now out of the silence of the night has brought two of thy lonely children together and has sent me a friend to be a light to my eyes and a comfort in my time of trouble.

Amen. And the writer commenting on this part of the film says, in this incredible scene, the monster sees the hermit break down and cry at the end of the prayer. The monster sheds a tear and compassionately reaches out to comfort the crying man with a consoling pat on the back.

They both share a need for human friendship. During the prolonged fate out from the scene, a glowing Christian crucifix is the last object to vanish from view. But of course, as any of you may know, and you can always go see this on YouTube, it's up there.

What happens eventually is the villagers come to the cottage, they see the monster, they attack the cottage and they begin to set it on fire. And the last thing you see in this part of this scene is the Frankenstein monster lurching his way out of the flames and out of the smoke saying, friend, friend, pleadingly, but there's no answer. And the point is, nothing is more humanizing and nothing is more life changing than friendship.

Why? How? Take a look at this passage, which is the classic passage in all the Bible.

In fact, it's, I think in all of religious literature, a unique passage about friendship. There's nothing like it anywhere else, and here's why. First of all, it tells us the nature or character friendship.

Secondly, how you make it, how you forge friendship, and thirdly, where you get the power for it. First, the character or nature of friendship. What's intriguing about this passage, and I gave you in a sense a sample of it, is that the beginning of chapter 15, Jesus speaks about his relationship to the disciples under the metaphor of vine and branches.

He says, I'm the vine, you're the branches. And that's a metaphor that talks about relationship, right? But it's a metaphor of deep unity, because the vine and the branches share a common life.

They share a common bond. But then around verse nine or so, Jesus shifts into another metaphor. And instead of calling the branches, you are my branches, he starts calling them my friends.

But they're very tied together as we're going to see. There's actually a verb, the word remain, that he uses both when he's talking about them as branches and when he's talking about them as friends. But there's more overlap between this image of vine and branches and friends than you might think.

Because in the Bible, friends are often spoken of like this. Deuteronomy 136, almost a throwaway statement. Deuteronomy 136 says, if you have a brother, the son of your mother, or a friend who is as your own soul, if you have a friend who is as your own soul.

And then, of course, first Samuel 18, it says, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved David as his own soul. This idea of souls knit together is the biblical image of friendship. And I want you to think, what does that mean?

Souls knit together? It's more than just mental agreement. You might have a colleague you work with, and you both agree mentally, this is more than that.

And frankly, it's even more than sexual attraction. It's more than just the connection of bodies. It's more than just the connection of opinions.

Souls knit together means you have common loves, common passions, common beliefs, common interests. There's a couple of classic things you could read on this. I would go online and you'll find Ralph Walder Emerson wrote a fascinating essay on friendship.

And of course, the chapter on friendship in C. S. Lewis's book The Four Loves.

And Ralph Walder Emerson says, friends do not ask, do you love me? So much as do you see the same truth, or do you care about the same truth as I do? The typical expression of an opening friendship would be something like this.

What? You too? I thought I was the only one.

That's how friendship start. And C. S.

Lewis puts it like this, though we can have erotic love and friendship with the same person. Yet in some ways, there's nothing less like a friendship than a love affair. Lovers are always talking to one another about their love.

Friends do not usually talk about their friendship. Lovers are normally faced to face, absorbed in one another, but friends stand side by side, absorbed in some common interest. That is why those pathetic people who simply want friends can never make any.

The very condition for having friends is that you want something else besides friends. If someone asks you, do you see the same truth as I? And your honest answer is, I don't really care about the truth.

I just want you to be my friend. No real friendship can start. There would be nothing for the friendship to be about.

Those who have nothing can share nothing. Those who are going nowhere can have no fellow travelers. And what is this?

It means, basically, that friends are people that you meet that have a common interest, a common passion, a common beliefs, and you immediately fill a oneness. And that means that to begin with, friends are discovered. There's a place in Proverbs 27 that says, the counsel of a friend is pleasant.

But the actual Hebrew word means sweet. And one of the problems with understanding of actually anything in the Bible is you have to understand the original context. And in those days, you couldn't sweeten things.

Cooks couldn't do that. They didn't have sugar in the places where the Bible was being written and at that time. You could discover sweetness.

There are some foods that were naturally sweet, but cooks couldn't create sweetness. So when it talks about friendships being sweet, it's talking about not something you can create, but something you've discovered. And so the way friendships begin is, what you too, I thought I was the only one.

You like that movie? You like that music? You like that kind of book?

You too? It's common beliefs, common bond. That's the beginning.

有时根据语境，它可以被翻译得恰到好处、悦耳动听、真诚可信或充满同情。

因此，如果你要谈论善意这个词——它有这么广泛的词义范围——你不能抽象地去谈。你需要观察一种关系，这种关系结合了所有这些特质，而能够将它们全部结合在一起的关系就是友谊。所以今晚我们将探讨友谊。虽然没有神的改变之心，你也可以拥有朋友，但我认为我们会看到，在福音中赐予你的有关友谊的资源是无与伦比的。

其中一个最经典、最具电影感的友谊力量呈现，尽管它经常被嘲笑但仍非常经典的是老版《弗兰肯斯坦》中的一个场景。在第二集中，有 Boris Karloff 出演的弗兰肯斯坦新娘，在森林中的一间小屋前遇见了怪物。这间小屋里只有一个老人，他穷困且双目失明。当老人去开门迎接怪物时，当然看不见对方，所以并不害怕，但他能感觉到对方不会说话。

于是他说：“我们都是不幸的人吗？我看不到，你也说不出话来。或许我们可以成为朋友。” 然后他把怪物带进屋内，并友好地对待他，不断称呼他为朋友。

在某个时刻，老人跪下对怪物说起了祷告。他祈祷道：“我们的天父啊，感谢你在你的大怜悯中垂听了我的哀求，在这个寂静的夜晚，你让两个孤独的孩子相遇了，赐给我一个朋友来照亮我黑暗的眼睛，并在我困难的时候给予安慰。” 阿门。评论这部电影的作者说，在这一令人难以置信的场景中，当老人在祷告结束时哭了起来，怪物也流下了眼泪。

他同情地伸出手，温柔地拍了拍哭泣者的后背以示安慰。> 我们的天父啊，感谢你在你的大怜悯中垂听了我的哀求，在这个寂静的夜晚，你让两个孤独的孩子相遇了，赐给我一个朋友来照亮我黑暗的眼睛，并在我困难的时候给予安慰。他们俩都需要人类的友谊。在长时间远离人群之后，最后一眼看到的是一个闪耀着光芒的基督教十字架。

当然，你们都知道这一点，也可以随时上网查看。最终发生的事情是村民们来到小屋前，看到了怪物，开始攻击小屋并放火烧了起来。在这个场景的最后一幕，你看到的是弗兰肯斯坦怪物从火焰和烟雾中踉跄而出，喊着“朋友、朋友”，恳求着，但没有回应。这个点在于：没有什么比友谊更能体现人性，也没有什么能带来如此大的改变。

为什么？又是如何做到的呢？让我们看看这段经典经文吧，这在圣经中是关于友谊的经典段落之一，在宗教文学中也是独一无二的，原因如下： 首先，它告诉我们友谊的本质或特性。这段经文中有趣的一点在于，耶稣在第15章开头用葡萄树和枝子的比喻来描述他与门徒的关系。

他说：“我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。”这是一个关系的隐喻，但也是一个深层次统一的隐喻，因为葡萄树和枝子共享生命。它们之间有共同的纽带。但在大约第九节左右，耶稣转换了另一个比喻。

他不再称他们为“我的枝子”，而是开始称呼他们为“我的朋友”。尽管这两个形象有所区别，但其中有一个动词“remain”（留下），他在谈论他们是枝子时用了这个词，在谈论他们是朋友时也用了这个词。这两个图像——葡萄树和枝子与朋友之间——其实比你想象的还要紧密相连。因为在圣经中，朋友常常被这样描述。

在《提多书》136章，几乎是一个随手提及的陈述。《提多书》136章说：“你若有一个弟兄，是你的胞弟；或者有一个友爱你、如同自己灵魂的朋友。”然后当然，在《撒母耳记上》18章中也提到，“约拿单的心与大卫的心紧紧相联，约拿单爱大卫如同自己的灵魂。” 这个“心灵相连”的概念就是圣经中的友谊形象。

我想让你思考一下，这究竟意味着什么？心灵相连？这不仅仅是精神上的认同。你可能有一个同事，你们在思想上达成一致，但这还不止于此。

实际上，它甚至不只是性吸引。也不仅仅是身体的连接，更不是仅仅意见的一致。心灵相连意味着你们有共同的爱好、共同的热情、共同的信仰和共同的兴趣。关于这一点，有一些经典的论述你可以阅读。

我上网一查，你会发现拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生写过一篇关于友谊的精彩论文。当然，《四种爱》这本书中的“友谊”章节也是C.S.刘易斯的经典之作。拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生说：“朋友不会问你是否爱他，而是问你是否看到了同样的真理，或者关心同样的真理。”通常友谊开始的方式是这样的： 什么？

你也这样想吗？我还以为只有我一个人有这样的想法呢。这就是友谊的起点。而C.S.刘易斯则这样说：虽然我们可以对同一个人有性爱和友谊，但在某些方面，没有什么比爱情关系更不像友谊了。

恋人总是谈论彼此的爱情。朋友通常不会谈论他们的友谊。恋人通常是面对面地沉浸在对方身上，但朋友则是并肩站立，在共同的兴趣中沉浸。这就是为什么那些仅仅想要朋友的人永远无法拥有真正的朋友的原因。

拥有朋友的条件之一是你除了朋友之外还想要其他东西。如果有人问你：“你是否看到了同样的真理？”而你的诚实回答是“我不太关心这个真理”。我想让你们成为我的朋友。

**真正的友谊无法开始。那些一无所有的人，没有什么可以分享；那些无所追求的人，也没有同行者。这是**什么？这基本上意味着，朋友是你遇到的有共同兴趣、共同热情和共同信念的人，你会立刻产生共鸣。

**这意味着，首先，朋友是被发现的。**箴言27章中有句话说：“朋友的劝戒是甘甜的。” 但实际的希伯来文意思是“甜美”。理解圣经中的任何东西的一个问题就是你必须了解原始背景。

在那个时代，烹饪者无法让食物变甜。那时还没有糖，所以厨师们无法创造甜味。当谈到友谊时所说的“甜美”，指的是不是你能创造的东西，而是你能发现的东西。因此，友谊的开始是这样的：我以为我是唯一的。

你喜欢那部电影吗？喜欢那种音乐吗？喜欢那样的书？你也喜欢？

这就是共同信念和纽带的开始。

## 锻造真正的友谊 / Forging a Friendship

But it's only the beginning, because now, secondly, we need to go on to how you forge a friendship out of that beginning. Here's why you can't. When I say friends are discovered, don't take that too far, because there's always an initial sense of oneness with a person who can be a friend.

You click, you see it. And yet, you are both human beings, meaning you're both flawed and you're both different from each other. And therefore, you'll never actually get past the difficulty of embracing someone who is other than you, someone who is different than you, someone who, in spite of having some similarities, is also very different.

Embracing the other is incredibly costly. And turning a person who is a potential friend into a lifelong friend, which is one of the great things there is in life, takes work, two particular kinds of work, two particular kinds of discipline. And here's what they are.

They're both here in this classic text. Jesus, when he says, you are my friends, he shows you what the two things are, these two disciplines by which you turn would-be friends into real friends. And those two disciplines are vulnerable transparency and sacrificial loyalty.

Vulnerable transparency, which you see in verse 15 and sacrificial loyalty, which you see in verse 13. Look, first of all, vulnerable transparency. This amazing verse, you are my friends.

If you do what I mean, I no longer call you servants because the servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I've called you friends for everything I learned from my father. I have made known to you.

See, the difference between a boss and a friend. A boss says, do this. I don't have to explain myself.

That's your job. A commander says, obey my order. You don't have to explain yourself.

That's your job as you obey the commander. But he says, I'm not treating you just like that. I'm treating you as a friend.

Friends tell secrets. Friends open up. Friends let you in.

Friends show you what they're really like, what they look like without their makeup on, what they're really dealing with, how they're really feeling. There's an interesting verse in Psalms 25, verse 14. And if you look at different translations, sometimes the translation is the secret of the Lord is with those who fear him.

The secret of the Lord is with his people. But sometimes it's translated. The friendship of the Lord is with his people.

And you know why the translators can't decide? Because the same Hebrew word that means secret can also be translated friend. You know why?

Class? Because friends tell secrets. Because you're not a friend if you don't.

There's a vulnerability and there's a transparency. And you say, well, what does that mean? Well, let me go a little deeper then.

Transparency means in friendship. The ability to take and receive criticism well. Now, by the way, everybody gives and takes criticisms.

But friends are people who give and take criticism well. And that's the reason why you have verses like in Proverbs is the best place on this sort of thing. Verse 20, Proverbs 27, 6, faithful are the wounds of a friend.

That's the King James Version. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Isn't that great?

Or Proverbs 29, 5 says, if you flatter someone, you're not their friend. Because that's the worst thing for them. You're letting them live within, inflated understanding of what they can do.

It's terrible for them. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. Friends don't flatter one another.

And of course, the famous Proverbs 17, where it says, as iron, sharpens iron, pardon me, this is Proverbs 27, 17, as iron, sharpens iron, so friend, sharpens a friend. In other words, look, very often, there's something you need to hear about yourself that you don't want to hear. And you're not going to listen to it from a train counselor.

You're not going to listen to it from a family member. You're not going to listen to it from a colleague. But if you have a long time trusted friend, that you can't, in a sense, write off and shrug off as not caring about you or not knowing you.

See, friends know about you and friends care about you. They're not people that have to be with you because they're not work colleagues. They don't have to be with you because they're family.

They're friends. And very often, only long-time friends can tell you the things you most need to hear. And if you don't have a lot of long-time friends, there's all kinds of things you're never going to hear about yourself.

You're just not going to grow. So vulnerable transparency is the first thing. It's very hard.

It's a discipline that you add to a potential friend to make them into an actual friend. But then secondly, there's sacrificial loyalty. And I find most intriguing the fact, which you can see in the text, that the word remain is a word that Jesus uses, not only up when he's using the metaphor of the branches.

See, verse six, if anyone does not remain in me, he's like a branch that's thrown away. What's he saying there? He says, you know, you can't pull off branches overnight and put them back on and expect it to work.

Branches have to stay with the vine. If you take them off, they're never, they never can have that same kind of unity. But then later on, he says, I want you to remain in my love.

I want you to remain in my friendship. And what this means is friendship is about remaining, sticking with people, through thick and thin. The Psalms can profoundly shape the way you approach God.

Even Jesus relied on the Psalms to face every situation, including death. In Tim and Kathy Keller's 365 day devotional, the songs of Jesus, you'll find daily readings through the Psalms with fresh biblical insight. If you don't have a regular devotional practice, this book is a wonderful way to start.

And if you already spend time in study and prayer, then reading and praying through the Psalms can help you bring your deepest emotions and questions before God and discover a new level of intimacy with him. We'll send you Tim and Kathy Keller's devotional as our thanks for your gift to help gospel and life share the love of Jesus with more people. Request your copy today at gospelandlife.com slash give, that's gospelandlife.com slash give.

Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching. It means on the one hand, in the most practical way, friends, and this is very hard, friends make time for each other.

Especially today, making time for each other is really tough. And therefore, to even do that for somebody shows us a commitment, does it not? But more than that, it means that you stick with people, you stick with your friends even when they're difficult or even when they're going through difficulties, even when you're not getting much out of the relationship.

That's what a friend does. And that's the reason why I have these other famous proverbs about that. For example, a proverbs 17-17 that says, a friend loves it all times.

Or proverbs 18-24, there's a friend stick closer than a brother. So there it is. Hear it.

What is it, friend? Friends, always let you in. Never let you down.

Always let you in, vulnerable transparency. Never let you down, sacrificial loyalty. And by the way, 500, you can't have, therefore, 500 friends on Facebook or Myspace.

See, for example, when, I mean, I know they're called friends, but they don't fit this definition. When, when Nathan the prophet comes to David, who's whole kingdom and his spiritual destiny is, is tottering and he comes in and he says, thou art the man. Do you remember that?

It's in 2nd Samuel 12. We actually looked at this in a sermon last year. He comes in and he says, David, this is what you've done.

You have sinned. You have betrayed your kingship and so forth. Do you have a Nathan in your life who can do that?

That can't be done on Facebook. It's got to be done face to face. You'll never listen to it otherwise.

Friends, always let you in, never let you down. Are you applying this to potential friends to make them into actual friends? Now, we're not done.

但这只是开始，因为接下来**我们需要探讨如何在这一基础上锻造**真正的友谊。**为什么说朋友是**被发现的呢？不要误解这一点，因为与可能成为朋友的人初次相遇时，你确实会有一种初步的共鸣感。

你们一见如故，但同时你们都是人，意味着你们都有缺点，并且彼此不同。因此，你永远无法真正克服接纳一个不同于你、不同于你的人的困难，尽管你们在某些方面有相似之处，但在其他方面也非常不同。接纳他人是极其昂贵的。将一个潜在的朋友变成一生的朋友，这是生活中的一大美好事物，这需要付出努力，两种特定类型的努力，两种特定类型的自律。

下面就是它们。它们都在这段经典文本中有所体现。当耶稣说你们是我的朋友时，他展示了如何通过这两种纪律将潜在的朋友转变为**真正的朋友。而这两种纪律是**：脆弱的透明度和牺牲性的忠诚。

脆弱的透明度，在第15节可以看到；牺牲性的忠诚，在第13节可以看到。看，首先，脆弱的透明度。这一令人惊叹的经文说：“你们是我的朋友。” 如果你照我的意思去做，我就不再称呼你们为仆人了，因为仆人不知道主人的事。

而是称你们为朋友，因为我从我父亲那里所学到的一切都告诉了你们。看看老板和朋友之间的区别。老板会说：做这个。他不需要解释自己。

那是你的工作。指挥官会说：遵照我的命令行事。你也不需要解释自己。那是在你服从他的命令时。

但他却说：“我不是仅仅把你当作那样对待，我是把你当作朋友来对待。” 朋友会分享秘密。朋友会敞开心扉。朋友会让你走进他们的世界。

朋友会展示他们真实的面貌，卸下妆容后的样子，他们面临的实际问题，以及他们的真实感受。诗篇25章14节中有一句有趣的经文，在不同的翻译版本里，有时被译为：耶和华的密旨是与敬畏他的人同在；有时则被译为：耶和华的朋友与他的子民同在。为什么翻译者无法决定呢？因为同一个希伯来词既可以表示秘密，也可以表示朋友。

你知道为什么吗？同学们，因为朋友会分享秘密。如果你不是朋友，就不会这么做。这是一种脆弱性和透明度。

你可能会问：那意味着什么呢？让我再深入解释一下。透明意味着在友谊中敞开心扉。能够接受和给予批评的能力。

顺便说一句，每个人都会给予和接受批评。但是朋友是那些能够很好地给予和接受批评的人。因此，在箴言中有这样的经文，特别是在处理这类事情时，最好的地方就是箴言27章6节：“忠实的伤口胜过虚假的亲吻。” 这是钦定版圣经的说法。

“忠实的伤口胜过虚假的亲吻”，多好啊！或者箴言29章5节说：“谄媚邻舍的，是坑陷自己。” 因为这对他们来说是最糟糕的事情。你让他们生活在对自己能力的夸大认识中。

这对他们是极坏的影响。忠实的伤口胜过虚假的亲吻。朋友不会互相奉承。当然还有著名的箴言17章，其中说：“铁磨铁，愈见锋利”，对不起，这是箴言27章17节，“铁磨铁，友人亦然。

” 换句话说，很多时候，有些你需要听到关于自己的事情是你不想听的。你不会从心理咨询师那里听到这些。你也不会从家人或同事那里听到这些。但是如果你有一个长时间信任的朋友，他们不会轻易被你忽视，也不会让你觉得他们不在乎你或者不了解你。

朋友们了解你，关心你。他们不是因为你工作关系而必须与你在一起的人，也不是因为家庭关系而必须与你在一起的人。他们是朋友。很多时候，只有长期的朋友才能告诉你你需要听到的事情。

如果你没有很多长期的朋友，你将永远不会听到关于自己的很多事情。你也就不会成长。所以敞开心扉的透明性是第一位的，这非常困难。这是你要加在潜在朋友身上的一个纪律，使他们成为真正的朋友。

但其次，还有牺牲性的忠诚。我发现最引人入胜的是，耶稣在使用枝条的比喻时也用到了“remain”这个词。看看第六节，如果有人不留在我的里面，他就像被丢弃的枝子。他在说什么？

他说你知道，你不能一夜之间把枝子摘下来再放回去就指望它还能活。枝子必须留在葡萄树上。如果你把它摘下来，它就再也无法拥有那种统一感了。但后来他又说，我希望你们留在我的爱里。

我希望你们留在我的友谊中。**这意味着友谊就是一种坚持，是与人共度风雨的能力。**诗篇可以深刻地影响你对神的态度。即使耶稣也依靠诗篇来面对每一个情况，包括死亡。

在提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的《365日灵修》——“耶稣之歌”中，你可以每天通过诗篇获得新的属灵洞察力。如果你没有固定的灵修习惯，这本书是一个很好的开始。而如果你已经有定期研读和祷告的习惯，那么阅读并祷告诗篇可以帮助你将最深的情感和问题带到神面前，并发现与祂更深层次的亲密关系。我们将会感谢您的礼物，为您寄送提摩太和凯瑟琳·基勒的灵修书。

请访问gospelandlife.com/give获取您的副本。现在听提摩太·基勒博士继续今天的教导。从一个最实际的角度来说，朋友们，这非常艰难，朋友们要抽出时间彼此相聚。尤其是在今天，抽时间相聚真的很难。

但为了做到这一点，不是已经显示出一种承诺了吗？更重要的是，**这意味着你要与人共度难关，即使他们困难重重或正处于困境中，甚至你从中得不到太多回报时，也要坚持下去。**这就是朋友所做的。这也是为什么有这些著名的箴言来说明这一点的原因之一。

例如，箴言17章17节说：“朋友总是爱到底。”或者箴言18章24节说：“朋友比兄弟更亲密。” 就是这样。听清楚了，朋友们？

朋友是什么？朋友总是在你需要时出现。朋友从不让你失望。始终保持开放透明，脆弱而不设防。

始终如一，无私忠诚。顺便说一句，500 个朋友在 Facebook 或 MySpace 上是不行的。你看，比如，他们叫朋友，但并不符合这个定义。当拿单先知来见大卫王时，他的王国和灵命都摇摇欲坠，拿单却对他说：“你就是那人。

”你还记得吗？这发生在撒母耳记下第12章。我们去年在一次讲道中讨论过这一点。拿单来见大卫，并说：“大卫啊，这就是你的所作所为。

” 你犯了罪，背叛了自己的王权等等。你身边有这样的人吗？这种事在 Facebook 上是做不到的，必须面对面才能做到。否则你不会听进去。

朋友们，始终让你靠近，永不让你失望。你们是否将这一点应用到潜在的朋友身上，使他们成为真正的朋友呢？我们还没有结束。这里有一个原因。

## 终极的友谊之举 / The Ultimate Act of Friendship

And here's the reason why. We've looked at the nature of friendship and we've looked at its power and we've looked at it. You know, it's forging.

But where do you get the power for it? And here's what we have a lot against us. We have a lot against us.

First of all, the very idea, let's look at this, vulnerable transparency, unconditional, constancy, loyalty, frightening. It's kind of exciting to imagine people giving it to us, but it's not all that exciting. Imagine you giving it to anybody else.

Because transparency is scary and loyalty and constancy is draining. And we live in a culture that both in its messaging and in its social structure does everything to keep you from developing friends. You know that.

When you're in a place like New York, there's two kinds of relationships that are easier to happen and falling off a log. One is what I'll call the network of colleagues. There's a ton of people that you need to know.

You need to schmooze, you need to see, you need to spend time with, you need to get to know and be friendly to who are people in your work or people you need to know in order to do your work. It's your colleagues network. You got to know those people.

And you do know those people. You enjoy those people. But the purpose of those relationships is your work, career, money.

The second set of networks, the second kind of set of relationships, is your socializing network, people you party with, people you socialize with, people you have romantic interest in, or you might have romantic interest in. So here's the people you party with and the product is fun. And here's the people that you, you know, you network with and the product is a career in advancement and money.

And they happen like that, but there's no investment like this from you or in you. There's not sacrificial loyalty because the whole idea behind social, these are going to be people who are, have fun with. These are going to be people who pay off for you.

Sacrificial loyalty is not part of it. Transparency is definitely not part of it. And so you're going to starve.

You're going to be impoverished. You're not going to get the things that only friendships can give you. What are we going to do?

You need the power to overcome the natural fear, the scariness of transparency and the natural weakness that come when you consider the constancy and the loyalty of friendship. You need a power to help you overcome your fear and your weakness. Where do we get that power to be friends?

Where do we get the power to make people the friends that we should right here? Do you know that Aristotle very wisely wrote a lot about friendship, but one of the things he said is you can never be friends with a God. However you relate to God or to God, the gods, you could never be friends with the gods.

And the reason he said that was because he believed that all friendships had to be between social equals. He did not believe friendship was possible unless you had the same amount of social standing or power or education and so on. Because of course friendship is based on that discovered commonality, common interest, common loves, common passions.

And that happens to people the same culture, of the same race, of the same class, of the same education level. And therefore no way could you have a relationship with a God that was called friend. And of course by the way, I have been on panels with representatives of other religions many times over the years actually.

And whenever I even try to talk about this, that we can know God as a friend, I am told in no uncertain terms, usually respectfully, but also very strongly that that is an inappropriate way of talking about God. That in their religions God is never talked like that. That's bringing God down.

God cannot be your buddy. God can't be your pal. God can't be your friend.

And yet the Old Testament gives us hints. Exodus 33 says, God spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend. James chapter 2 says, Abraham, oh, what a great man.

And he was called the friend of God. But wait a minute, how could that be? Isn't Aristotle right?

He's a smart guy. I mean, how could God become vulnerable? Friends are vulnerable.

And how could God become loyal to you, sacrificially? That's ridiculous. No, it's not.

And you know it's not. And now you know I know other religion would dare say God could be your friend, but Christianity can and here's how. Because when God came to earth in Jesus Christ and went to the cross and died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, that was, as Jesus himself says in verse 13, the ultimate act of friendship.

The ultimate greater love has no one than this that he laid down his life for his friends. And he's not talking in general. He's talking about the fact because the next day, that's what he's going to do.

The cross is the ultimate. Listen, the cross is the ultimate act of friendship. You know how friends always let you in?

Look at the cross. How much more open could he be to you? His arms aren't just stretched open to you.

They're nailed open. How much more vulnerable and transparent do you want him to be? And friends, never let you down.

How much more faithful? How much more sacrificial? How much more loyal could he possibly be than to go to the cross?

You know when the garden gets seminary, he saw all the people that he was supposed to be securing the pardon for, all of his so-called disciples. They were betraying him. They were abandoning him.

They were falling asleep on him. They were about to deny him. And he knew that he could either go to hell for them and take everything they deserved or he could lose them and he went to hell.

There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. There is the ultimate friend who loves it all times. And there is the ultimate friend whose wounds are faithful.

Remember that proverb, faithful to the wounds of a friend? But in this case, in Jesus Christ, these aren't the wounds that the friend inflicts. These are the wounds that the friend bears for you and me.

And see, it's simple, love economics. Where do you get the power to reach out to people and to be transparent to them when you might get hurt and to be loyal to them when you might be let down? It's simple, love economics.

Look, verse 12, my command is this, love each other as I have loved you. I'm laying down my life for you. I'm pouring out my love for you.

And this is very simple. If you are an incredibly wealthy person, you're a trillionaire. And there's a couple of people around you that you like and they have some idea for an investment and the business plan is okay.

But you know, you're not totally sure about it. You're going to invest in them. Why?

Because you can afford. You like them. You want to encourage them and you can afford to lose the money.

That's exactly the way it is. If Jesus Christ friendship is the thing that just fills your heart, you can afford to open up to other people. You can afford to take a risk because all friendship is a risk.

You can afford it because you've got the ultimate friend and the ultimate love of a friend. Now look, let me give, let me apply this in three ways. Three ways.

我们已经探讨了友谊的本质和力量，并且知道它能够锻造人。但问题来了：你从哪里获得这种力量呢？我们有很多障碍。首先，让我们来看看这个概念——脆弱的透明度、无条件的忠诚与恒心。

这听起来很吓人。想象别人给予你这样的东西固然令人兴奋，但反过来想想你自己给予别人时会怎样？因为透明度让人害怕，而忠诚和恒心则消耗精力。我们生活在一个文化中，无论是信息传递还是社会结构，都在尽力阻止人们建立友谊。

你们知道这一点。当你身处像纽约这样的地方时，最容易发生的两种关系就像从树上掉下来一样容易——一种是同事网络。你需要认识很多人，需要社交、见面、了解他们，并与他们友好相处，这些人是你工作所需或为了完成工作的必要联系人。这就是你的同事网络，你必须认识这些人。

你们当然认识这些人，也喜欢这些人。但这些关系的目的在于工作、事业和金钱。第二种网络是社交圈，与之交往的人是为了娱乐、交际、浪漫兴趣或潜在的浪漫兴趣。这里有你一起聚会的朋友，产品是乐趣；这里有你结交人脉的朋友，产品是职业晋升和金钱。

这些关系确实会发生，但是没有像友谊这样的投资。没有牺牲性的忠诚，因为社交的本质就是寻找那些能带来欢乐的人。这些人会为你带来利益。牺牲性的忠诚在这里不存在，透明度也绝不是必需的。

所以你会感到饥饿，会变得贫穷。你不会得到只有真正的朋友才能给予的东西。我们该怎么办？你需要一种力量来克服对透明度的自然恐惧和在考虑友谊的恒常性和忠诚时产生的脆弱感。

你需要一种力量来帮助你克服恐惧和弱点。这种力量从哪里来？我们如何在这里建立真正的友谊呢？你知道亚里士多德非常明智地写过很多关于友谊的内容，但他曾说过，你永远不可能与神成为朋友。

无论你如何与神或诸神相处，都无法成为朋友。他这么说的原因是因为他认为所有真正意义上的友谊都必须发生在社会地位平等的人之间。他不相信除非拥有相同的社交地位、权力或教育背景等条件，否则无法建立真正的友谊。因为友谊的基础在于发现的共同点——共同的兴趣、共同的爱好和激情。

人们在同一文化、同一种族、同一阶层、同一教育水平中也会发生这样的事。因此，你根本无法与被称为朋友的上帝建立关系。顺便说一句，多年来我确实多次参与过与其他宗教代表的讨论。每当我试图谈论这一点——我们能够把上帝当作朋友来认识时，总会有人以明确但通常又是尊重的方式强烈反对这种说法，认为这是不恰当的表达方式。

在他们的宗教中，从来不会这样谈论上帝。这会让上帝显得低人一等。上帝不能成为你的密友、你的伙伴或你的朋友。然而，旧约圣经给了我们一些暗示。

出埃及记33章提到，上帝与摩西面对面交谈，如同人与朋友交谈一般。雅各书2章说，亚伯拉罕啊，他是多么伟大的人物，他被称为上帝的朋友。但等等，这怎么可能？难道亚里士多德是对的吗？

他是一个聪明的人。那么，上帝怎么会变得如此脆弱呢？朋友之间是会互相依赖的。上帝又怎么会为你献上牺牲、忠诚地爱你？

这听起来很荒谬。不，不是这样的。你知道不是这样。现在你也知道其他宗教从不敢说上帝可以成为你的朋友，但基督教却能这样做，并且这是如何做到的。

因为当上帝以耶稣基督的身份来到世间，在十字架上受难并为我们的罪而死时，正如耶稣在第13节中所说，这正是最大的友谊行为。没有人比舍己为朋友的人更伟大了。他不是泛泛而谈，因为他接下来就要这样做。十字架是终极的友谊表现。

听我说，十字架是最伟大的友谊表现。朋友们总是让你进入他们的世界。看看十字架吧，他能对你有多开放？他的双臂不仅张开迎接你，还被钉在那里。

他还想变得多么脆弱和透明呢？朋友从不背叛你。他们有多忠诚？有多献身？

有多忠心？为了去到十字架上受难，上帝已经表现出了最极致的忠诚、牺牲与忠诚。你知道当花园变得阴森时，他看到了所有本该为他求得赦免的人，也就是他所谓的门徒。他们背叛了他，抛弃了他。

他们在他的身边睡着了。他们即将否认他。他知道他要么为了他们下地狱并承担他们应得的一切，要么失去他们自己下地狱。有一个朋友比兄弟更亲密。

有一个终极的朋友，在任何时候都爱着你。还有一个终极的朋友，其伤口是忠实的。记得那句谚语：“忠实于朋友的伤痕。”但在耶稣基督这里，这些不是朋友施加的伤痕，而是他为你我所承受的伤痕。

看，这就是简单的爱经济学。当你可能受到伤害时，为什么还能向别人伸出援手、坦诚相待并忠诚以待？很简单，爱经济学。看看第12节：“我的命令就是：彼此相爱，像我爱你们的一样。

我为你们舍弃了我的生命。” 这非常简单。如果你是一个极其富有的人，一个万亿富豪。你身边有几个你喜欢的人，他们有一个投资想法，商业计划还不错。

但你知道，你并不完全确定。你会投资给他们。为什么？因为你负担得起。

你很喜欢他们，你想鼓励他们，并且你能承受失去这些钱的风险。这就是耶稣基督友谊的写照。如果你心中充满了这种友谊，你可以向别人敞开心扉，愿意冒险，因为所有友谊都是一种风险。你可以承担这份风险，因为你拥有终极的朋友和终极的友情之爱。

## 让友谊重归中心 / Bringing Friendship Back

Number one, we need to bring the idea of friendship back into the center of our relationships between people of different races and different classes and different nationalities. Aristotle was right that in general friendships only happen between people of the same race. You can see it.

People of the same class, people of the same education, you can see it because the thing that the starter fuel you might say, the raw material for friendship is a common bond, common belief, you know, common passion. But you realize what this means if you're a Christian, do you realize what resource this is? If you're a Christian and you find somebody of a radically different race, completely different class, different gender, different nationality, different politics, but they've had the same experience of Jesus Christ as you.

They have the same passion for the gospel, they have the same interest and passion for the scripture. Do you know what that means? You are capable of deep enriching friendships with people who are utterly different from you.

In other words, we need to completely show Aristotle he was wrong. This is the reason why my friend Don Carson puts it like this, the church is not made up of natural friends, it's made up of natural enemies. What binds us together is not common education, common race, common income levels, common politics, nationality, accents, jobs, or anything else of that sort.

Christians come together because they've been saved by Jesus Christ. We are a band of natural enemies turned into friends who love one another for Jesus' sake. Christian love is mutual love between social incompatibles.

Do you know what it's like to have a deep friendship with a person who is socially utterly different than you? In so enriching and it's possible. So let's bring friendship back into our relationships across the races, across the classes.

Number one, number two, we better bring friendship back into the relationships between men and women. Here's what I mean. Buy and large in this city and buy and large even in this church.

Men don't want to be friends with women. They either stay away from the women or they want to date them and they only go after the people they want to date have sex with. Now I can kind of understand staying away from women if you're a guy or only going after the ones that you're kind of romantically interested in.

If you're not a Christian but if you're a Christian you've got no excuses and I'll tell you what's wrong. If you're a bunch, here's 10 women in the room and two of them look attractive to you so you head for them, try to get a relationship going with them. Maybe one of them might actually become a friend, you know, if you're lucky.

The best thing to do is to befriend the women, befriend the Christian women around you and then if you fall in love with one, then you can actually trust that the love is strong enough to build a lifetime marriage on. Don't you dare do what you're doing which is to go after the women that you're attracted to and then maybe turn a couple of them into friends. No, go befriend women and then see whether you fall in love with any of them.

That works. I know. So we need to bring friendship back into a relationship between men and women.

This is an opportunity you've got but within a Christian community that the rest of the world does not have because it is true. It is tough to sometimes have friendships between men and women but Christianity gives you that same ability that enables you to break, have friendships that break not only through the racial cultural barriers but the gender barriers but number three. You need to bring friendship back into the center of your relationship with God.

There are lots and lots of people who are Christians and who believe in God and who obey God in general but they do not actually do what Jesus is saying and that is befriend God. Jesus says if you're my friend you will obey my commandments. You see that?

If you're my friend you will remain in me. What does that mean? Let's say he's been vulnerable to you on the cross.

He's been sacrificial to you on the cross. Now, number one, obey him. Don't just obey him when it's convenient, obey him.

You sacrifice now. You make yourself vulnerable. You go to the mat.

You unconditionally say I'm going to do what you have said. I'm going to do your will to matter whether I understand it or not, no matter whether I like it or not. Now you're starting to become a friend and then talk to him.

A quiet time, a devotional in which you read the Bible and pray should not just be getting some ideas and doing some petition. The Bible study should be listening to God, a sense that he's talking to you, speaking through his word. Prayer should be talking back to God.

Do you have a sense of his presence? Does it happen regularly? Do you make time for it?

There's nothing like it. That's what you need. Let me tell you why you need it so badly.

We're all like Frankenstein monsters. You know that. Your self-image is a bunch of stitched together contradictions.

Your father didn't like you, but this person did like you, and this person broke up with you and said these awful things, and you don't know what to believe about yourself. In some ways, you have an overinflated view of some of your abilities and other cases. You're way too remorseful and ashamed of other parts of you.

You're a Frankenstein monster. What you need is one overmastering love. One person whose love heals you says, this is who you are.

One great ultimate friend. And therefore, we're all like that Frankenstein monster who's groping through the forest saying, I know I could come into my own if I could find the ultimate friend that my heart is looking for. Well, Jesus, there he is.

Let's pray. Thank you, Father, for giving us the friendship that offering us the friendship that we most need, which is friendship with you. And then giving us the power to create friendships in our lives, which our culture does not really help us with, but your gospel empowers us to achieve.

When we pray that you would help us to build on your friendship love and with that power, shape many, many new friendships in this community, in this town, in our lives, so that we can become more and more like your son, Jesus Christ, who laid down his life for his friends. It ain't we pray. Amen.

现在让我从三个方面来应用这个道理： 首先，**我们需要将友谊的概念重新置于不同种族、阶层和国籍的人之间的关系中心。**亚里士多德说，在一般情况下，友谊只在同一种族的人之间发生。你也可以看到这一点。人们来自相同的社会阶层，接受过相同的教育，你们可以看见这一点。

友谊的燃料可能是共同的经历、共同的信仰或共同的热情。但如果你是基督徒，你是否意识到**这意味着什么？如果你是基督徒，并且发现一个在种族、社会阶层、性别、国籍、政治观点等方面完全不同的人，但他们与你有同样的耶稣基督的经历。**他们对福音有着相同的热情，对圣经也有相同的兴趣和激情。

你知道**这意味着什么吗？你们有能力与完全不同于自己的人建立深厚的友谊。**换句话说，**我们需要彻底证明亚里士多德是错的。**这就是为什么我的朋友唐·卡森这样描述：教会不是由自然的朋友组成的，而是由自然的敌人组成的。

将我们团结在一起的是共同的信仰，而不是共同的教育、种族、收入水平、政治观点、国籍、口音或任何其他类似的东西。基督徒们聚集在一起是因为他们被耶稣基督拯救了。我们是一群从敌人变成朋友的人，彼此相爱是为了耶稣的缘故。基督徒之间的爱是社会不兼容者之间相互的爱。

你知道与一个在社会上完全不同于你的人建立深厚的友谊是什么感觉吗？这种友谊是如此丰富和美好，并且它是可能的。所以让我们重新把友谊带回种族间的、阶层间的交往中。首先，其次，**我们需要把友谊带回男女之间的关系中。**

这是什么意思呢？总的来说，在这个城市，在这个教会里，大多数男性都不愿意与女性成为朋友。他们要么避开女性，要么只想追求她们，只和自己感兴趣的女性发生关系。我大概可以理解为什么有些男性会选择避开女性或只追求那些自己有浪漫兴趣的女性。

如果你不是基督徒，但你如果是基督徒的话，你就没有借口了。我会告诉你问题出在哪里。如果你是男性，在房间里有10个女性，其中有两个你觉得吸引人，于是你就去找她们，试着和她们发展关系。也许其中一个会成为你的朋友，当然，这是运气好的话。

最好的做法是与周围的女性建立友谊，特别是基督徒的女性。然后如果真的爱上了某一个，那么你就可以相信这份爱足够强大，可以用来构建一生的婚姻。不要去做你现在正在做的事情——去追求你觉得吸引人的女性，然后再试着把其中几个变成朋友。不，你应该先去结交女性朋友，看看是否会有感情产生。

这确实有效。我知道。所以**我们需要在男女之间重新建立友谊。**这是一个机会，尤其是在基督徒社区中，这是世界上其他地方所没有的机会，因为这是真的。

有时候男性和女性之间的友谊很难建立，但基督教给了你这种能力，让你能够打破种族、文化甚至性别障碍的束缚。第三点，你需要让友谊回到你与神的关系中心。有很多人是基督徒，相信上帝，并且一般都遵守上帝的教导，但他们并没有真正去做耶稣所说的——结交朋友。耶稣说：“你们如果是我的朋友，就会遵从我的命令。

”你看出来了吗？如果你是我的朋友，就要留在我的里面。这又是什么意思呢？比如说他在十字架上对你非常脆弱。

他为你做出了巨大的牺牲。首先，要听从他的教导。不要只在方便的时候听从他，而是要无条件地服从。你要付出代价。

你要变得脆弱。你要全力以赴。你无条件地说：“我会按照你说的去做，无论我是否理解它，无论我喜不喜欢。”现在你才算开始成为朋友，并且可以和他交谈了。

安静的时刻，一种灵修，在其中你阅读圣经并祷告，不应只是获取一些想法和进行祈求。圣经研读应该是聆听上帝的声音，感受到祂在对你说话，通过祂的话语与你交流。祷告则是对上帝的回答。你感觉到祂的同在了吗？

这是否成为你的日常习惯？你是否为自己留出时间？没有什么能替代它。这就是你需要它的原因。

让我告诉你为什么你如此需要它。我们每个人就像弗兰肯斯坦怪物一样。你们都知道这一点。你们对自己的形象是一堆拼凑起来的矛盾。

你的父亲不喜欢你，但另一个人却喜欢你；有人与你分手并对你说了难听的话，你不知道该相信自己什么。有时，你对自己的一些能力有过度的自信，而在其他方面则感到深深的悔恨和羞愧。你就是这样一个弗兰肯斯坦怪物。你需要一种压倒性的爱。

一个能够治愈你的、说“这就是你”的人。需要一位伟大的终极朋友。因此，我们每个人都像是在森林中摸索前行的弗兰肯斯坦怪物，心中想着如果能找到自己内心渴望的朋友，就能找到自我。耶稣，祂就是那个朋友。

让我们祷告。感谢你，天父，赐给我们最需要的友谊——与你的友谊，并赋予我们建立人际关系的能力，这正是我们的文化所无法帮助我们的地方，但你的福音却能赋予我们这种能力。当我们祈求你帮助我们在你的友谊和爱中成长，并利用这种力量塑造这个社区、这座城市以及我们生活中的许多新友谊时，我们就能越来越像你的儿子耶稣基督，祂为朋友舍弃了自己的生命。阿们。
