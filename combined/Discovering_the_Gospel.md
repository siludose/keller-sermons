## 引言与经文诵读 / Introduction and Scripture Reading

Welcome to Gospel and Life. How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King.

This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. The reading this morning is taken from the Book of One Corinthians, chapter 15, verses 1 through 11. Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preach to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.

By this gospel, you are saved if you hold firmly to the word I preach to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to seephus, and then to the 12.

After that, He appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, He appeared to me also as to one abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether then it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.

Here ends the reading. So we're looking at, for a number of weeks, we're looking at the subject of public faith. What does it mean to talk about your deepest beliefs, who you are, with others in public, who may not share your beliefs, and how do you do that in a way that's transparent, that's honest.

The same time is respectful. It promotes peace. This is something that everyone in the plural is excited and needs to learn how to do.

And we've been looking at this each week. And today you come to maybe perhaps one of the more obvious things that you have to talk about. We need to talk about if we're going to discuss this subject.

And that is what actually are the core beliefs of Christianity. You can't talk in public about Christianity, unless at some point you get down to say, well, what is it? What are the core things that Christians believe?

What do you believe in order to be a Christian? And if you're going to do that, there's no better spot in the whole Bible than here. Sure, there's other places in the Bible, but this has a special place because look, at the passage it was just read to you.

Paul says, now brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel. I preach to you that you received by this you were saved, and I had received it, and I passed it on to you, and it's a first importance of the very end, he says, so whether it's higher they, meaning the others that are apostles, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. What he is giving you is not only a gospel presentation.

He says, here's the gospel I preached to you. I received it. You believed it.

It saved you. But he's also speaking in the book of 1 Corinthians, and there's an amazing amount of consensus that 1 Corinthians was written just 20 years after the death of Jesus Christ, that it was perhaps the oldest of all the peeps of literature we have in the New Testament. And if that's the case, then when Paul talks about this is what I did before, he says, remember when I came before, I'm giving you a summary of the gospel that I received, that I gave you, that you believed, that saved you, he's talking about something that happened just a handful of years after Jesus' death.

So if you want to get down to the foundations, what is Christianity all about? What is Christianity believed? What is the irreducible core that you must believe to be a Christian and to have spiritual life?

Here it is, right here. And the reason why it's so important to keep in mind if you're doing public talking about this in public is if you're a Christian, it is so important to major in the majors. There's lots and lots of things that Christians believe and there's lots of things that different branches of Christian Christianity believe, and some of them may be very true, very dear to your heart, but you really should not press and push and talk about beliefs that a lot of other Christians don't even share.

You ought to major in the majors and hear the majors. And if you're skeptical of Christianity, it's also crucial to get straight what Christianity really is. Over the years when people talk to me about how they're skeptical, they really don't believe, and I ask them, well, what do you think Christianity teaches?

They tell me, and as gently as possible, I have to point out that that's not what Christianity teaches. I usually say something like, I don't know a single church in the whole world that believes that. And of course, I try to say it a nice tone, but since I use this illustration in the beginning and I realize, that's not very gentle is it?

No, maybe I shouldn't put it that way, but the deal is, do you really understand the Christianity you think you're rejecting? David Martin Lloyd-Jones, great British preacher, had a question that he used to ask people, that he considered a diagnostic question. It's a simple question, and he would say, do you consider yourself a Christian?

And the person would say, yes or no, he said, well, why? And if a person says, why do you think I'm a Christian? I think I'm trying hard to live according to the teachings of the Bible.

I'm trying very hard to live like Christ. I'm trying very hard to surrender and be like him. And Dr.

Lloyd-Jones says, if somebody gives an answer like that, he knows that even though that's very, very typical, very typical, that that person doesn't really understand the gospel, doesn't understand the core teachings. This is the gospel. What is it?

Well, let's just move right through it. There's actually four parts to this. The gospel is about Jesus.

It's about sin and substitution. It's about history and resurrection. And it's about astonishing, transforming grace.

欢迎来到"福音与生命"。我们如何分享真正认识耶稣意味着什么?不仅仅是把祂当作历史人物或道德教师,而是作为救主和君王。

本月,提摩太·凯勒探讨圣经向我们展示的关于公开表达信仰和分享我们在基督里所拥有的盼望。今天早上的读经选自哥林多前书第十五章第1至11节。弟兄姊妹们,我要提醒你们,我所传给你们的福音,你们领受了,又靠着站立得住。

你们若持守我所传给你们的话,就必因这福音得救;不然,你们是徒然相信了。我当日所领受又传给你们的,第一,就是基督照圣经所说,为我们的罪死了,而且埋葬了;又照圣经所说,第三天复活了,并且显给矶法看,然后显给十二使徒看。

后来一时显给五百多弟兄姊妹看,其中一大半到如今还在,却也有已经睡了的。以后显给雅各看,再显给众使徒看,末了也显给我看;我如同未到产期而生的人一般。我原是使徒中最小的,不配称为使徒,因为我从前逼迫神的教会。

然而我今日成了何等人,是蒙神的恩才成的,并且祂所赐我的恩不是徒然的。我比众使徒格外劳苦;这原不是我,乃是神的恩与我同在。不拘是我,是众使徒,我们如此传,你们也如此信了。

读经完毕。我们要花几个星期来看公开信仰这个主题。与他人在公众场合谈论你最深层的信仰、你是谁,那些可能不认同你信仰的人,你如何做到既透明又诚实,同时又尊重他人、促进和平,这是每个生活在多元社会中的人都需要学习的。

我们每周都在看这个主题。今天我们来到也许是这个主题中最显而易见的一件事。

如果我们要讨论这个主题,我们需要谈论基督教的核心信仰到底是什么。你不能在公开场合谈论基督教,除非在某个时刻你要说清楚,它到底是什么?基督徒相信的核心事物是什么?

一个人要相信什么才能成为基督徒?如果你要做到这一点,整本圣经中没有比这里更好的地方了。当然,圣经中还有其他地方,但这里有特殊的地位,因为看,刚才读给你们的这段经文。

保罗说,弟兄姊妹们,我要提醒你们我所传给你们的福音。你们领受了,因此得救,我领受了,又传给你们,这是第一要紧的。在最后,他说,不拘是我,是众使徒,我们如此传,你们也如此信了。他给你们的不仅是一个福音陈述。

他说,这是我传给你们的福音。我领受了。你们相信了。

它救了你们。但他也是在哥林多前书中讲这话,有大量共识认为哥林多前书是在耶稣基督死后仅仅20年写成的,可能是我们在新约中拥有的所有文献中最古老的。如果是这样,那么当保罗谈到这是我以前所做的,他说,记得我以前来的时候,我给你们总结了我所领受的福音,传给你们,你们相信了,它救了你们,他谈论的是发生在耶稣死后仅仅几年的事情。

所以如果你想深入了解根基,基督教到底是关于什么?基督教相信什么?成为基督徒并拥有属灵生命必须相信的不可简化的核心是什么?

就在这里,就在这里。如果你要公开谈论这个,记住这一点非常重要的原因是,如果你是基督徒,专注于主要的事情是非常重要的。基督徒相信很多很多事情,基督教不同分支相信很多事情,其中一些可能非常真实,对你的心非常宝贵,但你真的不应该强调和推动谈论很多其他基督徒甚至不认同的信仰。

你应该专注于主要的事情,听这些主要的事情。如果你对基督教持怀疑态度,弄清楚基督教真正是什么也是至关重要的。多年来,当人们和我谈论他们如何怀疑,他们真的不相信,我问他们,那你认为基督教教导什么?

他们告诉我,我尽可能温和地指出,那不是基督教所教导的。我通常会说,我不知道世界上有哪个教会相信那个。当然,我试着用友善的语气说,但既然我在开头用这个例证,我意识到,那不是很温和,是吗?

不,也许我不应该那样说,但问题是,你真的理解你认为自己在拒绝的基督教吗?大卫·马丁·劳埃德-琼斯,伟大的英国布道家,有一个他过去常问人的诊断性问题。这是个简单的问题,他会说,你认为自己是基督徒吗?

那个人会说是或否,他说,为什么?如果一个人说,你为什么认为我是基督徒?我认为我在努力按照圣经的教导生活。

我非常努力地像基督那样生活。我非常努力地顺服,像祂一样。劳埃德-琼斯博士说,如果有人给出这样的回答,他就知道,尽管这非常非常典型,非常典型,但那个人并不真正理解福音,不理解核心教义。这就是福音。它是什么?

让我们直接看。这实际上有四个部分。福音是关于耶稣的。

它是关于罪与替代的。它是关于历史与复活的。它是关于惊人的、改变人的恩典的。

## 福音是关于耶稣的 / The Gospel Is About Jesus

Just right through it. Okay, so first of all, it's about Jesus, because see, for what I received, I passed on to you as a first importance, and as soon as he begins, his summary of the gospel, he says, that Christ, and actually, everything else, in the whole paragraph, is just a set of clauses or phrases that explain Christ. They all point back to Christ.

The gospel is Christ, actually. The gospel is Jesus Christ. Now, how would that be?

Well, the word gospel, though many people understand the word gospel means joyful news. That's what the Greek word technically means. It was actually used to announce a history-changing event.

It was the word that meant, it was usually used to announce something like the carnation of a new king, the defeat of an invading army, something like that, some major news event. And if that's the core, if the core of Christian teaching is a gospel, then right away we're confronted with what makes Christianity different from all of the religions. See, all of the religions contain narratives about their founders, of course.

All of the religions tell stories and have narratives about the lives of their founders. But their founders, all the other religions, their founders are teachers not saviors. And because their teachers not saviors, their life story is not the core of the core of those religions.

The core of the core of those religions, like the five pillars of Islam or the eightfold path to enlightenment of Buddhism, the core of the core of those religions is always a set of directions about what you must do. Since the founders are teachers, the core of the core of those religions is a set of directions about what you must do. But the core of the core of Christianity is a gospel.

That's not a set of directions about what you must do. It's an account of what has been done. It's not actually advice.

Christianity is not advice about what you must do. It's news. It's news about what he has done.

And in fact, one of the most striking things about this whole passage is from verse three all the way to the end, this description of the gospel, there's nothing in here about what you must do. In fact, the gospel in here doesn't even contain that you must repent and believe. Now, of course, you must repent and believe the gospel.

If it's to be operative in your life, and he says so up in verse two, he says which you received, and you took your stand on it. But see, technically, that's a response to the gospel. It's not actually part of the gospel.

Why? Because the gospel is that nothing you can do, nothing you will do, nothing you have ever done can be the basis for your acceptance with God. It all happens to what Jesus Christ has done.

There's nothing you have done, nothing you can do, nothing you will do, nothing you do can be the basis for your acceptance with God. It all comes to what Jesus Christ has done. So even repenting and believing is an actually part of the gospel, technically, it's a response to the gospel.

And of course, the gospel brings massive changes to your life. It makes you an agent of reconciliation, injustice, and love in the world. It profoundly changes your character.

It changes the very structure of your identity. It changes the very pathways of your heart. It changes the way your heart works.

And yet, those are results of the gospel. You never find the authors of the scripture. You never find the apostles or Paul ever loading that into the gospel as if that's part of it.

No. In a sense, the gospel is Jesus Christ. It is Jesus.

---

直接看。好的,首先,它是关于耶稣的,因为看,我当日所领受又传给你们的,第一,当他开始总结福音时,他说,基督,实际上,整段话中的其他一切,只是一系列解释基督的从句或短语。它们都指向基督。

福音实际上就是基督。福音是耶稣基督。那怎么会呢?

福音这个词,虽然很多人理解福音意思是好消息。这是希腊词的技术含义。它实际上被用来宣布改变历史的事件。

这个词的意思是,它通常用来宣布像新王加冕、击败入侵军队之类的事情,某种重大新闻事件。如果那是核心,如果基督教教导的核心是福音,那么我们立即面对使基督教与所有宗教不同的东西。看,所有宗教都包含关于其创始人的叙述,当然。

所有宗教都讲述故事,有关于其创始人生平的叙述。但他们的创始人,所有其他宗教,他们的创始人是教师而不是救主。因为他们是教师而不是救主,他们的生平故事不是那些宗教的核心的核心。

那些宗教的核心的核心,像伊斯兰教的五功或佛教的八正道,那些宗教的核心的核心总是一套关于你必须做什么的指示。既然创始人是教师,那些宗教的核心的核心就是一套关于你必须做什么的指示。但基督教的核心的核心是福音。

那不是一套关于你必须做什么的指示。它是一个关于已经发生的事情的叙述。它实际上不是建议。

基督教不是关于你必须做什么的建议。它是新闻。它是关于祂已经做了什么的新闻。

事实上,这整段经文最引人注目的事情之一是,从第三节一直到最后,这段福音的描述,这里没有关于你必须做什么的内容。事实上,福音在这里甚至没有包含你必须悔改和相信。现在,当然,你必须悔改和相信福音。

如果它要在你的生命中起作用,他在第二节中就这样说了,他说你们领受了,又靠着站立得住。但看,从技术上讲,那是对福音的回应。它实际上不是福音的一部分。

为什么?因为福音是,你所能做的,你将要做的,你曾经做过的,都不能成为你被神接纳的基础。这一切都取决于耶稣基督所做的。

你所做过的,你能做的,你将要做的,都不能成为你被神接纳的基础。这一切都归于耶稣基督所做的。所以即使悔改和相信,从技术上讲实际上不是福音的一部分,它是对福音的回应。

当然,福音给你的生命带来巨大的改变。它使你成为世界上和解、公义和爱的代理人。它深刻地改变你的性格。

它改变你身份的结构本身。它改变你内心的通路。它改变你的心运作的方式。

然而,那些是福音的结果。你永远找不到圣经的作者。你永远找不到使徒或保罗把那些加载到福音中,好像那是它的一部分。

不。从某种意义上说,福音就是耶稣基督。它就是耶稣。

## 罪与替代 / Sin and Substitution

So first of all, it's about Christ. Secondly, though, it's about sin and substitution. Okay, so what's the first thing Jesus...

Oh, we're told about Jesus. It says that Christ died for our sins. Die for our sins.

The very first thing, sin and substitution. First of all, sin. The first thing that we're told about what Jesus came to do is deal with sin.

We are uninformed and we need wisdom. Yes. We are sufferers and we need help.

We need support. We need relief. Yes.

But, what we're learning here is, first of all, we're sinners needing salvation. That is to say, sin is our most fundamental human problem. And I got that takes a little bit of explanation.

He said, why is that? Well, first of all, sin means that if God created you, and if there is a God who created you and who sustains you every single second, and keeps you actually together from... You may say it's gravity.

Well, okay, where's that from? Or it's the way... It's the way, you know, the electrons stay in orbit around the nucleus.

What's keeping that together? You are being held together every second by God. If there is a God who created you and sustains you and who does all that, then you owe him everything.

Or, you owe it not to him just to pray when you're in trouble or something like that. You owe it to live for him, to live for him totally. But sin is the teaching of the Bible.

That, of course, you know this. We don't live for him. We don't live for God.

We don't live for our neighbor. We live for ourselves. We tend to live selfishly.

We've ruined the world. That's sin. But, well, see, to say he died for sin means that that's our fundamental problem.

Everything else comes from that because we're alienated from our maker. And we need... The word alienation doesn't...

You know, it's not used very much. But I want you to see how important it is. And I think I can do that by just giving you a simple illustration.

Sin means we're personally and legally alienated from our maker. There's a barrier there. And Jesus came to do something about it.

And before he can do anything else, he has to do that. So imagine you have a friend. You've been friends for a good long time.

Something changes. First, you notice your friend uses things that you give your friend without acknowledgement, without gratitude. Then it gets worse.

You find your friend lying to you, breaking promises, and then lying to you. And finally, it gets terrible. Your friend embezzles money from you because you're maybe in business together.

We're just steals from you and robs from you. And after all this comes out, your friend sits down and says, oh, can we stay friends because I really... I'll try to do better.

I'll try to live better. And I'm very sorry. And what are you going to say?

Now, you'll use your own words. And you'll use your own words. But essentially, you're going to say, hmm, we are in a state of alienation.

It's both legal and personal. Because what you're going to say is, look, I know you're sorry. I guess you're sorry.

And of course, if we're ever going to be friends again, if this state of alienation is going to go away, you will have to be sorry. But it won't be enough just to do better. What are we going to do about what you did to me?

You've robbed. There's a debt. There's a crime.

Bad things have happened. There's an injustice that has to be dealt with if we are ever going to be friends again. See?

Personal and legal. And of course, with God, it would be writ infinitely larger because you have an infinite God. Then you have an infinite debt.

You have an infinite crime. And there's a barrier. And that's the reason why Jesus could not come as a teacher.

Because teachers come and say, here's how you can be sorry and do a little better. That doesn't deal with the problem. Doesn't deal with the alienation.

Does it? Doesn't deal with the barrier. And Jesus came to deal with the barrier.

How? Substitution. This little word four is not very revealing to us because our English word four, F-O-R, covers such an enormous range of meanings.

You have to have to sit and think and reflect before you know in what way something is for something else. There's all sorts of categories. Fortunately, Greek had more prepositions that serviced.

And the preposition used here is who pair which means on behalf of in the place of. As a substitute. This is saying that Jesus Christ died on behalf of us.

He was a substitute. He died instead of us. He took what we deserve.

In other words, Jesus Christ took our place. The place we deserve to be cast out on the cross. And if we believe in Him, then we get the place that He deserved at the table in the family.

Love, child of God. Second Corinthians 5, 21, God made Him sin, who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Now, there's a lot of different metaphors that the Bible uses to try to describe what happened on the cross.

There's the language of the marketplace. Sometimes it talks about that Jesus Christ on the cross paid a price. Why?

Because sin is a debt. We just talked about that. And in the olden days, if you had a debt, you couldn't pay.

You went into slavery until you could pay it. And Jesus Christ, we're told in the Bible, is our ransom. He redeems us out of slavery.

He pays the price. And so we're liberated. So you have the language of the marketplace and sin is a debt.

Another kind of language is used to deal with the cross. It's the language of the battlefield. You know why?

Because sin is not just a debt. It's not just a legal debt. It's a powerful evil force.

It's in you and me. It makes us do things we hate. That's the reason why Paul, you know, in Romans 7 says, very often I find I'm doing the very thing I hate.

It absorbs us with ourselves and fills us with fears and fills us with all sorts of things. And we do things we don't like to do. It's a force inside.

Of course, it's a force outside. People can wrong us. And Jesus Christ comes.

And the Bible, some places talks about Jesus going to the cross to defeat the powers of evil and sin and death. And it's a terrible struggle. And he suffers horribly.

But in the end, he fights and he wins for us. So there's the language of the marketplace, the language of the battlefield. There's also the language of the law court.

The language of the law court says that sin is also a violation of a standard. And if there is a God, you want him to be against evil and injustice, don't you? You don't want God to be passive.

You don't want your God just to look on. You want him to do something about it. You want him to be judicially wrathful against evil and injustice.

But then to see if we have any evil in sin in us, then that wrath, that judicial wrath, that condemnation lies on us, but Jesus Christ comes and takes the punishment that we deserve. Now, as different as that is, there's others, there's others. But all those metaphors are wonderful because they show different aspects of the human problem and they show different wonderful aspects of the rich salvation we have.

But do you notice there's a thread running through all of them? Every single one of them. Substitution.

Jesus fights. Jesus pays. Jesus bears what we couldn't bear.

And that's the reason why John's thought in one of the best passages in all of his writings. He was an Anglican minister, British Anglican minister. He says that the concept of substitution is crucial to understand both sin and salvation.

If you want to understand the gospel, you've got to understand substitution. Because on the one hand, what is sin? It's you substituting yourself for God, putting yourself for only God deserves to be.

In charge of your own life, you didn't make yourself. But see, when you say, I'm going to call the shots of my own life, what are you saying? I'm my own maker.

I'm my own creator. When you act as if you're your own maker and your creator and your own creator, and you're not, it's kind of cosmic plagiarism, you know? And when you put yourself in that place and you're woefully under, by the way, you're woefully under qualified for the job of being Lord of your life.

Woefully under. See, sin is you substituting yourself for God. Well, salvation is God substituting himself for you, putting himself where you deserve to be.

God going to the cross and taking his own punishment. Now, sin is substitution. Very first thing out of Paul's mouth, when he's summarizing the thing that changed people's lives at the beginning of the beginning of the Christian movement, at the core of the core of all Christian beliefs.

And yeah, even though I love to run on and I want to go on, I need to stop for a little bit because this, as important as this is, as core as this is to Christianity, it flies right in the face of our culture. The idea that all people are sinners, that Jesus Christ had to go to the cross, take our punishment, a swage, propitiate is the old word, the wrath of God, satisfy the wrath of God, that just wrinkles at a hundred levels in our culture. But I would like to just briefly, therefore, deal with a couple of issues, kind of loose ends.

One is I would like to respond to the objection that this is a primitive bloodthirsty idea, this idea of Jesus Christ going to the cross, substituting himself. And I'd also like to show you that this is the most democratic egalitarian, possible doctrine. We always say the gospel changes everything, and we believe it really does.

That's why here at Gospel and Life, August is Go and Share month. Throughout August, we're inviting thousands of our listeners to take a small step in sharing the gospel with someone God has placed in your life. For those of you who make a gift to Gospel and Life this month, we'll send you two copies of making sense of God by Tim Keller.

It's a powerful resource that explores how Christianity makes emotional, cultural, and rational sense in today's world. It's our thanks for your gift, and provides a way you can do a small act to share the gospel by reading the book with a friend, giving one to a coworker, or passing on both copies to people who are exploring the Christian faith. It's a simple way to start a gospel conversation, or continue it.

To request your two copies of making sense of God, simply go to Gospel and Life.com-slash-give. Again, that's Gospel and Life.com-slash-give. Now, here's Dr.

Keller with the remainder of today's teaching.

首先,它是关于基督的。其次,它是关于罪与替代的。好的,那么关于耶稣的第一件事是什么呢?

哦,我们被告知的关于耶稣的。它说基督为我们的罪死了。为我们的罪死。

最开始的事情,罪与替代。首先,罪。我们被告知关于耶稣来要做的事情的第一件事是处理罪。

我们无知,我们需要智慧。是的。我们受苦,我们需要帮助。

我们需要支持。我们需要解脱。是的。

但是,我们在这里学到的是,首先,我们是罪人,需要救恩。也就是说,罪是我们最根本的人类问题。我得到这需要一点解释。

他说,为什么是这样?首先,罪意味着如果神创造了你,如果有一位创造你的神,每一秒都在维持你,让你实际上保持在一起,免于……你可能说是重力。

好吧,好的,那是从哪里来的?或者是方式……是方式,你知道,电子围绕原子核运转。

是什么让那保持在一起?你每一秒都被神保持在一起。如果有一位创造你、维持你、做所有这一切的神,那么你欠祂一切。

或者,你欠祂的不仅仅是在你遇到麻烦时向祂祈祷或类似的事情。你欠祂的是为祂而活,完全为祂而活。但罪是圣经的教导。

当然,你知道这个。我们不为祂而活。我们不为神而活。

我们不为邻舍而活。我们为自己而活。我们倾向于自私地生活。

我们毁了这个世界。那就是罪。但是,看,说祂为罪而死意味着那是我们的根本问题。

其他一切都源于此,因为我们与造物主疏远了。我们需要……疏远这个词不……

你知道,它不常被使用。但我想让你看到它有多重要。我认为我可以通过给你一个简单的例证来做到这一点。

罪意味着我们在个人和法律上都与造物主疏远了。那里有一道障碍。耶稣来要对此做点什么。

在祂能做任何其他事情之前,祂必须做那件事。所以想象你有一个朋友。你们做了很长时间的朋友。

有些事情改变了。首先,你注意到你的朋友使用你给你朋友的东西,没有承认,没有感激。然后情况变得更糟。

你发现你的朋友对你撒谎,违背承诺,然后对你撒谎。最后,情况变得很糟糕。你的朋友从你那里侵占钱财,因为你们可能一起做生意。

或者只是从你那里偷窃和抢劫。在所有这些暴露之后,你的朋友坐下来说,哦,我们能继续做朋友吗,因为我真的……我会努力做得更好。

我会努力活得更好。我非常抱歉。你会说什么?

现在,你会用你自己的话。你会用你自己的话。但本质上,你会说,嗯,我们处于疏远的状态。

这既是法律上的,也是个人上的。因为你要说的是,看,我知道你很抱歉。我想你很抱歉。

当然,如果我们要再次成为朋友,如果这种疏远状态要消失,你将必须抱歉。但仅仅做得更好是不够的。我们要如何处理你对我做的事?

你抢劫了。有债务。有罪行。

坏事发生了。有一个不公正必须被处理,如果我们要再次成为朋友。看?

个人的和法律的。当然,对于神来说,这会无限放大,因为你有一位无限的神。那么你就有无限的债务。

你有无限的罪行。有一道障碍。这就是为什么耶稣不能作为教师来。

因为教师来说,这是你如何能够抱歉并做得好一点。那不能解决问题。不能解决疏远。

是吗?不能解决障碍。耶稣来是要解决障碍。

怎么解决?替代。这个小词"为"对我们来说不是很能说明问题,因为我们英语中的"for"(F-O-R)涵盖了如此广泛的含义范围。

你必须坐下来思考和反思,才能知道某物以何种方式为另一物。有各种各样的类别。幸运的是,希腊语有更多的介词来服务。

这里使用的介词是"huper",意思是代表、代替。作为替代品。这是说耶稣基督代表我们而死。

祂是替代品。祂代替我们而死。祂承受了我们应得的。

换句话说,耶稣基督取代了我们的位置。我们应得被抛弃在十字架上的位置。如果我们相信祂,那么我们得到祂应得的位置,在家中的桌旁。

爱,神的儿女。哥林多后书5章21节,神使那无罪的,替我们成为罪,好叫我们在祂里面成为神的义。现在,圣经使用了许多不同的比喻来试图描述十字架上发生了什么。

有市场的语言。有时它谈到耶稣基督在十字架上付了代价。为什么?

因为罪是债务。我们刚才谈到了。在古时候,如果你有债务,你无法偿还。

你就进入奴役状态,直到你能偿还。圣经告诉我们,耶稣基督是我们的赎价。祂把我们从奴役中赎回来。

祂付了代价。所以我们得到自由。所以你有市场的语言,罪是债务。

另一种语言被用来处理十字架。这是战场的语言。你知道为什么吗?

因为罪不仅仅是债务。它不仅仅是法律债务。它是一股强大的邪恶力量。

它在你我里面。它使我们做我们憎恨的事情。这就是为什么保罗,你知道,在罗马书第7章说,我常常发现我在做我憎恨的事情。

它使我们专注于自己,充满恐惧,充满各种各样的东西。我们做我们不想做的事情。这是一股内在的力量。

当然,这也是一股外在的力量。人们可以冤枉我们。耶稣基督来。

圣经在某些地方谈到耶稣去十字架击败邪恶、罪和死亡的权势。这是一场可怕的斗争。祂遭受了可怕的痛苦。

但最后,祂为我们战斗并得胜。所以有市场的语言,战场的语言。还有法庭的语言。

法庭的语言说罪也是对标准的违反。如果有一位神,你希望祂反对邪恶和不公正,对吧?你不希望神被动。

你不希望你的神只是旁观。你希望祂对此做点什么。你希望祂对邪恶和不公正有司法上的愤怒。

但是看,如果我们里面有任何邪恶和罪,那么那愤怒,那司法上的愤怒,那定罪就在我们身上,但耶稣基督来承受了我们应得的惩罚。现在,尽管那是不同的,还有其他的,还有其他的。但所有这些比喻都很精彩,因为它们展示了人类问题的不同方面,它们展示了我们拥有的丰富救恩的不同精彩方面。

但你注意到贯穿所有这些的一条线索了吗?每一个。替代。

耶稣战斗。耶稣付代价。耶稣承受我们无法承受的。

这就是为什么约翰·斯托得在他最好的著作之一中写道。他是一位圣公会牧师,英国圣公会牧师。他说替代的概念对于理解罪和救恩都至关重要。

如果你想理解福音,你必须理解替代。因为一方面,什么是罪?是你用自己替代神,把自己放在只有神配得的位置。

掌管你自己的生命,你没有创造自己。但看,当你说,我要掌管我自己生命的决定权,你在说什么?我是我自己的创造者。

我是我自己的造物主。当你表现得好像你是你自己的创造者和造物主,而你不是,这有点像宇宙剽窃,你知道吗?当你把自己放在那个位置,顺便说一下,你对担任你生命的主这份工作完全不合格。

完全不合格。看,罪是你用自己替代神。那么,救恩是神用祂自己替代你,把祂自己放在你应得的位置。

神去十字架承受祂自己的惩罚。现在,罪是替代。当保罗总结在基督教运动开始时改变人们生命的事情,在所有基督教信仰的核心的核心时,他口中说出的最开始的事情。

是的,尽管我喜欢继续讲下去,我想继续讲,我需要停一下,因为这,尽管这很重要,尽管这是基督教的核心,它完全与我们的文化相冲突。所有人都是罪人的观念,耶稣基督必须去十字架,承受我们的惩罚,平息,这是旧词,神的愤怒,满足神的愤怒,这在我们文化的一百个层面上都令人不快。但我想简要地处理几个问题,一些松散的结尾。

一个是我想回应这样的反对意见,即这是一个原始的嗜血的观念,这个耶稣基督去十字架,替代祂自己的观念。我也想向你展示这是最民主、最平等主义的可能教义。我们总是说福音改变一切,我们真的相信它确实如此。

这就是为什么在"福音与生命"这里,八月是"去分享"月。整个八月,我们邀请成千上万的听众在与神放在你生命中的某人分享福音方面迈出一小步。对于那些本月向"福音与生命"捐赠的人,我们将寄给你两本提摩太·凯勒的《认识神》。

这是一个强大的资源,探讨基督教如何在今天的世界中在情感、文化和理性上都说得通。这是我们对你捐赠的感谢,并提供了一种你可以通过与朋友一起阅读这本书,送给同事一本,或将两本都传给正在探索基督教信仰的人来进行小小的分享福音的行动的方式。这是开始福音对话或继续对话的简单方法。

要索取你的两本《认识神》,只需访问gospelandlife.com/give。再次,那是gospelandlife.com/give。现在,这是凯勒博士今天教导的剩余部分。

## 十字架:不是原始的,而是革命性的 / The Cross: Not Primitive, But Revolutionary

So first of all, one of the charges is this whole idea that Jesus Christ goes and He has to shed His blood in order to satisfy the punishment and wrath of God. Many people say, that's just incredible.

It's just like the ancient primitive pagan terrible religions. They're all bloody with all that sacrifice stuff. J.

I. Packer in his great book, Knowing God, has a chapter in which he deals with this subject. And he brings out a perfect example of what people mean when they think about primitive pagan bloodthirsty religion.

He talks about the Iliad, Homer's Iliad. And in the Iliad, some of you know, probably from sixth grade, you know. The Greek army has taken ship to go to Troy.

Remember because Prince Paris has taken Helen away. And the general of the Greek army, which was Agamemnon, finds that they can't say, oh, why? Because of contrary wins.

Because the gods for some reason are angry at them. So Agamemnon sends for his daughter and ceremonially slaughters her as a sacrifice, malifies the hostile gods. The old word was propitiation.

He propities the wrath of the gods and then they can sail to Troy. That was the, by the way, if you learn this in sixth grade, they probably left that part out. They left it out for me when I actually started reading.

I said, why didn't they tell me the best stuff, you know. Well, people say, there we go. Oh, my word.

Here's a father who sacrifices his daughter, his child, to malify the gods, to propitiate their wrath. This is terrible. And Christianity is just like that.

It's primitive and bloodthirsty just like that. And J. R.

Packer says, no, no. Not only is it not like that, it's utterly different. Why?

And here's what he says. He says, in paganism, man propituates his gods. And religion becomes a form of commercialism and indeed of bribery.

In Christianity, however, God propities his own wrath through his own sacrificial action of love. See, as God comes in Jesus Christ and goes and he takes his own punishment, it's utterly different. It's the reverse of ancient primitive bloodthirsty religion.

Don't say that.

---

首先,其中一个指控是,耶稣基督去流祂的血以满足神的惩罚和愤怒的整个观念。许多人说,那简直令人难以置信。

就像古代原始异教可怕的宗教。它们都血腥,都有那些祭祀的东西。J.I.帕克在他的伟大著作《认识神》中有一章处理这个主题。他提出了一个完美的例子,说明人们在想到原始异教嗜血宗教时的意思。

他谈到《伊利亚特》,荷马的《伊利亚特》。在《伊利亚特》中,你们有些人知道,可能从六年级就知道。希腊军队乘船去特洛伊。

记得因为帕里斯王子带走了海伦。希腊军队的将军阿伽门农发现他们不能出航,哦,为什么?因为逆风。

因为诸神由于某种原因对他们生气。所以阿伽门农派人去接他的女儿,并作为祭品仪式性地杀死她,安抚敌对的众神。旧词是平息。

他平息了众神的愤怒,然后他们就能航向特洛伊。顺便说一下,如果你在六年级学到这个,他们可能略去了那部分。他们对我略去了,当我真正开始阅读时。

我说,为什么他们不告诉我最精彩的部分,你知道。好吧,人们说,就是这样。哦,我的天。

这是一个父亲牺牲他的女儿,他的孩子,来安抚众神,平息他们的愤怒。这太可怕了。基督教就像那样。

它像那样原始和嗜血。J.I.帕克说,不,不。它不仅不像那样,而且完全不同。为什么?

他是这样说的。他说,在异教中,人平息他的众神。宗教成为一种商业主义的形式,实际上是贿赂。

然而在基督教中,神通过祂自己牺牲的爱的行动平息祂自己的愤怒。看,当神在耶稣基督里来,去承受祂自己的惩罚时,这完全不同。它与古代原始嗜血宗教相反。

不要那样说。

## 最平等主义的教义 / The Most Egalitarian Doctrine

Now, secondly, I'd like to say something on the contrary about this doctrine of substitutionism. It's radically egalitarian and democratic.

And if you think, you say, boy, that's kind of weird. I want you to look at the little word in here right in the beginning of the gospel presentation, where Paul says Christ died for our sins. You know what's so interesting about that?

There's a world of meaning in that. Paul did not say for your sins. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews.

Paul tells us about what an incredibly fastidious, godly religious person he was. He poured over the Bible and he tried to find anything the Bible says that we should do. And he did everything he possibly could in order to comply with every single aspect of God's law.

And did everything he could. And yet here he is saying what? That Jesus Christ substituted himself and died for our sins, meaning I deserve to die too.

My record deserves death. Now, if that seems absolutely inexplicable to you, you need to read the book of Romans chapters one, two, and three, where he, in a very top level summary of that. He spends one chapter talking about the pagans.

Yes, the Gentiles, the people who didn't believe the Bible, and they don't follow the biblical rules of chastity and purity and integrity and so on. But then he turns to people who believe the Bible. And he shows that though externally, they're obeying the Bible inside their motivation is not for love of God, but for love of self.

Inside their self-righteousness, there's pride. And he gets to chapter three, and he says, therefore, all have sinned and falls short of the glory of God. And he says, no one is righteous, no not one.

No one is really even seeking for God. It's an amazing statement. Because here's what Paul is saying.

Paul is saying, the people that all of my life I was taught to despise, the Gentiles, the people that I wouldn't even want to eat with, because they're unclean. They don't follow the Bible. The people that I've always despised, now I'm spending my whole life with.

I'm spending my whole life with them. Why? Because we're not really any different.

He says, I'm really no better than a criminal that slits people's throats and takes their money. In the end, though, of course, we're lost in different ways. In the end, though, we violate the law of God in different ways.

In the end, we all fail to love God without our hard soul strength and our neighbors ourselves in different ways. And therefore, we're all equally sinners. We're all equally lost and we're all equally in need of God's grace.

That is the most radically egalitarian humanizing doctrine there is. Look at Paul. What turned him from a self-righteous racist into a person who embraces all people as his equals ought to say what?

It was the gospel. It humanized him. Because every other religion and philosophy says this is what you must do to get saved.

This is what you must do to find God. This is what you must do to save the world. This is what you must do in order to be a good person or a moral person.

In which case, there's always a bunch of people over here not doing what you think should be done. And therefore, you have to say, oh, look, they're not doing this. But see, Paul says it doesn't matter.

Liberal conservative, moral immoral, you know, avant-garde, respectable. This race, that race, it doesn't matter. We're all sinners.

We're all in need of grace. How radically humanizing that is. How radically egalitarian that is.

You know why? Because we're all the problem with this world. You can't look in every, I think every other philosophy I know.

Every other political platform I know. Every other religion I know basically says we know what we should be doing. And these people over here are the problem with the world.

And of course, Paul says, no, no, no, no. We're all the problem. You know, Agatha Christie's novel, Murder on the Orient Express.

It's her detective, Paul Rowe. It's stuck on a train, stuck in a snow drift. And a man is murdered.

And he's trying to figure out who was the murderer. And he's on the train with 12 other passengers. So which of the 12 has done the murder?

So he's trying to figure it out. And this is the hardest one he's ever seen. Because all the clues are pointing in different ways.

And he realizes he's missing something. He's missing something. What is the key insight that will make sense of everything?

What is the key insight that will make sense of everything? Well, the surprise answer, and I'm going to tell you. And if anybody complains about spoilers, I want you to know that this book has been out for 80 years.

And if you haven't read it or seen it, I don't want to hear it. You know what the key insight is? Everybody done it.

All 12 people murdered the man together. And suddenly everything makes sense. They're all the villains.

They're all the murders. They're all in it. Okay.

This is the clue the Gospel gives you, without which your life won't make sense. Society won't make sense. And history won't make sense.

We're all in it. We're all in it. No one is right.

Just no not one. Most democratic, egalitarian doctrine. Okay, now thirdly.

现在,其次,我想说一些与这个替代论教义相反的东西。它是激进的平等主义和民主的。

如果你认为,你说,天哪,那有点奇怪。我想让你看看这里开头福音陈述中的这个小词,保罗说基督为我们的罪死了。你知道那有什么有趣吗?

那里面有一个世界的意义。保罗没有说为你们的罪。保罗是希伯来人中的希伯来人。

保罗告诉我们他是一个多么令人难以置信的谨慎、虔诚、宗教的人。他钻研圣经,他试图找到圣经说我们应该做的任何事情。他尽一切可能去遵守神律法的每一个方面。

他尽了一切努力。然而他在这里说什么?耶稣基督替代祂自己,为我们的罪死了,意思是我也配得死。

我的记录配得死。现在,如果这对你来说似乎完全无法理解,你需要读罗马书第一、二、三章,他在那里做了一个非常高层次的总结。他花一章谈论异教徒。

是的,外邦人,那些不相信圣经的人,他们不遵守圣经关于贞洁、纯洁、正直等等的规则。但然后他转向相信圣经的人。他表明尽管外在上,他们在遵守圣经,但内在的动机不是出于对神的爱,而是出于对自我的爱。

在他们的自义里面,有骄傲。他到了第三章,说,因为世人都犯了罪,亏缺了神的荣耀。他说,没有义人,连一个也没有。

没有人真正在寻求神。这是一个惊人的陈述。因为保罗在这里说的是什么。

保罗说,我一生都被教导要蔑视的那些人,外邦人,那些我甚至不想与之同席吃饭的人,因为他们不洁净。他们不遵守圣经。我一直蔑视的那些人,现在我把整个生命都花在他们身上。

我把整个生命都花在他们身上。为什么?因为我们真的没有什么不同。

他说,我真的不比一个割人喉咙抢人钱的罪犯好。最终,虽然,当然,我们以不同的方式迷失。最终,虽然我们以不同的方式违反神的律法。

最终,我们都未能全心、全性、全力爱神和爱人如己,以不同的方式。因此,我们都同样是罪人。我们都同样迷失,我们都同样需要神的恩典。

这是最激进的平等主义、人性化的教义。看保罗。是什么把他从一个自义的种族主义者变成一个拥抱所有人作为平等者的人,应该说什么?

是福音。它使他人性化。因为其他所有宗教和哲学都说这是你必须做的才能得救。

这是你必须做的才能找到神。这是你必须做的才能拯救世界。这是你必须做的才能成为一个好人或道德的人。

在这种情况下,总有一群人在这里没有做你认为应该做的事。因此,你必须说,哦,看,他们没有做这个。但看,保罗说没关系。

自由派保守派,道德不道德,你知道,前卫的,体面的。这个种族,那个种族,都没关系。我们都是罪人。

我们都需要恩典。那是多么激进的人性化。那是多么激进的平等主义。

你知道为什么吗?因为我们都是这个世界的问题。你不能看……我认为我知道的其他所有哲学。

我知道的其他所有政治纲领。我知道的其他所有宗教基本上都说我们知道我们应该做什么。这些人是世界的问题。

当然,保罗说,不,不,不,不。我们都是问题。你知道,阿加莎·克里斯蒂的小说《东方快车谋杀案》。

她的侦探波洛。被困在一列火车上,困在雪堆里。一个人被谋杀了。

他试图找出谁是凶手。他和另外12名乘客在火车上。那么12人中哪一个犯了谋杀?

所以他试图找出来。这是他见过的最难的案子。因为所有线索都指向不同的方向。

他意识到他遗漏了什么。他遗漏了什么。什么是能让一切都说得通的关键洞见?

什么是能让一切都说得通的关键洞见?好吧,令人惊讶的答案,我要告诉你。如果有人抱怨剧透,我想让你知道这本书已经出版80年了。

如果你还没有读过或看过,我不想听。你知道关键洞见是什么吗?每个人都做了。

所有12个人一起谋杀了那个人。突然一切都说得通了。他们都是恶棍。

他们都是凶手。他们都参与其中。好的。

这是福音给你的线索,没有它,你的生活不会说得通。社会不会说得通。历史不会说得通。

我们都参与其中。我们都参与其中。没有人是对的。

连一个也没有。最民主、最平等主义的教义。好的,现在第三。

## 历史与复活 / History and the Resurrection

The third part of this Gospel presentation is the longest, but it doesn't mean it necessarily is more important than the others. In some ways it's probably long. It's about the resurrection of Jesus.

It's probably longer because it's setting up the fact that the rest of the chapter is going to be a lengthy, wonderful, remarkable treatment of the doctor of the resurrection because it was an issue in the Corinthian church. But the point is he is now saying the third part is of the Gospel is history and the resurrection. He says that Christ died for sins according to the Scriptures.

He was buried. He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. He appeared to seephus, that's Peter, then the twelve apostles after that he appeared in more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me and he's saying almost as if he had to come back and make a special trip like I was born at the wrong time.

But he even appeared to me. Now what's he talking about? The resurrection.

Why does the resurrection of Jesus Christ play an important role in the Gospel? It plays an important role because it's crucial to both, it's crucial in that the resurrection of Jesus usures and secures are past and are future salvation. First of all, it usures and secures are past salvation.

How do you know that Jesus dies on the cross actually paid for sins? How do you know it actually defeated sin? How do you know that the punishment was taken?

How do you know it's all paid? So that if you believe in him, there's no more condemnation for there. How do you know?

Well see, if somebody was in debt in those days, they were either in slavery or maybe they'd be in prison. And the only way you knew that the debt had been paid. And the way you could be sure you knew that debt had been paid was when they were released, when they were sprung.

Then you knew that the debt had been paid. And of course, the wages of sin is death. And when Jesus Christ was sprung from death and he burst the bands of death, that's proof that it was paid.

That's proof that it was paid. If you're shopping in a store and you have a bag with some things you've already purchased, there's nothing more unfortunate and kind of unpleasant than to have some plain clothesmen come up and say, have you really bought those things? Let me look inside your bag.

And you're irritated and you're feeling very bad, but what do you do? What you do is you reach in and you pull out what? The receipt and you say, trouble me not.

You say, be gone. Why? This is proof that your accusation has no merit.

Do you know how to do that with a resurrection if you're a Christian? Have you learned to do that yet? When your conscience goes after you, you've failed, you've done something really, really bad and it's killing you.

Are you a Christian? Have you believed in Jesus Christ? Your conscience is killing.

Do you know how to get out the resurrection and say, to your conscience, trouble me not? Be gone. This is my receipt.

This proves that it was paid in full. This proves this stamps paid in full across history in such a way that nobody is ever going to miss it. Do you know how to do that?

---

这个福音陈述的第三部分是最长的,但这并不意味着它必然比其他部分更重要。在某些方面,它可能很长。它是关于耶稣的复活。

它可能更长,因为它为这一章的其余部分奠定了基础,那将是对复活教义的冗长、精彩、非凡的处理,因为这在哥林多教会是一个问题。但重点是他现在说福音的第三部分是历史和复活。他说基督照圣经所说为罪死了。

祂被埋葬了。祂照圣经所说第三天复活了。祂显给矶法看,就是彼得,然后显给十二使徒看,后来一时显给五百多弟兄姊妹看,其中一大半到如今还在,然后显给雅各看,再显给众使徒看,末了也显给我看,他说好像祂不得不特地回来一趟,好像我生不逢时。

但祂甚至向我显现。现在他在说什么?复活。

为什么耶稣基督的复活在福音中扮演重要角色?它扮演重要角色,因为它对两者都至关重要,它对于确保我们过去和未来的救恩都至关重要。首先,它确保我们过去的救恩。

你怎么知道耶稣在十字架上的死实际上为罪付了代价?你怎么知道它实际上击败了罪?你怎么知道惩罚被承受了?

你怎么知道一切都付清了?所以如果你相信祂,就不再有定罪了。你怎么知道?

好吧看,如果有人在那些日子欠债,他们要么在奴役中,要么可能在监狱里。你知道债务已经付清的唯一方法。你能确定你知道债务已经付清的方式是当他们被释放时,当他们被放出来时。

那时你就知道债务已经付清了。当然,罪的工价就是死。当耶稣基督从死里释放,祂冲破死亡的捆绑时,那就是证明它已经付清了。

那就是证明它已经付清了。如果你在商店购物,你有一个袋子装着一些你已经购买的东西,没有什么比便衣警察走过来说,你真的买了那些东西吗?让我看看你的袋子里面,更不幸和不愉快的了。

你很恼火,你感觉很糟糕,但你做什么?你做的是你伸手拿出什么?收据,你说,不要烦我。

你说,走开。为什么?这是证明你的指控毫无根据。

如果你是基督徒,你知道如何用复活做那个吗?你已经学会这样做了吗?当你的良心追着你,你失败了,你做了一些真的非常非常糟糕的事情,它在杀死你。

你是基督徒吗?你相信了耶稣基督吗?你的良心在杀你。

你知道如何拿出复活对你的良心说,不要烦我吗?走开。这是我的收据。

这证明它已经全额付清。这证明这在历史上盖上了全额付清的印章,以至于没有人会错过它。你知道如何做那个吗?

## 复活确保我们的未来 / The Resurrection Secures Our Future

So on the one hand, the resurrection assures and secures you, your past salvation, but then secondly, it assures and secures the future salvation because our future salvation is not just being forgiven and going and living in heaven as a soul. Our future is a resurrected body and a new heavens and a new earth and a place without suffering and death. Do you know what that's going to be like?

What are our Tolkien in an essay called on fairy stories? Try us to help us understand why we so love fairy tales or science fiction or what we call fantasy tales. We read them all the time.

We watch them. We turn them into blockbuster pictures year after year after year. And then there you have magic and you have fantasy.

And he's trying to understand why in the world, especially in our modern age when we're very secular, we're very scientific, and we know these stories are fiction. Why we still pour into the movie theater, we read the books, and we find ourselves moved. And he says, here's why, because these stories show us some things.

They depict things that we long for, that we can't stop longing for. And here's what some of them are. He says, we long for the ability to step outside of time.

The idea of being able to step outside of time fascinates us. Secondly, we long for escape from death. Thirdly, we long for love without parting.

Love that doesn't end. It doesn't end with love without parting. Fourthly, we long.

We're fascinated by the idea of having communication with non-human beings. And then lastly, he says, we actually, of course, long for a final defeat of evil. And so whenever we see these kinds of stories, they just fasten us.

We can never get enough of them because it scratches where we itch. We have this incredible longing for these things. But do you know that if the resurrection of Jesus Christ really happened and if you believe in Him, all those things are actually literally going to come true?

They're literally going to come true. And look, if you are skeptical of Christianity, okay, you're skeptical of Christianity, but why wouldn't you want that to be true? If you don't want that to be true, you're not being honest with yourself.

And Christianity promises it. More than promises it. Essentially, it demonstrates it.

It essentially proves it with a resurrection. And that's the reason why he does all this. Why is he going on?

He was seen by Seefus. He was seen by the 12th. He was seen by 500 people who are still, most of whom are still alive.

Richard Bauchem in his great book, Jesus and the eyewitnesses, points out that these are footnotes. See, if you're writing a serious academic work today, especially historical work, you have to have footnotes. Why?

Because your footnote basically says, here's how you can find out that what I'm saying is right. So, for example, if you say, in such and such and such and such, this happened. Well, what you do is you footnote the historical register in this particular library where the original letter is or something like that.

He says, footnotes are ways for you to say to the reader what I'm saying is true and the footnote is a source from which you can find out that what I'm telling you is true. But see, in those days, if you're writing not legend, but history, how did you do a footnote? You said, here are the witnesses who are alive who saw it, you can go check.

These are footnotes. These are sources. And Paul was saying, there's hundreds of people who saw Jesus with their own eyes.

Go talk to them. Most of them are still alive. There's only 20 years later at this point.

Do you see what that means? Paul is saying, the resurrection was not a symbol. It's not a nice story.

It's not a legend. It's come down to us through the ages. People saw him.

There is evidence. And if that's the case and the stuff that you most long for in life, the kind of world you most long for is available. It's there.

---

所以一方面,复活确保你,你过去的救恩,但其次,它确保未来的救恩,因为我们未来的救恩不仅仅是被赦免,作为灵魂去天堂生活。我们的未来是一个复活的身体和一个新天新地和一个没有苦难和死亡的地方。你知道那会是什么样子吗?

托尔金在一篇名为《论童话故事》的文章中尝试帮助我们理解为什么我们如此热爱童话故事或科幻小说或我们称之为奇幻故事。我们一直在读它们。

我们看它们。我们年复一年地把它们变成大片。然后那里有魔法,你有幻想。

他试图理解为什么在我们这个非常世俗、非常科学的现代时代,我们知道这些故事是虚构的,为什么我们仍然涌入电影院,我们读这些书,我们发现自己被感动。他说,这是为什么,因为这些故事向我们展示了一些东西。

它们描绘了我们渴望的东西,我们无法停止渴望的东西。这是其中一些。他说,我们渴望能够走出时间之外。

能够走出时间之外的想法让我们着迷。其次,我们渴望逃脱死亡。第三,我们渴望没有分离的爱。

不会结束的爱。它不会结束,没有分离的爱。第四,我们渴望。

我们被与非人类生物交流的想法所吸引。最后,他说,我们实际上,当然,渴望邪恶的最终失败。所以每当我们看到这类故事,它们就吸引我们。

我们永远看不够,因为它挠到了我们痒的地方。我们对这些事情有难以置信的渴望。但你知道如果耶稣基督的复活真的发生了,如果你相信祂,所有这些事情实际上会字面上成真吗?

它们会字面上成真。看,如果你对基督教持怀疑态度,好的,你对基督教持怀疑态度,但你为什么不希望那是真的呢?如果你不希望那是真的,你对自己不诚实。

基督教应许它。不仅仅是应许它。本质上,它证明了它。

它本质上用复活证明了它。这就是为什么他做所有这些。为什么他继续说?

祂被矶法看见。祂被十二使徒看见。祂被500人看见,其中大多数还活着。

理查德·鲍克汉姆在他的伟大著作《耶稣与目击者》中指出,这些是脚注。看,如果你今天在写一部严肃的学术作品,特别是历史作品,你必须有脚注。为什么?

因为你的脚注基本上说,这是你如何能发现我所说的是对的。所以,例如,如果你说,在某某某某,这发生了。你做的是你脚注某个图书馆的历史登记册,那里有原始信件或类似的东西。

他说,脚注是你向读者说我所说的是真的的方式,脚注是一个来源,你可以从中发现我告诉你的是真的。但看,在那些日子,如果你写的不是传说,而是历史,你如何做脚注?你说,这是看见它的还活着的见证人,你可以去查证。

这些是脚注。这些是来源。保罗说,有数百人亲眼看见了耶稣。

去和他们谈谈。他们大多数还活着。这时只有20年后。

你看那意味着什么吗?保罗说,复活不是一个象征。它不是一个美好的故事。

它不是一个传说。它通过时代传承下来。人们看见了祂。

有证据。如果是这样,你生命中最渴望的东西,你最渴望的那种世界是可以得到的。它在那里。

## 改变人的恩典 / Grace That Transforms

Believe the gospel. Look, at the very, very end. This ending is technically a testimony and is wonderful.

Because see, the gospel ultimately is personal. It's not just a set up bullet points. And he says, for I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.

But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than them all.

Yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Look at three things, as we just said. First of all, this is the gospels about grace.

Notice three times he uses the word. The gospel is about grace, grace, grace. The reason my Lloyd Jones could use that diagnostic question and say to people, are you a Christian?

And if they said, well, I'm trying, trying very hard, the reason he knew that they didn't understand the core of Christianity was because they didn't understand grace. They're basically saying, well, if I work hard enough, then maybe God will bless me. Oh, my word.

Do you, John Bunion, who wrote Pilgrim's progress in his autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Truth, to the chief of sinners, tells a story of how he probably got converted. He had been reading the Bible, and it just made him feel more guilty. But he said, one day, he just thought of something.

And he says in here, he says, one day, as I was passing through a field, suddenly I thought of a sentence, a sentence. Your righteousness is in heaven. And he explains how then, with the eyes of faith, putting together things he'd read in the Bible, he says, with the eyes of faith, I saw Christ sitting at God's right hand, and suddenly I realized, there's my righteousness.

God could not say, where is your righteousness today, for it was always right in front of him. My good frame of heart could not make my righteousness better, nor a bad frame of heart, make my righteousness worse. My righteousness was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.

And now my chains fell off indeed. I felt delivered from slavery to guilt and fears, and I saw that all those weak character qualities in my heart were like the pennies that a rich man carries in his pocket when his goal is safe in a trunk at home. Grace, get grace until the grace penny drops you haven't got the gospel.

Secondly, however, grace does not mean, okay, well, you're just accepted. That's all there is to it, doesn't change you, of course it changes you, because he says, what? His grace to me was not without effect.

Boy, and that is the understatement of the year. Because what he says is, I hated Christianity, and what he doesn't say is, I'm a brilliant man. See, Paul is one of the most influential people in the history of the world.

He was brilliant, and he hated Christianity, and yet Grace changed him. Well, how can Grace change you? Well, because Grace is undeserved, once you realize that God's grace is undeserved, it humbles you.

But then when you also realize that Grace is unconditional, because it's undeserved, it takes you down. I'm no different than anybody else, but because it's unconditional, it brings you back up. I'm always accepted, I'm always loved, peace, boldness, but because it was costly, it's absolutely free to you, God's grace.

But it's infinitely costly to him, because of what he had to go through on the cross. It turns you into a sacrificial lover of other people. It was not without effect, it was not without effect.

相信福音。看,在最最后。这个结尾从技术上讲是一个见证,非常精彩。

因为看,福音最终是个人的。它不仅仅是一组要点。他说,我原是使徒中最小的,不配称为使徒,因为我从前逼迫神的教会。

然而我今日成了何等人,是蒙神的恩才成的。并且祂所赐我的恩不是徒然的。我比众使徒格外劳苦。

这原不是我,乃是神的恩与我同在。看三件事,正如我们刚才说的。首先,这福音是关于恩典的。

注意他三次使用这个词。福音是关于恩典、恩典、恩典。劳埃德-琼斯能使用那个诊断性问题对人们说,你是基督徒吗?

如果他们说,嗯,我在努力,非常努力地努力,他知道他们不理解基督教核心的原因是因为他们不理解恩典。他们基本上在说,嗯,如果我足够努力工作,那么也许神会祝福我。哦,我的天。

约翰·班扬,写《天路历程》的人,在他的自传《恩典向罪魁显多》中讲述了他可能如何得救的故事。他一直在读圣经,这只是让他感到更内疚。但他说,有一天,他只是想到了一件事。

他在这里说,他说,有一天,当我走过一片田野时,突然我想到了一句话,一句话。你的义在天上。他解释说,然后,用信心的眼睛,把他在圣经中读到的东西放在一起,他说,用信心的眼睛,我看见基督坐在神的右边,突然我意识到,那是我的义。

神不能说,你的义今天在哪里,因为它总是在祂面前。我良好的心态不能使我的义更好,也不能糟糕的心态使我的义更差。我的义是耶稣基督,昨日、今日、直到永远都一样。

现在我的锁链真的脱落了。我感到从内疚和恐惧的奴役中得到释放,我看到我心中所有那些软弱的性格品质就像富人口袋里携带的便士,而他的金子安全地放在家里的箱子里。恩典,得到恩典,直到恩典的便士掉落,你还没有得到福音。

其次,然而,恩典并不意味着,好的,好吧,你只是被接纳了。就这样,不改变你,当然它改变你,因为他说什么?祂所赐我的恩不是徒然的。

天哪,那是年度轻描淡写。因为他说的是,我憎恨基督教,他没说的是,我是个聪明人。看,保罗是世界历史上最有影响力的人之一。

他很聪明,他憎恨基督教,然而恩典改变了他。那么恩典如何能改变你?那么,因为恩典是不配得的,一旦你意识到神的恩典是不配得的,它使你谦卑。

但当你也意识到恩典是无条件的,因为它是不配得的,它把你降下来。我与其他任何人没有什么不同,但因为它是无条件的,它把你带回来。我总是被接纳,我总是被爱,平安,勇敢,但因为它是昂贵的,它对你来说是绝对免费的,神的恩典。

但对祂来说是无限昂贵的,因为祂在十字架上必须经历的。它把你变成其他人的牺牲性爱者。它不是徒然的,它不是徒然的。

## 恩典的奇妙 / The Wonder of Grace

And lastly, it just fills you with wonder. You see, he's almost, I just kind of amazed at himself. He's just looking at me saying, but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

When you say something, when you, you know, Kathy pointed out to me that this week in the Tuesday of Science Times of the New York Times, it talks about the fact that we're probably on the verge of finding a cure for hep C, which is a disease, by the way, that kills more people than AIDS. It just gives you a miserable life while it's killing you. And it looks like possibly, they went to pains to say it's not for certain, but it looks like there's not just a vaccine, but a pill, just a pill, not even a vaccine, that you take, and it can take it out of your body in a couple of months.

And of course, everybody who's hearing about it, they're just excited, they're astounded, they're amazed, they're telling each other, they're rushing. Of course, you're going to be like that. Of course, you're going to be like, think of the joy of knowing that the death sentence that was over you is taken away.

Or are you going to tell everybody about it? Aren't you going to be amazed? Well, listen, the gospel would be way more than that.

We're talking about not just extending your life a few years. We're talking about love without parting, escape from death, communication with non-human beings. We're talking about everything you've ever wanted.

How could you not be filled with joy? How could you not want to tell people that it's praying? Our Father, we thank you for the gospel.

We thank you for the glad, joyful tidings of the gospel. And we ask that the undeservedness, the unconditional nature of it, the costliness of it, would change us the way it changed Paul, humbling us, empowering us, melting us, tenderizing us, humanizing us. Oh, Father, forgive us for not walking in a manner worthy of the gospel, which means we're just not thinking, just not thinking until the power of it just begins to change us.

And we ask that you would also teach us how to wincently tell people that we found the cure. We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

Thanks for listening to today's teaching. It's our prayer that you were encouraged by it, and that it helps you apply the gospel to your life, and share it with others. As you may know, August is Goen's share month at gospel and life.

We believe God uses small acts to do great things. If you've already taken a step, maybe you've shared a resource or started praying for someone, we'd love to know. You can encourage others by marking your location on our Goen's share map.

Just go to gospelandlife.com slash share and let us know you've participated. Today's sermon was recorded in 2013. The sermons and talks you hear on the gospel and life podcast were recorded between 1989 and 2017, while Dr.

Keller was senior pastor at Redeemer Presbyterian Church.

最后,它只是让你充满惊奇。你看,他几乎,我只是对自己有点惊讶。他只是看着我说,然而我今日成了何等人,是蒙神的恩才成的。

当你说某事,当你,你知道,凯西本周向我指出,在《纽约时报》周二的科学版上,谈到我们可能即将找到丙型肝炎的治疗方法,顺便说一下,那是一种比艾滋病杀死更多人的疾病。它在杀死你的同时给你悲惨的生活。看起来可能,他们费尽心思说这不确定,但看起来不仅有疫苗,而且有一种药丸,只是一种药丸,甚至不是疫苗,你服用它,它可以在几个月内把它从你的身体中清除。

当然,每个听到这个的人,他们都很兴奋,他们很惊讶,他们很惊奇,他们互相告诉,他们涌向。当然,你会那样。当然,你会那样,想想知道你身上的死刑判决被解除的喜悦。

或者你会告诉每个人吗?你不会惊奇吗?好吧,听着,福音远不止那个。

我们谈论的不仅仅是延长你的生命几年。我们谈论的是没有分离的爱,逃脱死亡,与非人类生物的交流。我们谈论的是你曾经想要的一切。

你怎么能不充满喜悦?你怎么能不想告诉人们它在祈祷?我们的父,我们为福音感谢你。

我们为福音的欢乐喜讯感谢你。我们祈求它的不配得性,它的无条件性,它的昂贵性,会像改变保罗那样改变我们,使我们谦卑,给我们力量,融化我们,使我们温柔,使我们人性化。哦,父啊,原谅我们没有以配得福音的方式行事,这意味着我们只是没有思考,只是没有思考,直到它的力量开始改变我们。

我们祈求你也教导我们如何真诚地告诉人们我们找到了治疗方法。我们奉耶稣的名祈祷。阿门。

感谢收听今天的教导。我们祈祷你受到鼓励,它帮助你将福音应用到你的生活中,并与他人分享。如你所知,八月是"福音与生命"的"去分享"月。
