## 最好礼物的三个特质 / Three Qualities of the Best Gifts

Now I'd like to just point out three things, just point out three things that gifts are, and therefore Jesus is.

And by thinking about Jesus as a gift, I think we'll come to understand better who he is and how we should relate to him. Now first of all, now I'm not saying all gifts have these three qualities, but the best gifts do. And therefore what's essential to being a gift has a great deal to do with these three facets, so these three qualities are traits.

---

现在我只想指出三点，这三点就是最好的礼物所具备的特点，因此耶稣也具有这些特质。通过思考耶稣作为礼物的意义，我认为我们会更好地理解他是谁以及我们应该如何与他相处。首先，我不是说所有礼物都具备这三个特点，但最优秀的礼物确实具备这些特点。所以，构成礼物本质的三个方面正是这三点特征。

## 礼物是惊喜 / Gifts Are Surprises

Number one, gifts are surprises, a good gift, the best gifts are unexpected. They're a surprise. Now it doesn't mean that all gifts have to be a surprise, and some great gifts sometimes are not a surprise, but the power and the delight.

The giftness of the gift is greatly enhanced when it's not, when something that surprises you. And of course, a surprise by definition is something you don't expect. And so the quintessential language of a person who's just had a great gift, has just experienced a great gift.

The quintessential language is, I didn't expect it. I wasn't even looking for it, but it's exactly what I need. That's it.

I didn't expect it. I wasn't looking for it. It wasn't on my end of my list, but now that I see it, of course, why didn't I want it?

Why didn't I ask somebody for it? It's perfect. Thank you so much.

I mean, not only is it great to experience a gift like that, but it's great to give a gift and have that experience, have the person who you've given the gift to have that experience. I didn't want it. I didn't expect it.

I mean, I didn't look for it. I didn't write it down, but now that I see it, it's exactly what I need and exactly what I want. I submit to you that the way you can tell the difference between a Christian, a person who's had a true, transforming experience of Christ, how you can tell that kind of person from someone who's just a kind of, who just has formal religion, a person who's just characterized by moral niceness and not by a transforming experience of Christ, is this very thing.

Real Christians, people who've really experienced Christ in a vital way, always feel the same way. There's been a watershed in their life. There's been a place in their experience they can look back to, it could be last week, it could be last month, last year, last decade, but you know there was a time in which you thought you knew all about Jesus, you really thought, but when you met Him, there's a revolution in your understanding.

You might have been raised in church, you might have gone to sunny school all of your life and so on. You thought you knew all about it. A Christian is always somebody who's had his or her understanding of Jesus revolutionized because when Jesus actually shows up, when you actually meet Him, you say, this is not at all what I expected.

This is not at all what I wanted, and yet now that I have it, it's exactly what I needed. Yes, Jesus is a gift, so He always is a surprise. And the way you can tell you've met Him is you've been shocked, surprised.

You know, your expectations shattered by Him. Has that happened to you? If it has not happened to you, if it's never happened to you, you have not even met Him.

You haven't even rejected Him because you haven't rejected the real Jesus. Let me just show you why the Bible says, in fact, it was read today and one of the lessons at one of our services, He came to His own, but His own received Him not. Many people accepted Him, but not many.

When He was here on earth, remember not many. When He called all of His apostles and disciples and followers together to get together after He was gone, they all got together in the upper room, there was only 120 of them. So by and large He was rejected, only a few really received Him.

1. 礼物是惊喜，最好的礼物往往是意想不到的。它们是一种惊喜。当然，并不是所有的礼物都必须是惊喜，有时候一些很棒的礼物并不是意外得到的，但这种惊喜和喜悦感更加强烈。当礼物不期而至时，它的魔力和愉悦感会大大增强。

而惊喜这个词本身就意味着你没有预料到。所以，一个刚刚收到伟大礼物的人最典型的语言就是：“我没有想到。”“我甚至都没有期待过它，但它正是我所需要的。” 我没有想到，我没有寻找过，它也没有在我的清单上，但现在看到它，当然，为什么我没有想要它？

为什么不向别人要呢？它是完美的，非常感谢。不仅体验到这样的礼物很棒，而且能够给他人送这样一份惊喜的礼物也很棒。你没有想要它，也没有期待过它，但它正是你需要和想要的东西。

我向你们提出一个观点：你可以通过这一点来区分**真正的基督徒——那些真正经历了基督转化的人，与那些只是**有形式宗教、仅仅表现出道德善良而没有经历基督深刻转变的人。**真正的基督徒，那些以鲜活的方式体验过基督的人，总是**会有同样的感受。他们的生命中有一个转折点，他们可以在自己的经历中找到一个可以回顾的时刻，可能是上周、上个月、去年或者十年前，但你知道，在某个时间点你认为自己已经完全了解了耶稣，但实际上当你遇见祂时，你的理解发生了革命性的变化。你可能是在教会长大的，也可能一生都在阳光学校里度过。

你以为自己对这一切都了如指掌。一个基督徒总是那些对耶稣的理解被彻底改变的人，因为当你真正遇见祂的时候，你会说：“这完全不是我想象中的。”“这完全不是我想要的，但如今我有了，这才是我真正需要的。”是的，耶稣是一个礼物，所以祂总是一个惊喜。

你能够感受到你遇见了祂的方式就是——你被震惊、被惊异。你知道，你的期望被祂打破了。这样的事情发生在你身上了吗？如果没有发生过，如果从未发生过，那你甚至都没有遇见祂。

你没有拒绝祂，因为你还没有拒绝真正的耶稣。让我来告诉你为什么圣经这样说，在我们今天读到的一段经文中提到：“祂来到自己的地方，自己的人却不接受祂。”很多人接受了祂，但不多。当祂在地上时，记得当时并不多人接受祂。

当祂离开后召集所有的使徒、门徒和跟随者一起聚会时，他们聚集在上层房间里，只有120个人。所以总的来说，祂被拒绝了，真正接纳祂的人很少。

## 人们为何拒绝真正的弥赛亚 / Why They Refused the Real Messiah

Why? The answer is He did not meet the expectations of people who expected a Messiah, they expected a certain kind of person. He came and He said, I'm the Messiah.

Well, they had their expectations and He didn't meet those expectations. And the reason they missed Him was they refused to be surprised. They refused.

They refused to see Jesus as a gift. Messiah's a gift and the gift will always surprise you, will shatter your expectations. See, what did they expect?

They expected a Messiah, but the Messiah had to be a political leader. The Messiah had to be a person of power, a person with clout, a person who could really get things done. Because you see, the people, His own, those people said, we're under the thumb, we're under the boot of the Roman oppressor.

We need someone who can get something done, who can get the boot off of us. And so, along comes Jesus. They expect the Messiah to say, those people are the problem, those people are the problem.

We're going to do something about it. Instead, the Messiah comes along and says, repent. Jesus comes out and says, repent.

He refuses to become political. He refuses actually to, I mean, He's born as a helpless baby to a poor family in a backwater part of the country. He never gets any kind of the right connections.

He never becomes an influential person, he just wanders around. And what does he say? If you read the Gospel, you'll see the summarization of everything that he taught while he was on Earth was, repent.

And everybody said, this is the Messiah, forget it. This couldn't be the Messiah. This is supposed to be the one who's going to save us.

The one who's going to deal with our problems couldn't be. And so, the only people that received Him were the people, those few, who are willing to let their expectations be shattered. Who are willing to listen to Him and say, oh my, this isn't at all what I expected, but He's exactly what I need.

为什么呢？答案是因为人们期待的弥赛亚与耶稣不符。

他们期望的是一个特定类型的人物——弥赛亚必须是一个政治领袖，必须是有权势、有影响力的人，能够真正做成事情的人。因为你看，那些人说：“我们受制于罗马人的压迫之下。” 你知道吗？当耶稣来的时候，人们期待的是一位政治领袖，一位有权势的人，能真正解决问题的人。

但耶稣却没有满足他们的期望。他们之所以错过了祂，是因为他们拒绝被惊喜，拒绝把耶稣看作是一个礼物。弥赛亚是礼物，而礼物总是会打破你的预期。那么，他们到底期望的是什么呢？

他们期待的是一位弥赛亚，但这位弥赛亚必须是政治领袖，一位有影响力的人，能够真正解决问题的人。因为当时，祂自己的子民说：“我们受制于罗马人的压迫之下。” **我们需要一个能解决问题的人，能把压在我们身上的靴子踢开。**于是，耶稣出现了。

人们期待弥赛亚会说：“那些人是问题，我们要解决他们。” 相反，弥赛亚来了却说：“悔改。”耶稣出来就说：“悔改。” 他拒绝卷入政治。

事实上，他出生在一个贫穷家庭的偏远地区，只是一个无助的婴儿。他从未获得过任何重要的关系或影响力。他只是四处游荡。他都说了些什么？

如果你读福音书，你会发现他在世时教导的一切总结起来就是“悔改”。所有人都说：“这是弥赛亚，不行。”这不可能是弥赛亚。“我们要解决的问题的人”不可能是他。

因此，只有那些愿意打破自己的期望、愿意听他的话并说“哦，我的天，这不是我想象中的样子，但他正是我所需要的"人才会接受他。

## 问题在你自己，不在别人 / The Problem Is You, Not Them

Now, let me get real personal at this point. The average person, and plenty of you who are Christians know that you started out this way too. Why did you start coming back to church?

I mean, most people I meet in New York who are Christians or people who either never went to church or else spent a lot of time away from it. Why did you ever start coming? Why did you ever start seeking again?

Why did you ever start reading and thinking? Because you were looking for the other kind of Messiah. You know, you say, my career is stalled, and I need someone with power who can break up the log jam.

Or here I am kind of lonely and I need a relationship, or I've got problems and I need someone who will come in and do something for me. There's problems in my life. There's people who have abused me, people who have oppressed me, people who have kept me down.

I haven't gotten promoted. I've got needs. I've got some.

I need a God who will come into my life and deal with those things. You're just like the people in that day that rejected him. They were looking for Messiah with power with clout.

But here's what's so unexpected about the Messiah. Here's what's so unexpected about him. Here's what shatters us.

We all think our problems are due to the people out there. They're the ones. The have say, the have nots are the problem.

They're unproductive and they're lawless and they're dragging us down. And the have nots say the problem are the haves. They open doors for each other and get each other into the right clubs and the right boardrooms and they won't share the power.

They won't share the wealth. We're going to get it from them anyway. So everybody thinks there's somebody else.

Our problems is someone would deal with that group or those outside forces. Then things would be okay. But the Marilla Messiah always comes and says, repent.

Which means the problems are not out there, they're in here. Your primary problem says the real Messiah is you, not them, you. That the reason they rejected him the first time was they expected the Messiah, they expected the Messiah to say, they're the problem.

But the real Messiah came along and said, repent, you're the problem. Some years ago G. K.

Chesterton, the great man of letters couldn't resist writing into a particular prominent newspaper in Britain, the early part of the century that was actually running a kind of series of essays and editorials asking various prominent people to answer the question, what's wrong with the world today? The problem with the world is, and then they would write an essay, and each week some prominent person would say, the problem of the world is this, the problem with the world is this, the problem with the world is this. It's a great idea for a series by the way.

Bill Mewers will come up with it eventually, I think. You get a bunch of very, very important people and say the problem with the world is this. G.

K. Chesterton couldn't resist, he wrote in, he was a Christian, he wrote in, a very short letter, and he says, dear, you know, times. The problem with the world is me, science and serily, G.

K. Chesterton. And anyone who's met the real Messiah feels the same way.

Anyone who's met the real Messiah knows that's the case. The real problem with your life and the real problem with the world is the selfishness in your own heart. It's the self-centeredness of your own heart, it's the flaws of your own heart.

It's the self-deception of your own heart. It's your sin. Now, if there's anybody here who says, I want anything to do with that kind of talk that's primitive and obscene, you know, that's old-fashioned, fine.

You haven't met Jesus, that's all. This is not my, what I'm saying. The real Messiah always comes through and shocks you and the difference between moral nice people and real Christians.

Christians are people who have met the real Jesus and he has revolutionized their understanding. He is not what they expected. If you today don't think that repentance is the thing you most need in your life, repentance.

If you don't know that, you haven't received the gift because a Christian is someone who says, repent. Now years later, we say, I never thought of it, I never asked for it. It wasn't the gift I wanted, but now I see it's exactly what I need.

Is that ever happened to you? Has there ever been this kind of change in your consciousness about the Messiah? Have you seen that?

See, if not, you haven't met him. That's all I'm trying to say. And by the way, it may mean that you haven't even reject the real one.

Because the real Jesus Christ, no one is, if you have a kind of casual ho-hum relationship to Jesus, if you say, well, I like a lot of the things he says, but it's hard to know all about what he said. If you have a casual relationship to him, if you read the Bible, you'll see that no one ever did. And no one who ever met the real Jesus had a casual reaction.

They either loved him and threw down their lives and did anything for him and followed him or else they hated him and tried to kill him or they were scared of death and they wanted to run away from him. And if you are not afraid of him or hate him or love him from your heart, you have never met the real one anyway. You've never really seen what he claims.

You've never really seen what he does. He's a surprise because he's a gift. He's the inexpressible gift because he's surprised you.

现在让我变得非常个人化一点。普通人，包括你们中许多基督徒都知道，你们当初也是这样开始的。为什么你会重新回到教堂？

我遇到很多在纽约的基督徒或曾经离开教会很久的人，他们为什么会重新回来？为什么会再次寻求？为什么会开始阅读和思考？因为他们都在寻找另一种弥赛亚。

你说：“我的事业停滞了，我需要一个有权力的人来打破僵局。”或者“我有点孤单，需要一段关系”，或者“我有问题，需要有人为我解决。”生活中有困难，有人曾虐待你、压迫你或让你处于不利地位。我没有晋升，我有需求，我有希望。

我需要一个能够进入我的生活、处理那些事情的神。你们就像那个时代拒绝他的人一样。他们寻找的是有势力的弥赛亚。但关于弥赛亚，这里有一个出乎意料的地方。

关于他的地方，这里有一个颠覆我们认知的东西。我们都认为自己的问题都是因为外面的人。是他们的错。拥有权势的人是问题所在，而没有权势的人则是受害者。

那些人不积极也不守法，他们拖累了我们。而那些没有的人则说问题在于有的人。他们互相帮助进入正确的俱乐部和董事会，并不愿意分享权力和财富。我们会从他们那里得到这一切的。

所以大家都认为有人可以解决那个群体或外部力量的问题，世界就会变得好起来。但马利亚里的弥赛亚总是来告诉我们：悔改。**这意味着你的问题不在外面，而在里面。****真正的弥赛亚告诉你：真正的问题是**你自己，而不是别人。

这就是为什么第一次他们拒绝他的原因——他们以为弥赛亚会说：“是他们的错。” 而**真正的弥赛亚来了，却说：“悔改，你们才是**问题。” 几年前，G.K. 背斯廉，这位伟大的文学家无法抗拒，在英国一家当时正在连载一系列关于“当今世界的问题”的文章和评论的报纸上写了一封短信。他写道： 亲爱的，你知道，时代的问题就是我。

世界的问题是科学和严肃地，G. K. 背斯廉没有错，他确实说出了真相：问题在于我们自己。K. 背斯朋。而任何真正见过基督的人都是这样认为的。任何人如果真的见过基督，就知道这一点。

你生命中最大的问题，世界最大的问题，就是你内心中的自私。是你内心的自我中心，是你内心的缺陷和自欺。是你的罪。如果你中有谁说，我根本不想听这种原始且下流的言论，那很好，因为你还没有见过耶稣。

这不是我要表达的意思。**真正的基督总是**会给你带来震撼，并且真正基督徒与道德上体面的人之间的区别就在于此。基督徒是那些真正遇见了耶稣并且他的理解被彻底改变的人。他不是他们所期望的样子。

如果你今天认为悔改是你生命中最需要的，那就去悔改吧。如果你不知道这一点，那你就还没有接受这份礼物，因为一个基督徒就是会说“悔改”的人。多年后，我们可能会说，“我从未想过这个问题，也从没要求过它。”这不是我想要的礼物，但现在我发现这才是我真正需要的。

这在你身上发生过吗？你是否曾经对基督有这种意识上的转变？你见过这样的改变吗？要知道，如果没有经历过这些，你就还没有遇见他。

这就是我要表达的意思。顺便说一句，这也可能意味着你甚至没有拒绝真正的耶稣。因为真正的耶稣基督，没有人会以一种随意的态度对待他。如果你说，“我喜欢他说的很多东西，但很难知道他所说的全部。

”如果你对他有一种随意的态度，那么当你读圣经时，你会发现没有人是这样的。真正见过耶稣的人没有任何人是以一种随意的态度去面对他的。要么他们爱他，为他献出一切，并跟随他；要么他们恨他，试图杀死他；要么他们害怕死亡，想要远离他。如果你既不害怕他也不恨他，也没有真心地爱他，那么你从未遇见真正的耶稣，也从未真正看到过他所宣称的一切。

你从没真正见过他所做的一切。他是个惊喜，因为他是礼物。他是难以言表的礼物，因为他让你感到意外。其次，我将简要说明这一点，但我觉得有必要提及。

## 礼物可能令人不悦 / Gifts Can Be Insulting

Secondly, and I'll be a little more brief on this, but I think it's fair to say, not all gifts are like this, but I think we need at least touch on it. Secondly, in certain contexts, gifts can be insulting. We said gifts are always surprising.

Sometimes gifts are insulting. Well, it depends on the gift, you know. I'll tell you, let me give you a great example of where it might happen.

You're going to get your paycheck and your employer has your paycheck, let's say. He says, yes, here it is. Here's what we usually, you know, we always pay you every month or every two weeks.

But I want you to know that this particular pay period, this is a gift. Here, Merry Christmas. And you know, that would be an insult.

Be an absolute insult because here you thought you were working. And if your employer says, Merry Christmas, this is a gift. What is she saying?

What is he saying? I'll tell you what they're saying. Your employer is trying to say, you didn't deserve this.

Therefore, it's a gift. Now gifts can be insulting. Let me say, and let me suggest to you, that the gift of Jesus Christ is not only a surprise, but it's always an insult, always.

Because you see most people feel like they're trying their very best. If you're a religious type, there's plenty of different folks that say, you know, if I ask them, do you believe in heaven, yes, they say, well, why do you think you're going to get there? You say, well, I'm trying.

Well, how are you trying? I'm trying to be good. I'm trying to live a good life.

I'm trying to get there. I think I'm doing as well as many, many people. In fact, maybe doing better than most.

Even if you're not religious, you have the same basic attitude. You say, I know that there's some kind of spiritual reality and I'm doing my best to honor it. I'm doing my best to reach it.

I'm trying to be a loving person. I'm trying to be a good and kind and decent person. I'm trying my very best.

The heart of the gospel is that you are mistaken, that you are self deceived, that the only way anyone can reach God, the only way anyone can ever reach eternal life, the only way anyone can ever connect with God is if it's a complete and sheer and utter gift. You may know the story of the prodigal son, but it's not just about a wayward younger brother. In fact, Jesus tells this story to speak both to those who run from God and to those who try to earn his love by being good.

In his book, The prodigal God, Tim Keller shows how this well-known story reveals the heart of the gospel, a message of hope for both the rebellious younger brother and the judgmental older brother, and an invitation for all to experience God's prodigal, extravagant grace. Whether you're a Christian or you're still exploring faith, The prodigal God will help you see a relationship with Christ in a whole new way. The prodigal God is our thank you for your gift this month to help gospel and life share the hope and joy of Christ's gracious and relentless love with people all over the world.

不是所有的礼物都是这样的，但我认为我们至少需要提到这一点。其次，在某些情况下，礼物可能会令人不悦。我们说过，礼物总是令人惊讶的。有时候礼物会让人不悦。

这要看是什么样的礼物了。让我给你举一个很好的例子来说明这种情况。你即将拿到工资，而你的雇主拿着你的工资说：“是的，这是你的。” 通常来说，我们会每个月或每两周收到一次工资。

但我要告诉你，在这个特定的薪资周期里，这是我送给你的礼物。圣诞快乐。你知道，这会是一个侮辱。绝对是一个侮辱，因为你认为自己在工作。

如果雇主说“圣诞快乐，这是礼物”，他在说什么？他在说什么？告诉你吧，雇主的意思是，你并不配得到这笔钱。因此，这就是一个礼物。

现在，礼物可能会令人不悦。让我再说一遍，并且建议你们，耶稣基督的礼物不仅是惊喜，而且总是侮辱，永远都是。因为你看，大多数人都觉得自己已经尽力了。如果你是一个宗教人士，有很多人会告诉你，如果问他们是否相信天堂，他们会说：“是的。

” 你再问他们为什么认为自己能去那里，他们会说：“我在努力。” 你是怎么努力的？我尽力做好事。我尽力过好生活。

我尽力达到那个目标。我认为我的表现至少和很多人一样好，甚至可能比大多数人更好。即使你不信仰宗教，你的态度也是一样的。你会说：“我知道有一种精神现实存在，并且尽我所能去尊重它。

” 我在努力接近它。我在尽力成为一个善良、仁慈、正直的人。我尽力做到最好。福音的核心在于，你们错了，你们自我欺骗了。

唯一通往上帝的道路，唯一的永生之路，唯一能够与上帝连接的方式，都是完全的恩赐。你可能知道浪子回头的故事，但这不仅仅是关于一个离家出走的小儿子。事实上，耶稣讲这个故事是为了向那些远离上帝的人和那些试图通过做好事来赢得祂爱的人传达信息。在《浪子的神》这本书中，蒂姆·凯勒展示了这个广为人知的故事揭示了福音的核心——对叛逆小儿子和苛责大儿子的信息都是希望的宣告，并且邀请所有人体验上帝慷慨、无尽的恩典。

无论你是基督徒还是还在探索信仰，读《浪子的神》都能帮助你以全新的方式看待与基督的关系。《浪子的神》是我们感谢您本月对福音和生命分享基督仁慈不懈之爱所带来的希望和喜乐的支持。今天就访问 gospelandlife.com/give 获取您的副本吧。现在，请听蒂姆·凯勒博士继续今天的教导。

## 无人能赚取，无人配得上 / No One Earns It, No One Deserves It

No one earns it, no one deserves it. I tell you, I don't know why because I'm not much of a confrontor, really, but I used to spend a lot of time in my first church back in Virginia. We had a lot of elderly people in the town, like a lot of small towns, a lot of elderly people in our church, and I went to see a lot of people in their deathbeds, and what amazed me, how often they would say they would be willing to say they were scared, and I would say, what are you anxious about, and so often, so often, those folks would say, I don't know, I don't know, I've tried my best, I've tried my best to be a good mother, I've tried my best to be a good father, I've tried my best, you know, what they're saying is, I don't know if I'm ready to die, I'm anxious about it, I think I've tried my best, I think I've tried my best to be good, and I don't like to confront people, but I used to say back then, I said, well, no one do your anxious, no one's ever done their best in neither of you.

And that usually opened up into this whole theme, the Christian message, the heart of the Christian message is salvation, whatever you want to call it, eternal life, whatever you want to call it, spiritual reality, connection with God, connection with the divine, must be a gift from God to you, it cannot be an attainment from you toward him, impossible. That's the essence, and that is where Christianity diverges from every other religion, every other religion. It says, you've never done your best, no wonder you're anxious, and you'll always be anxious until you see the giftness of Jesus Christ, He's a gift.

没有人能赚到它，也没有人配得上它。我告诉你们，我不知道为什么，因为我并不是一个喜欢冲突的人，但我在弗吉尼亚的第一家教会度过了很多时间。那个小镇有很多老年人，我们教会也有很多老人，所以我经常去看望那些病床上的人。让我惊讶的是，他们中很多人会说他们害怕死亡，我会问他们害怕什么，而他们常常回答：我不知道，我尽力了，我尽力做一个好母亲/父亲，我尽力了……他们在说，我不确定自己是否准备好面对死亡，我很焦虑，我认为我已经尽力做好人了，但我不喜欢和人冲突，但我那时常说：你们不用焦虑，没有人能真正尽到自己的责任。

这通常会引出一个主题——基督教的信息。基督教的核心信息就是救赎，无论你叫它什么，永恒的生命，灵性的真实，与神的联系或与神圣的连接，这一切都必须是来自上帝的恩赐，而不是你自己向他追求的结果，这是不可能的。这就是基督教与其他所有宗教的区别所在。其他宗教都说：你们从未尽到自己的责任，难怪你们会焦虑，直到你看到耶稣基督的恩赐，祂就是恩赐。

## 恩典比道德主义更包容 / Grace: More Inclusive Than Moralism

We talked about it this morning, you know, under a different heading, but it's good to mention it again. People, so many people, are irritated with the only wayness of Christianity, irritated by the fact that Jesus says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the father but by me. And so people feel like, oh, that sounds too exclusive, and so people usually respond by saying something like this, well, they said, yeah, that's how you Christians believe I know, but I believe that anyone who is good, and anyone who is moral, and anyone who is diligent, and anyone who is loving can reach God.

That sounds very open-minded, but not at all, it's very exclusive anyway. It's tremendously exclusive. What about those of us who are not good?

What about those of us who are not able? What about those of us who are not disciplined? What about those of us who are not wonderful in loving?

And that's an awful lot of us. What about those of us who are a mess? You know, it sounds so wonderful to say, yes, you Christians say all you have to do is you have to receive Christ, and then you connect with God.

I believe that all good people can connect with God, fine. What about those of us who are not? Look on it, that's exclusive to say that.

What about us failures? You successes, you know? You people who know how to pull yourselves together emotionally.

You people who have got wonderful records of being kind and good fathers and good mothers and good citizens, fine. What about the rest of us? You've cut us off because you don't believe that God and eternal life is a gift.

Every religion and every philosophy says, here's how to reach God go do it. And Christianity stands completely apart and says no, it must be a gift. So you have these verses like this, just to give you some examples.

You have first Corinthians 1.30, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Boy, all those big words, you know what he's saying? That's Paul talking.

It says, but of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made of God unto us to be wisdom and righteousness. Are you wise? See, what it means to be a Christian?

Are you redeemed? Are you righteous? What does it mean to be a Christian?

It means when you unite to Christ, you're righteous in him. He is your righteousness. He is your performance.

He is your record. Thank God we've finally got a religion that's not so exclusive that it's only for the good people. Thank God we've got a religion that's based on gift.

And because it's based on gift, it's for anybody and anyone. Do you see? Jesus is a gift, but don't you understand?

You've got to let yourself be insulted properly or you can't receive the gift. What if your employer was standing there and saying, yes, here's your money, but let me just tell you, considering the way you've been working the last month, this is nothing but a gift. Mary Christmas, what could you do?

I know what a lot of you would do. You would say, if that's how you feel about it, I don't want your bleeding charity. And that is how people walk away from Christianity all the time.

That's how people walk away from Christ all the time. You can't receive Jesus Christ unless you're willing to admit that you need Him. You can't receive unless you're willing to admit that you're not going to be able to reach it, that you're not going to be able to be loving enough, that morality and goodness is not enough that you're never going to be able to find God on your own.

Don't you see? You've got to let yourself be insulted before you can receive it. Has to be done.

It's got to be done. You know, if you say, that's too easy, that's just too easy. You're telling me, years ago, years ago again, I remember in virtually a shack, a very, very poor, small rundown shack and one of the worst parts of the little town where I was a pastor and I sat down with a woman and tried to, I was a brand new minister too and I tried to explain to her the giftedness of the gospel and she listened to me and she said, let me get this straight.

She says, if I lead a very good life, try my best, all my life to be good and to be nice and to do my best, and I tried to explain to her, I said, give me a break. Nobody does it. Well, she said, let me give you, if I do my best and I never feel that I really need Jesus Christ as my Savior, I'll be cut off, but you're trying to tell me that some serial killer.

You know, before he goes into the gas chamber, if from his heart, really from his heart, he admits that there's no way he can reach God and he reaches out and takes hold by faith of Jesus Christ, he will receive, you know, he will be ushered in. He will come into the family, he'll connect with God. I said, that's right.

She says, that's the most ridiculous religion I've ever heard. Jesus, what do you think I am? Uh-huh.

See? Walking away from you. God is there saying, you see your salary, this is a gift.

The Bible says, the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. If you refuse to take the check because your employer, in this case, God says, this is a gift. If you say, keep your bleeding charity, you'll be cut off forever.

Yeah, why? Because you see, what if your employer's right? What makes you think that in your pride, she's wrong.

In fact, what if you find that that's just the way you are and that every employer is going to feel the same way about you? Eventually, don't you see? What if she's right?

What if God is right? What if even the best of us are not trying our best? What if the best of us are selfish?

What if the best of us even when we do good deeds are doing them for ourselves? What if all of us really are trying to live our own lives, trying to be our own bosses, trying to be masters of our own fates and captains of our own soul, and therefore all deserve to be cut off unless we receive the free gift? Jesus Christ died on the cross.

Jesus Christ lived a perfect life in our place so that the just requirements of God, the righteousness is fulfilled. And therefore, we can receive it as a gift. If somebody says, you know, this is all very, very, very doctrinal, I don't believe any of this stuff.

I don't need it. But you do. You do.

You yourself are trying to earn your way into something. You've all got your own righteousness, everyone in this room. Some of us get our righteousness, we get our sense of self-worth, our self-image out of our accomplishments, our career, some out of relationships, some out of our control over our bodies, some over how we look, there's all kinds of ways, but nobody can live without finding something that is your righteousness.

And yet Paul says, before God, your righteousness is a filthy rag, only in Christ are you made unto God, righteousness and wisdom and sanctification and redemption? Do you understand that Jesus is a gift? He's an insulting gift.

我们昨天早上也提过，虽然用的是不同的标题，但再次提到它还是很有意义的。很多人对基督教唯一的道路感到不满，他们觉得耶稣说我是唯一的道路、真理和生命，除了我没有人能到父那里去，这话听起来太排他了。因此人们通常会这样回应：“你们基督徒就是这样相信的吧？但我认为只要是一个好人，一个有道德的人，一个勤奋的人，一个爱人的人，都可以达到上帝。

” 这听上去很开明，但实际上却非常排他。它是非常排他的。那那些不好的人怎么办？那些做不到的人怎么办？

那些没有自律的人怎么办？那些不爱别人的人又该怎么办呢？我们当中有很多这样的情况。那那些一塌糊涂的人怎么办？

你说，是的，你们基督徒说只要接受基督就能与上帝相连。我同意所有好人可以与上帝相连，很好。但那些不是这样的人呢？你这样说也是排他的。

那些失败者怎么办？你们成功人士知道怎么控制自己的情绪，有很好的记录成为好父亲、好母亲和好公民，很好。那我们其他人怎么办呢？你们已经把我们排除在外了，因为你认为上帝与永恒的生命是礼物。

每一种宗教和哲学都说，这是达到上帝的方法，你去做吧。但基督教却完全与众不同地说，这必须是礼物。所以你看这些经文，比如哥林多前书1章30节：“我们在基督耶稣里也是被神称为义的，因为他使主耶稣成为我们的智慧、公义、圣洁和救赎。”那些大词，你知道他在说什么吗？

这是保罗在说话。他说，在基督耶稣里我们是被神称为义的，他是我们的智慧。你有智慧吗？看看做一个基督徒意味着什么。

你是得救的吗？你是义人吗？什么是基督徒？**这意味着当你与基督联合时，你在祂里面是义人。**

祂就是你的义，祂就是你的行为。祂就是你的记录。感谢上帝，我们终于有了一个不那么排他的宗教，它不只是为好人准备的。感谢上帝，我们有了一个基于恩赐的宗教。

因为它是基于恩赐的，所以它是任何人的、每个人的。你明白吗？耶稣是恩赐，但你不明白吗？你必须让自己被侮辱得恰到好处，否则你就不能接受这个礼物。

假如你的雇主站在那里说：“是的，这是你的钱，但是让我告诉你，在过去的这个月里，考虑到你工作的情况，这纯粹是一个礼物。”玛丽圣诞节，你会怎么办？我知道你们很多人会怎么做。你会说：“如果你这样想，我不要你流血的慈善。

”而人们就是这样离开基督教的。人们就是这样离开基督的。除非你愿意承认你需要祂，否则你不能接受耶稣基督。除非你承认自己无法达到这个标准，无法做到爱，道德和善良不足以让你找到上帝，否则你就不能接受。

你不明白吗？你必须让自己被侮辱得恰到好处才能接受它。这是必须做的。这必须做。

你知道，如果你说：“这太容易了，这实在是太容易了。”你告诉我，几年前，甚至更早的时候，我记得在一个几乎像棚屋的小屋里，一个非常贫穷、破旧的小棚屋，我在一个小城镇担任牧师时，我和一位女士坐下来交谈，我是一个新任的牧师，我试图向她解释福音的恩赐性。她听了我说的话后说：“让我搞清楚。” 她说道：“如果我过得很正直，尽我最大的努力，一生都做好人、做善事，尽力而为。

我试着向她解释说：‘给我点时间吧。没有人能做到这一点。’她说，‘那好，如果我尽了最大努力，却从不觉得自己真正需要耶稣基督作为我的救主，我就被切断联系。但你却告诉我，一个连环杀手也需要耶稣。

’ 你知道，在他走向毒气室之前，如果他的内心深处真的意识到自己无法达到上帝，并且通过信心抓住耶稣基督，他会得到拯救，他会进入家庭，与上帝相连。我说，没错。她说：“这是我听过的最荒谬的宗教。”耶稣，你觉得我是谁？

嗯？你看？她正要离开你。上帝在那里说：‘看看你的薪水，这是一份礼物。

’ 圣经上说：“罪的工价乃是死”，但“神的恩赐是永远的生命”。如果你拒绝接受这份支票，因为你雇主——在这种情况下是上帝——说这是礼物，你会被永远切断联系。是啊，为什么？因为，如果你的雇主是对的，你凭什么认为在骄傲中你是对的？

事实上，如果你发现那就是你的真实情况，并且每个雇主都会对你有同样的看法，最终你不就会明白吗？如果她是对的呢？如果上帝是对的呢？如果连我们最好的人也没有尽全力呢？

如果连我们最好的人都自私呢？如果连我们最好的人在做好事时也是为了自己呢？如果我们所有人真的都在试图过自己的生活，想做自己的老板，主宰自己的命运和灵魂，那么除非我们接受这份免费礼物——耶稣基督——否则我们都应该被切断联系。耶稣基督在十字架上为我们受死。

耶稣基督为我们的罪过活出完美的一生，使神的公义得以满足。因此，我们可以将它作为礼物接受。如果有人说：“这都是很理论的东西，我不相信这些。我根本不需要这些东西。

”但你确实需要。你需要。你自己正试图靠自己的努力去获得什么。你们每个人都有自己的义，这房间里每个人都有一份自认为值得的尊严和形象。

有人通过成就、事业来获取义，有人通过人际关系，有人通过控制身体或外貌，形式多种多样，但没有人能不找到某种自我价值感而生活。然而保罗说，在神面前，你的义不过是污秽的衣服；只有在基督里你才能被神算为义，并且得着智慧和圣洁与救赎？你们明白吗？耶稣是一个礼物，甚至是一个令人惊讶的、甚至是侮辱性的礼物。

## 以马内利的无价之宝 / The Immeasurable Value of Emmanuel

Now, lastly, we said, Jesus is a gift, that means he's a surprise, as he surprised you. Jesus is a gift, and that means actually he's insulting, because you've got to see that what he offers is a gift, it's not something you can earn. But thirdly, lastly, Jesus Christ is immensely valuable, all gifts, really great gifts.

You look at them, you know, the best gifts are the gifts that you look at and you say, I never, ever would have bought this for myself. In fact, the best gifts are the ones in which you realize I never, ever could have bought this for myself. I couldn't have afforded this.

This is wonderful, you say. Those are the best gifts. They're surprising, but they're also tremendously valuable and you look at them and the joy just wells up the more you're able to appreciate, the more you're able to see the value of it.

What have you got in Jesus? You've got God with us. You have Emmanuel as you were singing.

You know, I wonder, think of it this way, the first person to ever ask for God to be with him, to really be with him, was Moses. The first person to ask for Emmanuel, which is the Hebrew word that means God with us. Jesus Christ is God come to be with us, come near.

Now the first person to ever ask for that was Moses, Moses. And he said, I don't want to lead the people into the promised land unless you come with us, unless you be with us. Now what did God do?

I want your presence, said Moses. Now you know, modern people have no idea how valuable the presence of God is because we've trivialized it. So you can't understand this, what a valuable gift it is because Moses said, I want your presence.

I want your face. I want to be with you. Now what did God say to Moses?

He said, of course, sure. Why? I'm always close to anyone.

You know, was God a sort of warm fuzzy? Did God like ET? Did he come around Moses and hug him and then say, put his finger on his forehead and say, I'll be right here, I'll always be with you.

You know, no. What did God say to Moses? He says, I can't come with you, it'll kill you.

I can't be with you, it will kill you. See, Moses understood the value of what we got at Christmas. Moses asked for the presence of God.

Now modern people can't understand why God would say such a thing, they can't understand it because they have no concept of the majesty of God, no concept of all. People who have really gotten close to God have begun to move in, they begin to realize how traumatic the presence of God is. His hugeness makes us feel little.

His purity makes us feel dirty, his permanence makes us feel temporary, his depth makes us feel shallow, and the closer we get to him, the more we see what a towering tower of purity and power he is, the more traumatized we are. You know, some weeks ago, we talked about this, when human beings even get near moral human moral excellence, relative, imperfect human moral excellence, we're threatened. I told you about a couple of weeks ago, a Christian cop who stopped taking bribes, but a Christian businessman had started to actually report his income on his taxes.

About a Christian woman who was in a government agency and she started to really work very, very hard in her department and around her and around the businessman and around the cop, people got unbelievably threatened. Do you know how bad you're going to make us look? When we even get close to human moral excellence, imperfect human moral excellence, we're traumatized.

What do you think it's like to actually dwell in the presence of the perfectly thrice holy God, holy, holy, holy. See, Moses understood what he was asking for and Moses understood why God says, it would kill you. You can't.

Do you understand this? And now let's shift forward to Christmas and suddenly you know what's given to us at Christmas? A baby.

You know up until, if you go through the Bible, up until Christmas, the first Christmas, what you have, whenever God appears visibly, they're called theophonies, whenever God appears visibly, it's an incredibly intimidating form. You have, he appears as a smoking furnace to Abraham. He appears as a burning tree, you know, blazing tree to Moses.

He appears as a tornado to Job. He appears as a pillar of fire to the children of Israel. He appears as chicana brightness, glory coming down to the temple so nobody could even stand up, intimidating, you see.

最后，我们说过，耶稣是一个礼物，**这意味着他是个惊喜，因为他让你感到意外。**耶稣是一个礼物，意味着实际上他是侮辱性的，因为你要看到他所给你的不是你能赚得来的。但最重要的是，耶稣基督是极其宝贵的，所有的伟大礼物都是如此。你看那些礼物，最好的礼物是你拿到后会说：“我从未想过自己能买得起这个。

”事实上，最好的礼物往往是那些你意识到自己根本买不起的。你无法负担得起这些。这真是太棒了，你说。这些是最棒的礼物。

它们令人惊讶，但也很有价值，你越能欣赏它，就越能感受到它的价值。耶稣给你带来了什么？神与我们同在。正如你们所唱的，有 Emmanuel（神与我们同在）。

我想起一件事，第一个请求神与他同在的人是摩西。第一个请求 Emmanuel 的人也是摩西。他说：“我不愿意带领百姓进入应许之地，除非你和我们一起。”那么神做了什么呢？

摩西说：“我要你们的同在。”现在你们明白了吧，现代人根本不知道神的同在有多么宝贵，因为我们已经把它轻视了。所以你们无法理解这是一份多么宝贵的礼物，因为摩西说：“我要你们的同在。” 摩西说：“我想要你的脸。

我想与你在一起。”那么神对摩西说了什么？祂说：“当然可以，为什么不行？因为我总是亲近每一个人。

” 你知道吗，神是不是那种温暖舒适的家伙？神是不是像ET一样围着摩西转，然后拥抱他，并且用手指按在他的额头上说：“我会一直在这里，我永远都会与你同在。” 不，神对摩西说了什么？祂说：“我不能和你在一起，那会让你丧命。

” 我不能和你在一起，因为那会让你丧命。你看，摩西理解了我们在圣诞节得到的那份宝贵礼物的价值。摩西请求的是神的同在。现在现代人不明白为什么神会这么说，因为他们没有概念去理解神的伟大与威严。

真正亲近过神的人开始意识到，神的同在是多么令人震撼。祂的巨大让我们感觉自己渺小，祂的纯净让我们觉得自己肮脏，祂的永恒让我们感觉自己短暂，祂的深度让我们觉得自己浅薄。我们离祂越近，就越能感受到祂那无尽的纯洁与力量，也就越是被震撼。你知道吗，几周前我们就讨论过这个问题：当人类甚至接近道德上的优秀时——即使是不完美的人类道德上的优秀——我们也感到威胁。

我告诉你们，两周前有一个基督徒警察开始拒绝收受贿赂，而一个基督徒商人也开始如实申报他的收入。还有一个在政府部门工作的基督徒女性，她开始在她的部门以及周围工作得非常努力。当这些人接近了这种道德上的优秀时，人们变得异常不安：“你会让我们看起来有多糟糕？” 当我们甚至接近人类的道德优秀——不完美的道德优秀——我们也会感到震惊。

什么是真正地在全然圣洁的神面前安息，圣哉、圣哉、圣哉。你看，摩西明白他在求什么，也明白为什么神说你会被杀死——你不能。你能理解这一点吗？现在让我们转向圣诞节，你知道在圣诞节里我们得到了什么？

一个婴儿。直到圣诞节之前，在整本圣经中，每当神以可见的形式显现时，这些都被称为神显。每次神显现都是极其令人畏惧的形态。他向亚伯拉罕显现为焚烧的炉子；向摩西显现为燃烧的荆棘树；向约伯显现为旋风；向以色列人显现为火柱；向圣殿显现为荣光，以至于没有人能站立——那是非常令人敬畏的。

## 神以婴孩的形式显现 / God Appears as an Infant

But suddenly he appears as an infant. An infant, you know, there is nothing more accessible than an infant. One of the great things about having an infant of your own is they're totally open to you.

Absolutely open, you can always hug, you can always kiss. As soon as they get to be two, three, four, barriers start to go up. They become their own persons, you know, and that's all very right.

But for the purposes of the illustration, an infant is absolutely the most accessible thing possible. So accessible, so intimate, so completely open to you. God, this is what Christmas is about, the gift, God, this God, the holy God, this God, with all of his boundless glory, beauty beyond bearing, with unassailable majesty, this God has become an infant.

How is that possible? He became vulnerable so he could die on the cross, so the barriers between us could come down so that we could actually have access to God, we could have him come into our life, we could come into his presence, we could have God with us. You sang Emmanuel tonight.

You talk about God with us, you sing about it, you know, in the Christmas carols. Do you know the value of this gift? If Moses was here, and he heard us singing about Emmanuel, and then if he heard, or if he read in 2 Corinthians 3 where Paul says, we are not like Moses, we are not like Moses.

Before Moses had to put a veil over his face, but in Christ the veil was taken away. For God made his light to shine into our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And Moses would be jumping up and saying, do you people understand the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, God with us, the presence of God?

Do you understand the value of the gift? Are you filling your mind with the value of the gift? If you're bored tonight and you're a Christian, if you're having trouble with self-control tonight and you're a Christian, if you're discouraged tonight and you're a Christian, you have lost the sense of the value of the glorious thing that lives inside of you.

Because Jesus Christ broke the barrier, when you receive Christ, you receive Christ, He comes in, His nature, His power, His life comes in, His very presence comes in, and slurs to slowly transform you. Have you lost sight of that? Jesus Christ is the most valuable gift of all, something you never could have afforded yourself.

Do you know Jesus as the gift? Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift. Let's pray.

Thank you, Father, that you are a God who enables us and allows us to come into your presence as a gift. We pray that you would help us see that we can trust you. For if you did not spare your own son, how should we fail to trust you for everything else?

You're going to give us anything we need. So we pray, Lord, that you will help us to see that in Jesus Christ we have all the gifts we need. And I pray that the words that we looked at tonight and the teaching and the truths that we looked at tonight would be applied by your spirit to every person here individually, that no one would leave without having a deeper understanding and a desire to drink deep, to look even more deeply into the wonders of this inexpressible gift Jesus Christ and whose name we pray.

Amen. Again, it's all at gospelandlife.com. You can also stay connected with us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X.

但突然间，神以一个婴儿的形式出现。一个婴儿，你知道，没有什么比婴儿更易于接近的了。有自己亲生婴儿的人知道，婴儿是完全对你开放的。他们总是敞开心扉，你可以随时拥抱、亲吻。

一旦他们到了两岁、三岁、四岁，障碍就开始出现了，他们会变得有自己的个性——这是非常正确的。但为了这个比喻的目的，一个婴儿是最容易接近的东西。如此地易于接近，如此亲密，如此完全对你开放。神啊，这就是圣诞节的意义所在，礼物就是神，这圣洁的神，拥有无尽的荣耀和无法承载的美丽，不可动摇的威严，竟然成了一个婴儿。

这是怎么做到的？他变得脆弱，好能在十字架上受死，好打破我们之间的障碍，使我们可以接近神，让神进入我们的生活，让我们来到他的面前，让他与我们同在。你们今晚唱了“伊曼纽尔”。你跟我们谈论神，你们在圣诞颂歌中歌唱它。

你知道这份礼物的价值吗？如果摩西在这里，听到我们在唱“神与我们同在”，然后他又读到哥林多后书3章里保罗所说的话：我们不像摩西。在摩西蒙蔽脸庞之前，他必须带上遮盖物，但在基督里，遮盖物已经被除去了。因为神的光已经照进我们的心中，使我们明白神荣耀的知识，在耶稣基督的面上发光。

摩西会跳起来说：“你们这些人懂不懂神荣耀的知识，神与我们同在，神的临在？” 你知道这份礼物的价值吗？你是否让自己的思想充满了这份礼物的价值？如果你今晚感到无聊并且是基督徒，如果你今晚难以控制自己并且是基督徒，如果你今晚感到沮丧并且是基督徒，你就失去了那份珍贵礼物的意义。

因为耶稣基督打破了障碍。当你接受基督时，你接受了基督，祂的本性、力量和生命进入你的心中，祂的存在也进入你心中，并慢慢改变你。你是否已经忽略了这一点？耶稣基督是最宝贵的礼物，是你自己永远无法负担得起的。

你知道耶稣是这份礼物吗？感谢神赐给我们无法言喻的礼物。让我们祷告。天父啊，感谢祢使我们能够成为祢恩典中的礼物来到祢面前。

求祢帮助我们看到我们可以信任祢。因为祢连自己的儿子都不惜舍去，我们怎能不信任祢呢？祢会赐给我们所需要的一切。所以求祢帮助我们明白，在耶稣基督里我们拥有所有需要的礼物。

愿今晚我们所查考的话语、教导和真理，都能在圣灵中应用到每一个人身上，使没有人离开这里时没有更深刻的理解和渴慕去探索这无法言喻的礼物——耶稣基督。奉耶稣基督之名祷告。阿们。amen。
