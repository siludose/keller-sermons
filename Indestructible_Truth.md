## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I was reading Ezekiel recently and Ezekiel got to, was with the exiles and he was in  a far off land and a lot of his, a lot of his fellow Jews were saying how can we worship  God in a strange land and he got this vision? You're read it. It's strange, but the most important thing about Ezekiel's vision is he sees God high  and lifted up and he sees them on his throne, but there's something different about Ezekiel's  vision than Isaiah's vision or anybody else's vision of the throne of God. If you look to the bottom of the throne, he found that God's throne had wheels.

It was a mobile God and it was a, it was God's way of saying I can make you a home that you  when I can dwell in absolutely anywhere, absolutely anywhere. So welcome home. And let me read to you Isaiah 52, 13 verses, from 13 down to the end of chapter 53, 52, 13  to 53, see my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled  at him. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man in his form, marred beyond human  likeness.

So will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what  they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand. Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoe and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we  should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering.

Like one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken  by God, smitten by him and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment  that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the Lord has  laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth.

He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers his silent,  so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for  he was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people, he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with a wicked and with a help and with the rich in his death  though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord  makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and  the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied.

By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with  the strong because he poured out his life on the death and was numbered with the transgressors  for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. This is God's word. There's a little bit of a guess that there's new people here tonight that haven't been part  of any series and this is actually part of a series and we've been actually talking  about what's wrong with us. I mean the human race.

Captain I just watched a video of a movie I think it came out last year was just called  Paradise Road, true story of a prison of war camp in Sumatra, World War II and all  of those true stories, whether it's the book Shanton Compound by Langdon Gilgi or the  accounts of the death cast by Victor Frankel or this movie, they're gripping of course  but there's a whole lot more than that. What happened in the Holocaust? What happened in World War II? What happened on the battlefield, what happened in the prison camp was this, the optimistic  views of human nature that were very very prevalent for about a hundred years before that in  the West. The optimistic views, the views that said basically evil is a matter of a bad family  nurturing or a lack of education or not the right socialization process or just false  consciousness.

All those kinds of optimistic approaches were devastated. They were devastated because when you're in the midst of one of those experiences, when  you're in the midst of, when they were in the midst of World War II, two questions keep  coming up. See, what's wrong with us that we're capable of this and what are we going to do about  it? What's wrong with us and how can we address it and what's interesting about this chapter,  it's very easy to forget who this was written to. There's a lot of disagreement among scholars about the book of Isaiah but one thing everybody's  in agreement about is Isaiah chapter 40 through 55 was written for a nation that was facing  exile was written to the Israelites who were about to face all the stuff we're talking  about, captivity, atrocities, prison.

And it was written to them to answer the same two questions, what's wrong with the human  race and what are we going to do about it and this is the answer, maybe the best answer,  maybe the most famous answer in the Bible to the question about human evil. Here's the answer, God sending somebody, the servant of the Lord and what we learn  in, we take a look at the text is we learn who he is, why he came and what he did, pretty  much everything, right? Who he is, why he came, what he did, let's take a look, first of all who he is. Now there's a little, there's a lot in this passage and when we get to the top, you see  it pretty straight off the bat, it says see my servant will act wisely, he'll be raised  and lifted up and highly exalted. Now actually that's the same terminology that describe the one that Isaiah saw in the  temple, back in Isaiah 6, when it says, I went to the temple and I saw the Lord high and  lifted up the same words, it's got to do with the transcendence, the transcendent majesty  of God, it's got to do with the purity, the perfection, it's amazing that the same terms  would be attached to this person, but the real amazing thing is verse 1, and you don't  notice it right off the bat and there's a number of ways to translate it, let me just  tell you what he's saying, verse 1, who has believed our message and to whom has the  arm of the Lord been revealed.

Now let me give you a little bit of a paraphrase of this, what he's saying is who has believed  our message, that this is the arm of the Lord, it's going to take revelation, Isaiah is  saying, nobody's going to believe that this one, this servant, is the arm of the Lord,  nobody's going to believe it, and here's why, the arm of the Lord is not just a kind of  nice metaphor that Isaiah came up with on the spot, the arm of the Lord is a specific,  has a very specific, very definite meaning in the Hebrew Bible and also especially in the  book of Isaiah. The arm of the Lord is the Lord himself come into history to do something concrete. The arm of the Lord is what moved the Red Sea, part of the Red Sea. See, the arm of the Lord is not God's strength in general, of course arm, if it was the eye  of the Lord we'd be talking about the knowledge of God, but the arm of the Lord is the power  of God, but not just any kind of power, it's not just general strength, it's God's power  in history. And no wonder Isaiah says, look, I know people aren't going to believe it, nobody's going  to believe that this is the arm of the Lord reveal, this is the arm of the Lord.

This person is the omnipotent God come into history. Now before we move on, we've got to move on, let me just say what's neat about this passage,  it's got to do with essentials. In fact, the more I look at this, who is why he came, you know, what he came to do. This really gets a kind of essential definition, this whole passage for example, you know, Aristotle  brought us the distinction between what he called the essence and the accidents, the essentials  and the accidentals. So for example, what if you've never seen clay, you've never seen steel before in your life?

And I put in front of you a ball of clay and a steel-eye beam and I said, okay, what's  the difference between clay and steel? And you looked and said, I got it, clay is round, steel is long. And you'd say, it's hard to laugh in here, isn't it, but try. Okay, you know, you can laugh under curly cues. You don't just need graffiti, okay, now, that's better.

You'd say, you've missed the essence, those are accidentals, it's sort of an accident. Clay can take numbers of shapes, but the shape is an essential, shape is not essential. It's the, you know, it's softness, hardness, chemical composition, all that kind of thing. Now, what's the essence of Christianity? Well, you say Christianity leads people to love one another.

Yeah, yeah, but hey, there's a lot of people who aren't Christians that are very loving. Well, Christianity leads you, it gives you strength, gives you peace, makes you good. Yeah, but those are accidental. I don't mean they're accidents. I'm using it in the Aristotelian terms, they're not, they're not the essential.

They're not, they overlap with lots of other groups of people. What's essential? The armeness of Christianity. What do I mean? All right, here's what I mean.

Jesus Christ is not here called the mouth of God, the mouth of the Lord. He's called the arm of the Lord. That doesn't mean he didn't come to teach. He's a teacher, but it didn't primarily come to tell you what to do. He came primarily to do.

And that's the essential difference between Christianity and every other religion. Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God. Do this.

Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it. It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice. You see, the other founders come with advice and they say, hey, here's how you can change your life. But news is this is what's happened that changes your life.

Now, if I, what? Some of you may have heard me say this before, but let me put it to another way that I think brings it home. The stories of Christianity don't work unless they're true. Whereas the stories of other religions work anyway. See, for example, what's the purpose of Buddhism?

What's Buddhism about? It's about enlightenment. It's a wonderful faith. It's got lots of great stuff to teach us, it's about enlightenment. And it's about an attitude toward life, an attitude toward suffering, an attitude toward not grasping and working against the craving ego.

So all the stories about Buddha, does it matter if they're true or not? No, it doesn't. Here's why. I mean, they might be, they may not be. The point is, they're inspiring and they're exemplary.

They tell me how to find enlightenment. They tell me how to live and they work with their true or not. Muhammad, in many no disrespect anybody, but take a look at the stories of Muhammad. What is Islam about? Well, the word Islam means submission, obedience, not so much enlightenment, obedience to Allah.

So all the stories about Muhammad work in this. Whether they're true or not, they show me how to submit, they show me what to do, right? So they work. Let's look at the stories of Christianity. Okay, let's look at the Christmas story, born in a manger.

Okay, what's the moral of that story? Have natural childbirth? What's the moral? Homelessness is fine. What's the moral?

Listen, there is no moral. The story is this, the arm of the Lord. The ideal has broken into history. It's become real. Finally, and this has happened and it's changes everything.

Well, in fact, let me, let's get more to the point. Let's take a look at the story in front of us, the cross. There's a Christian story. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Now, what's the moral of that story?

If that story's not true, think about this for a second. You say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's true. It's just, it's inspirational. Oh, really? Let's think about this for a minute.

What's the moral of the story? Don't protect yourself. You're the victim of what, is it say, oppression? When oppression comes to you, you just give in. You just let them walk all over you.

You don't open your mouth, you don't protest. Just let injustice roll over you, is that? Is that the moral of the story? That's perverse. You know, there's another way to put it, okay?

I put it to you like this. Let's just say you and I have gone to the top  of the Empire State Building. And we're looking out there and all of a sudden,  you come to me and say, Tim, I just want you to know  how much I love you. I want you to know how much I care for you  and I'm gonna show you how much I love you. And you get up on the ledge and you say, watch.

And you throw yourself off and down you go to your death. And I do I look over the ledge and I say,  look how that person loves me. How do I do I? No, I was, what's wrong with that person? But what if I, because I'm stupid  or because I'm a fool or something,  what if I get to the edge myself  and I'm about to fall off and you come over  and you push me to safety but in the process you fall?

Now listen, the crucifixion is something  has happened in history that changes everything. The servant has come to take your punishment,  changes everything. If it's not true, it's not just unimportant, it's bad. It's not just that the story doesn't work. If it's not true, it actually works badly.

It's a perverse, it's a, it's pernicious. Unless the story's a Christianity or true,  unless Jesus Christ is the arm and not just the mouth. See, Christianity is really bad for you. Very, very bad, terrible. It's one of the other, he is the arm of the Lord.

Okay, that's who came. It's God himself acting in history. Second, that's who he came and the wider he comes now. Again, we're getting into essence  because the reason he came and his look,  verses four through six, there's a whole sleut  of a great vocabulary where it's a whole survey  of almost every kind of way to describe human evil. Sin, look, you've got infirmities.

See, transgressions andiquities. By the way, some of you, of all the words,  by the way, that's almost my favorite one  because you know what? The Hebrew word translated iniquity, it's a shame. It doesn't come across in English at all. It means bent, bent, okay?

Bent means it doesn't work,  but if you try to unbend, it'll just make it worse. It'll break. But in the midst of all of these interesting words,  there's one that kind of gets at the essence  of what's wrong with us. So this is the answer to the question. What's wrong with us?

Here it is. Verse six, very famous, but overlooked. All we like sheep have gone astray,  each of us has turned to his own way. Now you say my word, this is the central place  where God is telling us the secrets  of what's wrong with us, of human evil. This is a definition of evil.

This is a definition of sin, own way. My word you say, I mean, you know,  why not murder or robbery or something like that? I mean, every little kid wants their own way. I'm glad you said that. Look, a friend of mine who's, he's a lifetime bachelor.

He's a preacher and I listen to his sermons. And but since he's a lifetime bachelor,  when he actually comes across children,  he's always struck by them in a way that I don't,  any more because I've, you know,  being a parent I'm sort of surrounded by them. One day he was at a retreat and he was walking  with a whole family of five and he were walking along  and they were on their way to a pony corral. And the parents were saying to Charles,  there was Charles and Sarah and Sally. And the parents said, now Charles,  you rode the pony all morning.

It's Sarah and Sally's turn. So it's their turn. And he said, oh, he nodded his head. They rounded a turn. They got near the corral.

And as soon as they got near the corral,  Charles dart off ahead of everybody, ran into the crowd,  ran up to the staff person who was in charge of it,  and said, me first. And my friend, you know, this profound,  what kind of illustration is this? But he was amazed by it. Yeah, I'm amazed. But then he suddenly thought about it.

He says, well, wait a minute. What if this is the unbelievable heart  of every microchip in the soul of every human being? Can never be put out? What if this is essential? Well, there's many, many, many accidental.

I mean, there's many forms of it. But what if this is something we can never delete? He says, if me first, basically, is what's wrong? What are death camps? What is war?

What is every single crime? What is every crime? Come on. What's the essence of every crime? Me first.

That's it. I mean, years ago, Burger King had a song. Remember, it had a little ditty. It said, have it your way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin.

Frank Sinatra sang, I did it my way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin. But now, look, it's not just very helpful. Very helpful showing us, basically, my way. Me first, how that shows what our relationships  with each other, but essentially,  it shows us our relationship with God.

Because it doesn't say we are all like snakes,  gone to our own way. Snakes know their way. Sheep need a shepherd. And when sheep want to go their own way,  what they're saying is, I want to be my own shepherd. And when a human being goes its own way,  what we're saying is, I want to be my own maker.

We're not totally sure whether Psalm 100 booted off  of Isaiah 53 or whether I Isaiah 53 boots off of Psalm 100. But I hear, listen, Psalm 100 says,  know that the Lord is God. It is He who has made us and not we ourselves  for where is people, the sheep of this pasture. Now, very simple, listen. This is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea  to think so much of sin in terms of breaking rules.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness,  wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world  and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. If you say sin is breaking rules, God's rules,  and that's partly, that's one perspective,  but if you start there, here's the problem. Let's just say you just cheated on the test. You get cheated on the test. Well, that's something like robbery.

So you think of sin and you can actually say,  well, it's just a very small sin. You just, you know, it seems so insignificant. And therefore, you're thinking of sin  sort of like a pile of ceramic pots. And they're all on the pile and you throw a baseball  into the pile and you break one. Whoops, you go on over, take it away.

Who's going to know the difference? I mean, the pile is intact, basically. But sin is much more like throwing a baseball through a window. Either the window is intact or it's shattered. And here's the point, either God is God in your life.

Either he calls the shots, you might say. Either you let him be God. It's another way to put it. Or else you're God in your life. And we put it three ways.

First of all, either your will is law and his will is advice. Or see, his will is law and your will is advice. Let me put it another way. If you say aloe bay, when it makes sense to me,  if it fits in with my opinion of what is good for me,  if it fits my feelings,  if you say aloe bay, if what you're saying is,  my will, my wisdom, my goals,  sit in judgment on God's. If you say aloe bay, no matter what,  aloe bay, if it kills me, aloe bay,  if I'm the last person on the earth that does,  aloe bay, no matter what it costs me,  aloe bay, whether I understand it or not,  aloe bay, whether it's practical or not,  aloe bay, whether it's relevant or not,  then and only then.

You're saying God's wisdom,  God's will and God's goals sit in judgment on mine. Now it's one of the other. There's no in between. It's not like you break a couple of rules,  but basically the piles intact. It's a principle of God's godness.

Who's the shepherd? Who's the sheep? Who's the Lord? Who's the servant? Who's will is law?

And who's will is advice? It's one of the other. There's nothing in the middle. Nothing at all. And this is what's so interesting.

It says, if you decide you're going to be  the call to shots in your own life,  this isn't so much,  hey, this is not so much, for example,  cheating on a test. This is essentially living for your own happiness,  living for your own comfort,  living for your own glory. Just making your decisions without reference to God,  just ignoring God is that you've broken the glass. You've bent your soul. Nothing's going to work.

If you read through here,  and I don't have time to do it,  your emotions won't work. It tells you that. Your intellect won't work. He was steamed him not. We thought he was zero.

That's literally what it means. Your emotions don't work. When you look at him,  you don't desire him. I mean, nothing will work. Now, one more before we go on to the last point.

That's why he came. He came because there's some undeleteable,  seemingly insignificant thing  on the external microchip of every human heart,  which is,  I want to be God. I want to be my own God. Me first,  which is the cause of all the misery. That's why he came.

But one little thing. Think about this for a second. Christians are often accused of  having their head in the sand intellectually,  and by the way,  it's true. However,  it's awfully easy,  more than easy. The average person  when it comes to their relationship with God  definitely has his or her head in the sand.

Here's why I want to put it. Here's how I want to put it. According to this. If God's your maker. If God made you.

If you've been created by God. You owe him everything. Absolutely everything. You owe it to have him be the one who calls all shots. Right?

Otherwise,  you're bent. Otherwise,  it's terrible. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's stupid.

You're going to die as certainly as those  shaped sheep that think they can be shepherds will die. So,  if, see,  if God made you,  then you have to go all the way with him. Totally is God being number one. If he did not make you,  then it's warranted for you to go your own way. If you haven't been created by anybody,  of course you belong to yourself.

But then your life's meaningless. And if you're not created, you're an accident. You came without purpose into the world. No matter what you do,  everything's going to rot. Everything's going to burn up.

You do make any difference. And if your origin isn't significant,  and your destiny isn't significant,  have the intellectual guts to admit your life isn't significant,  and this is all you've got. If you've been made,  you have to give everything to him. If you haven't given everything to him,  then your life is utterly meaningless. And that's it.

You're either bent or you're meaningless. It's one or the other. And almost nobody thinks like that. Because almost nobody will say,  if everybody I know that says,  well, I have to decide what's right or wrong for me. They won't say, well, that means my life is utterly meaningless.

Or I am bending myself against the very God who made me. You don't do that. What do you say? Well, you just go along with what everybody else is saying. You're not thinking it out at all.

You're heads in the sand. Now, you're unconscious. Know something about it. It's something here. Am I still on?

Yeah. I think I kicked something, pardon me. You're unconscious. Your semi-conscious knows. It's why your Garcals at the sickness under death.

Sarger calls it nausea. Deep down inside, you know this. Either there's a God now. I'm absolutely everything. Or I don't.

I can be my own maker. And there's no meaning for anything. One or the other. Well, almost nobody thinks that out. You don't want to think it out.

But I'm respectfully asking you to think it out. Now, lastly. See? Who he is? Why he came?

What he did. Now, what we have here is one more essence. You know, the essence of who he is, Arm Noble Lord. The essence of sin. What is the essence of sin?

Didn't really define it. Did I? The essence of sin is us substituting ourselves for God. Putting ourselves into places where only God deserves to be in your own life. Well, then what's the essence of salvation?

And the answer is right here in verse 4, 5 and 6. It's God substituting himself for us. This is the meaning of life, substitution. Look, first of all, in verse 4, it says,  pardon me, verse 5, he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities.

Now, in Hebrew doesn't say 4. He just wouldn't work in English to put out exactly what it says in Hebrew. It says he was pierced from our transgressions. He was crushed from our iniquities. And that's the Hebrew way of saying he was crushed as a result of.

See, it's what it's actually that he was pierced as a result. Wait, wait, wait. Our transgression, consequence, goes to him. See, our iniquity, consequence, goes to him. And then, look down here, verse 11.

Whoops, sorry, look over here, verse 11. It says, by his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many. My righteous servant will justify many. You know what the word justification means? You think about it.

In English, it works. What if you make a statement, and I don't like it, or I'm upset by it,  or I don't, that's why I come to you, and I say,  you made a statement, justify that statement. And you say, well, let me explain, and you make some explanations. And I say, oh, fine. Okay, good.

You justified. That's fine. What did you just do? Did you change the statement? No.

You didn't change it a bit. You didn't change the word. You didn't change the letter. But what you did do, you changed my attitude toward it. You changed my relationship to it.

When it says that our transgressions have gone, have, have, have a cause,  and the cause of the transgressions have gone to him. It's also saying he is of the perfect life,  and the cause, the consequence of that perfect life, will come to us. Just as God, here, the essence of being a Christian. What's the essence of being a Christian? Trying hard to live like Jesus?

No, that's a consequence. In fact, in most of our cases, that's an accident. What's the essence? When Jesus, you know, a second Corinthians 521,  is absolutely summarizing all of Isaiah 53, here's how it goes. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

What does that mean? What does it mean to say Jesus Christ became sin? Does that mean he became sinful? No. Does that mean he became wicked and nasty and awful?

No. What does it mean? It means he was treated by God as if he'd done every bloody thing  the humanity had ever done. Well, then what does it mean to become righteous in him? I know what most of you think.

You say, I want to become a Christian. I'm going to have to clean up my act. Well, yes, you are, but that's not the essence. What makes you a Christian is that the moment you believe in him  and you say, Father, for Jesus' sake,  because of what he did in history, except me. That moment, according to this,  it means every God gives you credit for absolutely everything  that Jesus ever did.

One of the things that comes out in here,  and you say, how could that be? Let me show you. One of the things that comes out in here  is the voluntariness of Jesus' death. Well, the voluntariness of his death comes out when it says,  he took up our infirmities, very active word. He picked them off of us in a sense and put them on himself.

Or all these places where he opened not his mouth,  he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth. What is all that? He's voluntary. He voluntarily died. Well, you say plenty of people voluntarily died.

No, they haven't. Nobody voluntarily died by Jesus. Let me say, have there people who,  given their lives for others,  those people who committed suicide? No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

They voluntarily... No. What they did was they chose, when did I? They didn't choose to die. You can't choose to die.

You're going to die. They choose how to die. They didn't choose to die. Even when you say, I choose to die and you commit suicide,  you're still a victim of death. You haven't chosen to die.

You were going to die. You could never have stopped it. You could never have held it off. Jesus is the only person who ever died who wasn't a victim of death. Jesus is the only person who ever died voluntarily.

The only person who didn't have to die. Ever have to die. Jesus was beautiful and he voluntarily became ugly. Jesus was unlimited and he voluntarily became limited. Jesus was eternal and he voluntarily died.

It was an act of supreme authority. That's the reason why one guy says Jesus Christ alone. His death was like this. It's almost as if Jesus Christ took his body in one hand  and his soul in one hand and tore himself apart. He says, I lay my life down according to all my own accord.

Now what does that mean? Well, it means something for your heart and something for your understanding  and then we're going to end. Here's the thing it means for your heart. The heart. What held Jesus to the cross?

Think about it. What held Him to the cross? I mean, there's a lot of people who died for other people. Those that they can move you. Something deep in our soul tells us substitution is the meaning of life.

Whenever you get near it in a story, you know,  the movie version of the screenplay of the last of the Mohicans. Remember, the women are about to be killed and incomes, you know,  you know, Daniel Dei Lewis, LaLonga Caribbean, you know,  Nathaniel Poe, at least in the story. And he comes and he says to the... Mary says to the Indian chief, me for her. You see, me for them, me for them.

Kill me instead of them. But he doesn't know French. You see, and he doesn't... Or he doesn't know the language. So he has to do it through an interpreter.

Remember who the interpreter is? Duncan. Duncan, the spurned shooter of one of the women. And Duncan starts speaking, but Duncan says, me for them. And they string Duncan up, remember?

And they kill him? So they can flee. And you watch that? Something moves you. This is the meaning of life.

This is something amazing. Or, you know, tale of two cities. Charles Dickens fascinating place. Cecidney Carton is in love with the woman,  but she marries Charles Darnay. But Charles Darnay is soon in prison  and he's going to be executed.

He's going to go to the guillotine. And Cidney Carton, who looks quite a bit like Charles Darnay,  comes into see Charles Darnay and says, I'm switching with you. What? And he basically knocks the man out. And he puts on the cond...

You see, he puts on the condemned man's clothes. The condemned man is given the free man's clothes. And Cidney Carton dies. And by the way, near the very end, Cidney Carton,  who's playing like his Charles Darnay,  he's in line, he's ready to go to the guillotine,  and there's a woman, there's a young girl who's there,  and says, hey, you know me, I used to be with you back in here  and back in there, and she looks up,  and she realizes it's not Charles Darnay. And her face goes white.

And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yeah. And she says, hold my hand. Somebody like you, I think I'll be able to face anything  with somebody like you. And to see, what's going on there?

There's nothing more moving than that. It's the opposite of sin. And the opposite of sin is me first. Salvation is you first. The essence of sin is, see, your life for mine.

The essence of salvation is my life for yours. And when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross,  what was holding him there? His love for you, nothing else, nothing else at all. And that means, no matter what you do,  you couldn't possibly break his love for you. Think about it.

What did it take? It took God's wrath. It took punishment. It took all this stuff. And now, some days, you're sitting around and you're saying,  I've been so inconsistent.

I've been so stupid. I've been so foolish. I've done all this. I've done that. I wonder whether Jesus is going to give up on me.

Your inconsistency, your foolishness,  is going to break poor Jesus' little love  when this wouldn't break it? This love for you took everything  hell could give and it didn't give up. He was absolutely voluntary. He gave himself for you. That's something your heart's got to know.

It's a strong love. You couldn't possibly wear it out. You couldn't possibly wear it through it. But then, here's the last thing for your understanding. This is not only something you need to know  if you need to know this for your understanding.

Jesus Christ essentially fulfilled the law of God twice  when he came to earth because he didn't just die  to fulfill the law. He lived an incredible life. In that, he voluntarily gave himself for someone else. He actually did love his neighbor. You see, completely.

Another way to put it is this. I don't know how much it costs because I have made some of you know. There's the law of the stoplight in New York City. And there's two ways to satisfy the law of the stoplight. One is stop.

The other is pay $75, I think. Either way, you satisfy the law of the stoplight. How do you satisfy the law of God? Love your God with all your heart's whole strength  and love your neighbor as yourself? Or pay the penalty?

In Jesus Christ, as he was paying the penalty,  was loving God with all his heart's whole strength  and my and his neighbor as himself. So he fulfilled the law of God twice. You see, he took our sins. That leaves his record for us, his perfect record for us. Listen, put it this way.

What does this mean to you? It means the meaning of your life is the cross in two ways. Unless the cross makes sense to you, life won't make sense. Unless you begin to see, first of all, through the cross,  you're not going to have to worry anymore so much about your comfort  because the great disease has been taken away from you forever. You don't have to worry that much about your looks  because the great beauty has been put on you forever.

You don't have to worry that much about your reputation  because the only one who matters loves you. What does that mean? It means as you go out into the world,  this stuff that used to bother you just doesn't. Suffering will happen. You'll get sick, but the great disease you see has been cured.

You'll get abused, but you see, the great reputation is yours. And so what happens is that you move on through the cross  not only gives you an emotional well to handle the problems of life,  but then secondly, it gives you the wisdom to see,  look, this is the way Jesus came. This is the weakness of the arm of the Lord. So often, the best things that happen in life are because  of through weakness and suffering and trouble and difficulty. Until the cross is the joy of your life,  life won't make sense to you.

Until the cross makes sense, life won't make sense. And then, not only is it true that the cross will make sense  of your life, the cross then becomes the pattern for your life. Here's what's so wonderful. You feel so rich if you understand the cross  that you start to live like Jesus. You basically say, not your life or mine,  my life for you, you spend yourself.

You know what's interesting about this? Suffering and oppression, he is oppressed. He is the victim of injustice. He is cut off in the land of living. He's the recipient of a violent debt.

Most of us in this room are never going to experience any of that kind of injustice. Oh, what's so great about this is this. If you don't believe in God,  injustice and suffering is a horrible problem, you know why? It's a tremendous mystery. It's a mystery why you're upset.

Because you see, if there is no God,  then the strong eating of the weak is utterly natural, totally natural. And what why aren't you God for insisting it should be some other way? This is the way it is. So he says, suffering and injustice is a terrible problem if you don't believe in God. But if you do believe in God, then it becomes a terrible problem,  because why doesn't he stop it?

But of all the gods that we have  and all the different religions that are at least presented to us,  there's only one God who's been involved. So when any other God says, I've got good reasons, you know,  it sounds pretty hollow. But when you have a God who actually was the victim of injustice,  you better trust Him. And you better start living your life for other people who have been through the same thing. My life for yours.

This is the essence of being a Christian. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place. We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is,  and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now.

We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice,  not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims. A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives,  not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord.

And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you,  you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I was reading Ezekiel recently and Ezekiel got to, was with the exiles and he was in  a far off land and a lot of his, a lot of his fellow Jews were saying how can we worship  God in a strange land and he got this vision? You're read it. It's strange, but the most important thing about Ezekiel's vision is he sees God high  and lifted up and he sees them on his throne, but there's something different about Ezekiel's  vision than Isaiah's vision or anybody else's vision of the throne of God. If you look to the bottom of the throne, he found that God's throne had wheels.

It was a mobile God and it was a, it was God's way of saying I can make you a home that you  when I can dwell in absolutely anywhere, absolutely anywhere. So welcome home. And let me read to you Isaiah 52, 13 verses, from 13 down to the end of chapter 53, 52, 13  to 53, see my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled  at him. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man in his form, marred beyond human  likeness.

So will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what  they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand. Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoe and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we  should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering.

Like one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken  by God, smitten by him and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment  that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the Lord has  laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth.

He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers his silent,  so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for  he was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people, he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with a wicked and with a help and with the rich in his death  though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord  makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and  the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied.

By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with  the strong because he poured out his life on the death and was numbered with the transgressors  for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. This is God's word. There's a little bit of a guess that there's new people here tonight that haven't been part  of any series and this is actually part of a series and we've been actually talking  about what's wrong with us. I mean the human race.

Captain I just watched a video of a movie I think it came out last year was just called  Paradise Road, true story of a prison of war camp in Sumatra, World War II and all  of those true stories, whether it's the book Shanton Compound by Langdon Gilgi or the  accounts of the death cast by Victor Frankel or this movie, they're gripping of course  but there's a whole lot more than that. What happened in the Holocaust? What happened in World War II? What happened on the battlefield, what happened in the prison camp was this, the optimistic  views of human nature that were very very prevalent for about a hundred years before that in  the West. The optimistic views, the views that said basically evil is a matter of a bad family  nurturing or a lack of education or not the right socialization process or just false  consciousness.

All those kinds of optimistic approaches were devastated. They were devastated because when you're in the midst of one of those experiences, when  you're in the midst of, when they were in the midst of World War II, two questions keep  coming up. See, what's wrong with us that we're capable of this and what are we going to do about  it? What's wrong with us and how can we address it and what's interesting about this chapter,  it's very easy to forget who this was written to. There's a lot of disagreement among scholars about the book of Isaiah but one thing everybody's  in agreement about is Isaiah chapter 40 through 55 was written for a nation that was facing  exile was written to the Israelites who were about to face all the stuff we're talking  about, captivity, atrocities, prison.

And it was written to them to answer the same two questions, what's wrong with the human  race and what are we going to do about it and this is the answer, maybe the best answer,  maybe the most famous answer in the Bible to the question about human evil. Here's the answer, God sending somebody, the servant of the Lord and what we learn  in, we take a look at the text is we learn who he is, why he came and what he did, pretty  much everything, right? Who he is, why he came, what he did, let's take a look, first of all who he is. Now there's a little, there's a lot in this passage and when we get to the top, you see  it pretty straight off the bat, it says see my servant will act wisely, he'll be raised  and lifted up and highly exalted. Now actually that's the same terminology that describe the one that Isaiah saw in the  temple, back in Isaiah 6, when it says, I went to the temple and I saw the Lord high and  lifted up the same words, it's got to do with the transcendence, the transcendent majesty  of God, it's got to do with the purity, the perfection, it's amazing that the same terms  would be attached to this person, but the real amazing thing is verse 1, and you don't  notice it right off the bat and there's a number of ways to translate it, let me just  tell you what he's saying, verse 1, who has believed our message and to whom has the  arm of the Lord been revealed.

Now let me give you a little bit of a paraphrase of this, what he's saying is who has believed  our message, that this is the arm of the Lord, it's going to take revelation, Isaiah is  saying, nobody's going to believe that this one, this servant, is the arm of the Lord,  nobody's going to believe it, and here's why, the arm of the Lord is not just a kind of  nice metaphor that Isaiah came up with on the spot, the arm of the Lord is a specific,  has a very specific, very definite meaning in the Hebrew Bible and also especially in the  book of Isaiah. The arm of the Lord is the Lord himself come into history to do something concrete. The arm of the Lord is what moved the Red Sea, part of the Red Sea. See, the arm of the Lord is not God's strength in general, of course arm, if it was the eye  of the Lord we'd be talking about the knowledge of God, but the arm of the Lord is the power  of God, but not just any kind of power, it's not just general strength, it's God's power  in history. And no wonder Isaiah says, look, I know people aren't going to believe it, nobody's going  to believe that this is the arm of the Lord reveal, this is the arm of the Lord.

This person is the omnipotent God come into history. Now before we move on, we've got to move on, let me just say what's neat about this passage,  it's got to do with essentials. In fact, the more I look at this, who is why he came, you know, what he came to do. This really gets a kind of essential definition, this whole passage for example, you know, Aristotle  brought us the distinction between what he called the essence and the accidents, the essentials  and the accidentals. So for example, what if you've never seen clay, you've never seen steel before in your life?

And I put in front of you a ball of clay and a steel-eye beam and I said, okay, what's  the difference between clay and steel? And you looked and said, I got it, clay is round, steel is long. And you'd say, it's hard to laugh in here, isn't it, but try. Okay, you know, you can laugh under curly cues. You don't just need graffiti, okay, now, that's better.

You'd say, you've missed the essence, those are accidentals, it's sort of an accident. Clay can take numbers of shapes, but the shape is an essential, shape is not essential. It's the, you know, it's softness, hardness, chemical composition, all that kind of thing. Now, what's the essence of Christianity? Well, you say Christianity leads people to love one another.

Yeah, yeah, but hey, there's a lot of people who aren't Christians that are very loving. Well, Christianity leads you, it gives you strength, gives you peace, makes you good. Yeah, but those are accidental. I don't mean they're accidents. I'm using it in the Aristotelian terms, they're not, they're not the essential.

They're not, they overlap with lots of other groups of people. What's essential? The armeness of Christianity. What do I mean? All right, here's what I mean.

Jesus Christ is not here called the mouth of God, the mouth of the Lord. He's called the arm of the Lord. That doesn't mean he didn't come to teach. He's a teacher, but it didn't primarily come to tell you what to do. He came primarily to do.

And that's the essential difference between Christianity and every other religion. Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God. Do this.

Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it. It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice. You see, the other founders come with advice and they say, hey, here's how you can change your life. But news is this is what's happened that changes your life.

Now, if I, what? Some of you may have heard me say this before, but let me put it to another way that I think brings it home. The stories of Christianity don't work unless they're true. Whereas the stories of other religions work anyway. See, for example, what's the purpose of Buddhism?

What's Buddhism about? It's about enlightenment. It's a wonderful faith. It's got lots of great stuff to teach us, it's about enlightenment. And it's about an attitude toward life, an attitude toward suffering, an attitude toward not grasping and working against the craving ego.

So all the stories about Buddha, does it matter if they're true or not? No, it doesn't. Here's why. I mean, they might be, they may not be. The point is, they're inspiring and they're exemplary.

They tell me how to find enlightenment. They tell me how to live and they work with their true or not. Muhammad, in many no disrespect anybody, but take a look at the stories of Muhammad. What is Islam about? Well, the word Islam means submission, obedience, not so much enlightenment, obedience to Allah.

So all the stories about Muhammad work in this. Whether they're true or not, they show me how to submit, they show me what to do, right? So they work. Let's look at the stories of Christianity. Okay, let's look at the Christmas story, born in a manger.

Okay, what's the moral of that story? Have natural childbirth? What's the moral? Homelessness is fine. What's the moral?

Listen, there is no moral. The story is this, the arm of the Lord. The ideal has broken into history. It's become real. Finally, and this has happened and it's changes everything.

Well, in fact, let me, let's get more to the point. Let's take a look at the story in front of us, the cross. There's a Christian story. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Now, what's the moral of that story?

If that story's not true, think about this for a second. You say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's true. It's just, it's inspirational. Oh, really? Let's think about this for a minute.

What's the moral of the story? Don't protect yourself. You're the victim of what, is it say, oppression? When oppression comes to you, you just give in. You just let them walk all over you.

You don't open your mouth, you don't protest. Just let injustice roll over you, is that? Is that the moral of the story? That's perverse. You know, there's another way to put it, okay?

I put it to you like this. Let's just say you and I have gone to the top  of the Empire State Building. And we're looking out there and all of a sudden,  you come to me and say, Tim, I just want you to know  how much I love you. I want you to know how much I care for you  and I'm gonna show you how much I love you. And you get up on the ledge and you say, watch.

And you throw yourself off and down you go to your death. And I do I look over the ledge and I say,  look how that person loves me. How do I do I? No, I was, what's wrong with that person? But what if I, because I'm stupid  or because I'm a fool or something,  what if I get to the edge myself  and I'm about to fall off and you come over  and you push me to safety but in the process you fall?

Now listen, the crucifixion is something  has happened in history that changes everything. The servant has come to take your punishment,  changes everything. If it's not true, it's not just unimportant, it's bad. It's not just that the story doesn't work. If it's not true, it actually works badly.

It's a perverse, it's a, it's pernicious. Unless the story's a Christianity or true,  unless Jesus Christ is the arm and not just the mouth. See, Christianity is really bad for you. Very, very bad, terrible. It's one of the other, he is the arm of the Lord.

Okay, that's who came. It's God himself acting in history. Second, that's who he came and the wider he comes now. Again, we're getting into essence  because the reason he came and his look,  verses four through six, there's a whole sleut  of a great vocabulary where it's a whole survey  of almost every kind of way to describe human evil. Sin, look, you've got infirmities.

See, transgressions andiquities. By the way, some of you, of all the words,  by the way, that's almost my favorite one  because you know what? The Hebrew word translated iniquity, it's a shame. It doesn't come across in English at all. It means bent, bent, okay?

Bent means it doesn't work,  but if you try to unbend, it'll just make it worse. It'll break. But in the midst of all of these interesting words,  there's one that kind of gets at the essence  of what's wrong with us. So this is the answer to the question. What's wrong with us?

Here it is. Verse six, very famous, but overlooked. All we like sheep have gone astray,  each of us has turned to his own way. Now you say my word, this is the central place  where God is telling us the secrets  of what's wrong with us, of human evil. This is a definition of evil.

This is a definition of sin, own way. My word you say, I mean, you know,  why not murder or robbery or something like that? I mean, every little kid wants their own way. I'm glad you said that. Look, a friend of mine who's, he's a lifetime bachelor.

He's a preacher and I listen to his sermons. And but since he's a lifetime bachelor,  when he actually comes across children,  he's always struck by them in a way that I don't,  any more because I've, you know,  being a parent I'm sort of surrounded by them. One day he was at a retreat and he was walking  with a whole family of five and he were walking along  and they were on their way to a pony corral. And the parents were saying to Charles,  there was Charles and Sarah and Sally. And the parents said, now Charles,  you rode the pony all morning.

It's Sarah and Sally's turn. So it's their turn. And he said, oh, he nodded his head. They rounded a turn. They got near the corral.

And as soon as they got near the corral,  Charles dart off ahead of everybody, ran into the crowd,  ran up to the staff person who was in charge of it,  and said, me first. And my friend, you know, this profound,  what kind of illustration is this? But he was amazed by it. Yeah, I'm amazed. But then he suddenly thought about it.

He says, well, wait a minute. What if this is the unbelievable heart  of every microchip in the soul of every human being? Can never be put out? What if this is essential? Well, there's many, many, many accidental.

I mean, there's many forms of it. But what if this is something we can never delete? He says, if me first, basically, is what's wrong? What are death camps? What is war?

What is every single crime? What is every crime? Come on. What's the essence of every crime? Me first.

That's it. I mean, years ago, Burger King had a song. Remember, it had a little ditty. It said, have it your way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin.

Frank Sinatra sang, I did it my way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin. But now, look, it's not just very helpful. Very helpful showing us, basically, my way. Me first, how that shows what our relationships  with each other, but essentially,  it shows us our relationship with God.

Because it doesn't say we are all like snakes,  gone to our own way. Snakes know their way. Sheep need a shepherd. And when sheep want to go their own way,  what they're saying is, I want to be my own shepherd. And when a human being goes its own way,  what we're saying is, I want to be my own maker.

We're not totally sure whether Psalm 100 booted off  of Isaiah 53 or whether I Isaiah 53 boots off of Psalm 100. But I hear, listen, Psalm 100 says,  know that the Lord is God. It is He who has made us and not we ourselves  for where is people, the sheep of this pasture. Now, very simple, listen. This is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea  to think so much of sin in terms of breaking rules.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness,  wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world  and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. If you say sin is breaking rules, God's rules,  and that's partly, that's one perspective,  but if you start there, here's the problem. Let's just say you just cheated on the test. You get cheated on the test. Well, that's something like robbery.

So you think of sin and you can actually say,  well, it's just a very small sin. You just, you know, it seems so insignificant. And therefore, you're thinking of sin  sort of like a pile of ceramic pots. And they're all on the pile and you throw a baseball  into the pile and you break one. Whoops, you go on over, take it away.

Who's going to know the difference? I mean, the pile is intact, basically. But sin is much more like throwing a baseball through a window. Either the window is intact or it's shattered. And here's the point, either God is God in your life.

Either he calls the shots, you might say. Either you let him be God. It's another way to put it. Or else you're God in your life. And we put it three ways.

First of all, either your will is law and his will is advice. Or see, his will is law and your will is advice. Let me put it another way. If you say aloe bay, when it makes sense to me,  if it fits in with my opinion of what is good for me,  if it fits my feelings,  if you say aloe bay, if what you're saying is,  my will, my wisdom, my goals,  sit in judgment on God's. If you say aloe bay, no matter what,  aloe bay, if it kills me, aloe bay,  if I'm the last person on the earth that does,  aloe bay, no matter what it costs me,  aloe bay, whether I understand it or not,  aloe bay, whether it's practical or not,  aloe bay, whether it's relevant or not,  then and only then.

You're saying God's wisdom,  God's will and God's goals sit in judgment on mine. Now it's one of the other. There's no in between. It's not like you break a couple of rules,  but basically the piles intact. It's a principle of God's godness.

Who's the shepherd? Who's the sheep? Who's the Lord? Who's the servant? Who's will is law?

And who's will is advice? It's one of the other. There's nothing in the middle. Nothing at all. And this is what's so interesting.

It says, if you decide you're going to be  the call to shots in your own life,  this isn't so much,  hey, this is not so much, for example,  cheating on a test. This is essentially living for your own happiness,  living for your own comfort,  living for your own glory. Just making your decisions without reference to God,  just ignoring God is that you've broken the glass. You've bent your soul. Nothing's going to work.

If you read through here,  and I don't have time to do it,  your emotions won't work. It tells you that. Your intellect won't work. He was steamed him not. We thought he was zero.

That's literally what it means. Your emotions don't work. When you look at him,  you don't desire him. I mean, nothing will work. Now, one more before we go on to the last point.

That's why he came. He came because there's some undeleteable,  seemingly insignificant thing  on the external microchip of every human heart,  which is,  I want to be God. I want to be my own God. Me first,  which is the cause of all the misery. That's why he came.

But one little thing. Think about this for a second. Christians are often accused of  having their head in the sand intellectually,  and by the way,  it's true. However,  it's awfully easy,  more than easy. The average person  when it comes to their relationship with God  definitely has his or her head in the sand.

Here's why I want to put it. Here's how I want to put it. According to this. If God's your maker. If God made you.

If you've been created by God. You owe him everything. Absolutely everything. You owe it to have him be the one who calls all shots. Right?

Otherwise,  you're bent. Otherwise,  it's terrible. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's stupid.

You're going to die as certainly as those  shaped sheep that think they can be shepherds will die. So,  if, see,  if God made you,  then you have to go all the way with him. Totally is God being number one. If he did not make you,  then it's warranted for you to go your own way. If you haven't been created by anybody,  of course you belong to yourself.

But then your life's meaningless. And if you're not created, you're an accident. You came without purpose into the world. No matter what you do,  everything's going to rot. Everything's going to burn up.

You do make any difference. And if your origin isn't significant,  and your destiny isn't significant,  have the intellectual guts to admit your life isn't significant,  and this is all you've got. If you've been made,  you have to give everything to him. If you haven't given everything to him,  then your life is utterly meaningless. And that's it.

You're either bent or you're meaningless. It's one or the other. And almost nobody thinks like that. Because almost nobody will say,  if everybody I know that says,  well, I have to decide what's right or wrong for me. They won't say, well, that means my life is utterly meaningless.

Or I am bending myself against the very God who made me. You don't do that. What do you say? Well, you just go along with what everybody else is saying. You're not thinking it out at all.

You're heads in the sand. Now, you're unconscious. Know something about it. It's something here. Am I still on?

Yeah. I think I kicked something, pardon me. You're unconscious. Your semi-conscious knows. It's why your Garcals at the sickness under death.

Sarger calls it nausea. Deep down inside, you know this. Either there's a God now. I'm absolutely everything. Or I don't.

I can be my own maker. And there's no meaning for anything. One or the other. Well, almost nobody thinks that out. You don't want to think it out.

But I'm respectfully asking you to think it out. Now, lastly. See? Who he is? Why he came?

What he did. Now, what we have here is one more essence. You know, the essence of who he is, Arm Noble Lord. The essence of sin. What is the essence of sin?

Didn't really define it. Did I? The essence of sin is us substituting ourselves for God. Putting ourselves into places where only God deserves to be in your own life. Well, then what's the essence of salvation?

And the answer is right here in verse 4, 5 and 6. It's God substituting himself for us. This is the meaning of life, substitution. Look, first of all, in verse 4, it says,  pardon me, verse 5, he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities.

Now, in Hebrew doesn't say 4. He just wouldn't work in English to put out exactly what it says in Hebrew. It says he was pierced from our transgressions. He was crushed from our iniquities. And that's the Hebrew way of saying he was crushed as a result of.

See, it's what it's actually that he was pierced as a result. Wait, wait, wait. Our transgression, consequence, goes to him. See, our iniquity, consequence, goes to him. And then, look down here, verse 11.

Whoops, sorry, look over here, verse 11. It says, by his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many. My righteous servant will justify many. You know what the word justification means? You think about it.

In English, it works. What if you make a statement, and I don't like it, or I'm upset by it,  or I don't, that's why I come to you, and I say,  you made a statement, justify that statement. And you say, well, let me explain, and you make some explanations. And I say, oh, fine. Okay, good.

You justified. That's fine. What did you just do? Did you change the statement? No.

You didn't change it a bit. You didn't change the word. You didn't change the letter. But what you did do, you changed my attitude toward it. You changed my relationship to it.

When it says that our transgressions have gone, have, have, have a cause,  and the cause of the transgressions have gone to him. It's also saying he is of the perfect life,  and the cause, the consequence of that perfect life, will come to us. Just as God, here, the essence of being a Christian. What's the essence of being a Christian? Trying hard to live like Jesus?

No, that's a consequence. In fact, in most of our cases, that's an accident. What's the essence? When Jesus, you know, a second Corinthians 521,  is absolutely summarizing all of Isaiah 53, here's how it goes. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

What does that mean? What does it mean to say Jesus Christ became sin? Does that mean he became sinful? No. Does that mean he became wicked and nasty and awful?

No. What does it mean? It means he was treated by God as if he'd done every bloody thing  the humanity had ever done. Well, then what does it mean to become righteous in him? I know what most of you think.

You say, I want to become a Christian. I'm going to have to clean up my act. Well, yes, you are, but that's not the essence. What makes you a Christian is that the moment you believe in him  and you say, Father, for Jesus' sake,  because of what he did in history, except me. That moment, according to this,  it means every God gives you credit for absolutely everything  that Jesus ever did.

One of the things that comes out in here,  and you say, how could that be? Let me show you. One of the things that comes out in here  is the voluntariness of Jesus' death. Well, the voluntariness of his death comes out when it says,  he took up our infirmities, very active word. He picked them off of us in a sense and put them on himself.

Or all these places where he opened not his mouth,  he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth. What is all that? He's voluntary. He voluntarily died. Well, you say plenty of people voluntarily died.

No, they haven't. Nobody voluntarily died by Jesus. Let me say, have there people who,  given their lives for others,  those people who committed suicide? No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

They voluntarily... No. What they did was they chose, when did I? They didn't choose to die. You can't choose to die.

You're going to die. They choose how to die. They didn't choose to die. Even when you say, I choose to die and you commit suicide,  you're still a victim of death. You haven't chosen to die.

You were going to die. You could never have stopped it. You could never have held it off. Jesus is the only person who ever died who wasn't a victim of death. Jesus is the only person who ever died voluntarily.

The only person who didn't have to die. Ever have to die. Jesus was beautiful and he voluntarily became ugly. Jesus was unlimited and he voluntarily became limited. Jesus was eternal and he voluntarily died.

It was an act of supreme authority. That's the reason why one guy says Jesus Christ alone. His death was like this. It's almost as if Jesus Christ took his body in one hand  and his soul in one hand and tore himself apart. He says, I lay my life down according to all my own accord.

Now what does that mean? Well, it means something for your heart and something for your understanding  and then we're going to end. Here's the thing it means for your heart. The heart. What held Jesus to the cross?

Think about it. What held Him to the cross? I mean, there's a lot of people who died for other people. Those that they can move you. Something deep in our soul tells us substitution is the meaning of life.

Whenever you get near it in a story, you know,  the movie version of the screenplay of the last of the Mohicans. Remember, the women are about to be killed and incomes, you know,  you know, Daniel Dei Lewis, LaLonga Caribbean, you know,  Nathaniel Poe, at least in the story. And he comes and he says to the... Mary says to the Indian chief, me for her. You see, me for them, me for them.

Kill me instead of them. But he doesn't know French. You see, and he doesn't... Or he doesn't know the language. So he has to do it through an interpreter.

Remember who the interpreter is? Duncan. Duncan, the spurned shooter of one of the women. And Duncan starts speaking, but Duncan says, me for them. And they string Duncan up, remember?

And they kill him? So they can flee. And you watch that? Something moves you. This is the meaning of life.

This is something amazing. Or, you know, tale of two cities. Charles Dickens fascinating place. Cecidney Carton is in love with the woman,  but she marries Charles Darnay. But Charles Darnay is soon in prison  and he's going to be executed.

He's going to go to the guillotine. And Cidney Carton, who looks quite a bit like Charles Darnay,  comes into see Charles Darnay and says, I'm switching with you. What? And he basically knocks the man out. And he puts on the cond...

You see, he puts on the condemned man's clothes. The condemned man is given the free man's clothes. And Cidney Carton dies. And by the way, near the very end, Cidney Carton,  who's playing like his Charles Darnay,  he's in line, he's ready to go to the guillotine,  and there's a woman, there's a young girl who's there,  and says, hey, you know me, I used to be with you back in here  and back in there, and she looks up,  and she realizes it's not Charles Darnay. And her face goes white.

And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yeah. And she says, hold my hand. Somebody like you, I think I'll be able to face anything  with somebody like you. And to see, what's going on there?

There's nothing more moving than that. It's the opposite of sin. And the opposite of sin is me first. Salvation is you first. The essence of sin is, see, your life for mine.

The essence of salvation is my life for yours. And when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross,  what was holding him there? His love for you, nothing else, nothing else at all. And that means, no matter what you do,  you couldn't possibly break his love for you. Think about it.

What did it take? It took God's wrath. It took punishment. It took all this stuff. And now, some days, you're sitting around and you're saying,  I've been so inconsistent.

I've been so stupid. I've been so foolish. I've done all this. I've done that. I wonder whether Jesus is going to give up on me.

Your inconsistency, your foolishness,  is going to break poor Jesus' little love  when this wouldn't break it? This love for you took everything  hell could give and it didn't give up. He was absolutely voluntary. He gave himself for you. That's something your heart's got to know.

It's a strong love. You couldn't possibly wear it out. You couldn't possibly wear it through it. But then, here's the last thing for your understanding. This is not only something you need to know  if you need to know this for your understanding.

Jesus Christ essentially fulfilled the law of God twice  when he came to earth because he didn't just die  to fulfill the law. He lived an incredible life. In that, he voluntarily gave himself for someone else. He actually did love his neighbor. You see, completely.

Another way to put it is this. I don't know how much it costs because I have made some of you know. There's the law of the stoplight in New York City. And there's two ways to satisfy the law of the stoplight. One is stop.

The other is pay $75, I think. Either way, you satisfy the law of the stoplight. How do you satisfy the law of God? Love your God with all your heart's whole strength  and love your neighbor as yourself? Or pay the penalty?

In Jesus Christ, as he was paying the penalty,  was loving God with all his heart's whole strength  and my and his neighbor as himself. So he fulfilled the law of God twice. You see, he took our sins. That leaves his record for us, his perfect record for us. Listen, put it this way.

What does this mean to you? It means the meaning of your life is the cross in two ways. Unless the cross makes sense to you, life won't make sense. Unless you begin to see, first of all, through the cross,  you're not going to have to worry anymore so much about your comfort  because the great disease has been taken away from you forever. You don't have to worry that much about your looks  because the great beauty has been put on you forever.

You don't have to worry that much about your reputation  because the only one who matters loves you. What does that mean? It means as you go out into the world,  this stuff that used to bother you just doesn't. Suffering will happen. You'll get sick, but the great disease you see has been cured.

You'll get abused, but you see, the great reputation is yours. And so what happens is that you move on through the cross  not only gives you an emotional well to handle the problems of life,  but then secondly, it gives you the wisdom to see,  look, this is the way Jesus came. This is the weakness of the arm of the Lord. So often, the best things that happen in life are because  of through weakness and suffering and trouble and difficulty. Until the cross is the joy of your life,  life won't make sense to you.

Until the cross makes sense, life won't make sense. And then, not only is it true that the cross will make sense  of your life, the cross then becomes the pattern for your life. Here's what's so wonderful. You feel so rich if you understand the cross  that you start to live like Jesus. You basically say, not your life or mine,  my life for you, you spend yourself.

You know what's interesting about this? Suffering and oppression, he is oppressed. He is the victim of injustice. He is cut off in the land of living. He's the recipient of a violent debt.

Most of us in this room are never going to experience any of that kind of injustice. Oh, what's so great about this is this. If you don't believe in God,  injustice and suffering is a horrible problem, you know why? It's a tremendous mystery. It's a mystery why you're upset.

Because you see, if there is no God,  then the strong eating of the weak is utterly natural, totally natural. And what why aren't you God for insisting it should be some other way? This is the way it is. So he says, suffering and injustice is a terrible problem if you don't believe in God. But if you do believe in God, then it becomes a terrible problem,  because why doesn't he stop it?

But of all the gods that we have  and all the different religions that are at least presented to us,  there's only one God who's been involved. So when any other God says, I've got good reasons, you know,  it sounds pretty hollow. But when you have a God who actually was the victim of injustice,  you better trust Him. And you better start living your life for other people who have been through the same thing. My life for yours.

This is the essence of being a Christian. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place. We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is,  and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now.

We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice,  not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims. A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives,  not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord.

And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you,  you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：根本问题

有些人说世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人说是糟糕的制度、教育不良或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

### 以西结的异象

我最近在读以西结书，以西结与流亡者在一起，他在一个遥远的地方，他的许多犹太同胞都在说我们如何能在异地敬拜上帝，他得到了这个异象？你读过它。它很奇怪，但以西结异象中最重要的是他看到上帝高高在上，他看到他们在他的宝座上，但以西结的异象与以赛亚的异象或其他任何人的上帝宝座异象有所不同。如果你看宝座的底部，他发现上帝的宝座有轮子。这是一个移动的上帝，这是上帝在说我可以给你一个家，我可以在任何地方居住，任何地方。所以欢迎回家。

### 主的仆人

让我为你读以赛亚书 52 章 13 节到 53 章的结尾，52:13 到 53:12，看我的仆人将行事智慧。他将被高举并极其尊崇，正如许多人对他感到震惊。他的外貌被毁坏，超过任何人，他的形象被毁坏，超出人类的样子。因此，他将洒在许多国家，君王因他闭口不言，因为他们未曾被告知的，他们将看到，他们未曾听闻的，他们将明白。

> "谁信了我们的信息，耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？"

**他在他面前长大如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。**

### 罪的本质

我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路，耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口。他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。

### 救赎的本质

但他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤，因他受的刑罚我们得平安，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。

### 十字架的意义

耶稣基督并不是本质上来。其他每一个创始人都来并说，耶稣没有。其他每一个宗教都来并说，我要告诉你如何与上帝连接。做这个。耶稣基督说，我要连接你与上帝。我已经做了这个，或者用另一种方式说，只是有多种方式来表达。它意味着，例如，福音是新闻，而不是建议。

### 结论：活出基督徒的生命

父啊，我们感谢你这伟大的概述。在某种程度上，这是一个开始服务的好方法，一个在新地方的敬拜社区。我们看到了福音的本质，罪的本质，救赎的本质，以及我们现在应该如何生活的本质。我们感谢你，我们有唯一一个曾是受害者而不是施害者的上帝。一个使我们如此富有以至于我们可以为其他受害者付出的上帝。一个变得软弱以便我们可以看到软弱就是力量的上帝。父啊，我们祈求你帮助我们理解这些事情，并将它们融入我们的生活中，不仅作为个人，而且作为这里的敬拜社区。我们感谢你，主。我们祈求在接下来的服务中，当我们向你祷告时，当我们将这些事情献给你时，你可能塑造我们并将我们的心更多地塑造成我们刚刚看到的形象。那位伟大的仆人，耶稣基督，公义者，奉他的名祷告。阿门。
