## English Transcript / 英文原文

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I was reading Ezekiel recently and Ezekiel got to, was with the exiles and he was in  a far off land and a lot of his, a lot of his fellow Jews were saying how can we worship  God in a strange land and he got this vision? You're read it. It's strange, but the most important thing about Ezekiel's vision is he sees God high  and lifted up and he sees them on his throne, but there's something different about Ezekiel's  vision than Isaiah's vision or anybody else's vision of the throne of God. If you look to the bottom of the throne, he found that God's throne had wheels.

It was a mobile God and it was a, it was God's way of saying I can make you a home that you  when I can dwell in absolutely anywhere, absolutely anywhere. So welcome home. And let me read to you Isaiah 52, 13 verses, from 13 down to the end of chapter 53, 52, 13  to 53, see my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled  at him. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man in his form, marred beyond human  likeness.

So will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what  they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand. Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoe and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we  should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering.

Like one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken  by God, smitten by him and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment  that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the Lord has  laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth.

He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers his silent,  so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for  he was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people, he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with a wicked and with a help and with the rich in his death  though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord  makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and  the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied.

By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with  the strong because he poured out his life on the death and was numbered with the transgressors  for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. This is God's word. There's a little bit of a guess that there's new people here tonight that haven't been part  of any series and this is actually part of a series and we've been actually talking  about what's wrong with us. I mean the human race.

Captain I just watched a video of a movie I think it came out last year was just called  Paradise Road, true story of a prison of war camp in Sumatra, World War II and all  of those true stories, whether it's the book Shanton Compound by Langdon Gilgi or the  accounts of the death cast by Victor Frankel or this movie, they're gripping of course  but there's a whole lot more than that. What happened in the Holocaust? What happened in World War II? What happened on the battlefield, what happened in the prison camp was this, the optimistic  views of human nature that were very very prevalent for about a hundred years before that in  the West. The optimistic views, the views that said basically evil is a matter of a bad family  nurturing or a lack of education or not the right socialization process or just false  consciousness.

All those kinds of optimistic approaches were devastated. They were devastated because when you're in the midst of one of those experiences, when  you're in the midst of, when they were in the midst of World War II, two questions keep  coming up. See, what's wrong with us that we're capable of this and what are we going to do about  it? What's wrong with us and how can we address it and what's interesting about this chapter,  it's very easy to forget who this was written to. There's a lot of disagreement among scholars about the book of Isaiah but one thing everybody's  in agreement about is Isaiah chapter 40 through 55 was written for a nation that was facing  exile was written to the Israelites who were about to face all the stuff we're talking  about, captivity, atrocities, prison.

And it was written to them to answer the same two questions, what's wrong with the human  race and what are we going to do about it and this is the answer, maybe the best answer,  maybe the most famous answer in the Bible to the question about human evil. Here's the answer, God sending somebody, the servant of the Lord and what we learn  in, we take a look at the text is we learn who he is, why he came and what he did, pretty  much everything, right? Who he is, why he came, what he did, let's take a look, first of all who he is. Now there's a little, there's a lot in this passage and when we get to the top, you see  it pretty straight off the bat, it says see my servant will act wisely, he'll be raised  and lifted up and highly exalted. Now actually that's the same terminology that describe the one that Isaiah saw in the  temple, back in Isaiah 6, when it says, I went to the temple and I saw the Lord high and  lifted up the same words, it's got to do with the transcendence, the transcendent majesty  of God, it's got to do with the purity, the perfection, it's amazing that the same terms  would be attached to this person, but the real amazing thing is verse 1, and you don't  notice it right off the bat and there's a number of ways to translate it, let me just  tell you what he's saying, verse 1, who has believed our message and to whom has the  arm of the Lord been revealed.

Now let me give you a little bit of a paraphrase of this, what he's saying is who has believed  our message, that this is the arm of the Lord, it's going to take revelation, Isaiah is  saying, nobody's going to believe that this one, this servant, is the arm of the Lord,  nobody's going to believe it, and here's why, the arm of the Lord is not just a kind of  nice metaphor that Isaiah came up with on the spot, the arm of the Lord is a specific,  has a very specific, very definite meaning in the Hebrew Bible and also especially in the  book of Isaiah. The arm of the Lord is the Lord himself come into history to do something concrete. The arm of the Lord is what moved the Red Sea, part of the Red Sea. See, the arm of the Lord is not God's strength in general, of course arm, if it was the eye  of the Lord we'd be talking about the knowledge of God, but the arm of the Lord is the power  of God, but not just any kind of power, it's not just general strength, it's God's power  in history. And no wonder Isaiah says, look, I know people aren't going to believe it, nobody's going  to believe that this is the arm of the Lord reveal, this is the arm of the Lord.

This person is the omnipotent God come into history. Now before we move on, we've got to move on, let me just say what's neat about this passage,  it's got to do with essentials. In fact, the more I look at this, who is why he came, you know, what he came to do. This really gets a kind of essential definition, this whole passage for example, you know, Aristotle  brought us the distinction between what he called the essence and the accidents, the essentials  and the accidentals. So for example, what if you've never seen clay, you've never seen steel before in your life?

And I put in front of you a ball of clay and a steel-eye beam and I said, okay, what's  the difference between clay and steel? And you looked and said, I got it, clay is round, steel is long. And you'd say, it's hard to laugh in here, isn't it, but try. Okay, you know, you can laugh under curly cues. You don't just need graffiti, okay, now, that's better.

You'd say, you've missed the essence, those are accidentals, it's sort of an accident. Clay can take numbers of shapes, but the shape is an essential, shape is not essential. It's the, you know, it's softness, hardness, chemical composition, all that kind of thing. Now, what's the essence of Christianity? Well, you say Christianity leads people to love one another.

Yeah, yeah, but hey, there's a lot of people who aren't Christians that are very loving. Well, Christianity leads you, it gives you strength, gives you peace, makes you good. Yeah, but those are accidental. I don't mean they're accidents. I'm using it in the Aristotelian terms, they're not, they're not the essential.

They're not, they overlap with lots of other groups of people. What's essential? The armeness of Christianity. What do I mean? All right, here's what I mean.

Jesus Christ is not here called the mouth of God, the mouth of the Lord. He's called the arm of the Lord. That doesn't mean he didn't come to teach. He's a teacher, but it didn't primarily come to tell you what to do. He came primarily to do.

And that's the essential difference between Christianity and every other religion. Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God. Do this.

Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it. It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice. You see, the other founders come with advice and they say, hey, here's how you can change your life. But news is this is what's happened that changes your life.

Now, if I, what? Some of you may have heard me say this before, but let me put it to another way that I think brings it home. The stories of Christianity don't work unless they're true. Whereas the stories of other religions work anyway. See, for example, what's the purpose of Buddhism?

What's Buddhism about? It's about enlightenment. It's a wonderful faith. It's got lots of great stuff to teach us, it's about enlightenment. And it's about an attitude toward life, an attitude toward suffering, an attitude toward not grasping and working against the craving ego.

So all the stories about Buddha, does it matter if they're true or not? No, it doesn't. Here's why. I mean, they might be, they may not be. The point is, they're inspiring and they're exemplary.

They tell me how to find enlightenment. They tell me how to live and they work with their true or not. Muhammad, in many no disrespect anybody, but take a look at the stories of Muhammad. What is Islam about? Well, the word Islam means submission, obedience, not so much enlightenment, obedience to Allah.

So all the stories about Muhammad work in this. Whether they're true or not, they show me how to submit, they show me what to do, right? So they work. Let's look at the stories of Christianity. Okay, let's look at the Christmas story, born in a manger.

Okay, what's the moral of that story? Have natural childbirth? What's the moral? Homelessness is fine. What's the moral?

Listen, there is no moral. The story is this, the arm of the Lord. The ideal has broken into history. It's become real. Finally, and this has happened and it's changes everything.

Well, in fact, let me, let's get more to the point. Let's take a look at the story in front of us, the cross. There's a Christian story. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Now, what's the moral of that story?

If that story's not true, think about this for a second. You say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's true. It's just, it's inspirational. Oh, really? Let's think about this for a minute.

What's the moral of the story? Don't protect yourself. You're the victim of what, is it say, oppression? When oppression comes to you, you just give in. You just let them walk all over you.

You don't open your mouth, you don't protest. Just let injustice roll over you, is that? Is that the moral of the story? That's perverse. You know, there's another way to put it, okay?

I put it to you like this. Let's just say you and I have gone to the top  of the Empire State Building. And we're looking out there and all of a sudden,  you come to me and say, Tim, I just want you to know  how much I love you. I want you to know how much I care for you  and I'm gonna show you how much I love you. And you get up on the ledge and you say, watch.

And you throw yourself off and down you go to your death. And I do I look over the ledge and I say,  look how that person loves me. How do I do I? No, I was, what's wrong with that person? But what if I, because I'm stupid  or because I'm a fool or something,  what if I get to the edge myself  and I'm about to fall off and you come over  and you push me to safety but in the process you fall?

Now listen, the crucifixion is something  has happened in history that changes everything. The servant has come to take your punishment,  changes everything. If it's not true, it's not just unimportant, it's bad. It's not just that the story doesn't work. If it's not true, it actually works badly.

It's a perverse, it's a, it's pernicious. Unless the story's a Christianity or true,  unless Jesus Christ is the arm and not just the mouth. See, Christianity is really bad for you. Very, very bad, terrible. It's one of the other, he is the arm of the Lord.

Okay, that's who came. It's God himself acting in history. Second, that's who he came and the wider he comes now. Again, we're getting into essence  because the reason he came and his look,  verses four through six, there's a whole sleut  of a great vocabulary where it's a whole survey  of almost every kind of way to describe human evil. Sin, look, you've got infirmities.

See, transgressions andiquities. By the way, some of you, of all the words,  by the way, that's almost my favorite one  because you know what? The Hebrew word translated iniquity, it's a shame. It doesn't come across in English at all. It means bent, bent, okay?

Bent means it doesn't work,  but if you try to unbend, it'll just make it worse. It'll break. But in the midst of all of these interesting words,  there's one that kind of gets at the essence  of what's wrong with us. So this is the answer to the question. What's wrong with us?

Here it is. Verse six, very famous, but overlooked. All we like sheep have gone astray,  each of us has turned to his own way. Now you say my word, this is the central place  where God is telling us the secrets  of what's wrong with us, of human evil. This is a definition of evil.

This is a definition of sin, own way. My word you say, I mean, you know,  why not murder or robbery or something like that? I mean, every little kid wants their own way. I'm glad you said that. Look, a friend of mine who's, he's a lifetime bachelor.

He's a preacher and I listen to his sermons. And but since he's a lifetime bachelor,  when he actually comes across children,  he's always struck by them in a way that I don't,  any more because I've, you know,  being a parent I'm sort of surrounded by them. One day he was at a retreat and he was walking  with a whole family of five and he were walking along  and they were on their way to a pony corral. And the parents were saying to Charles,  there was Charles and Sarah and Sally. And the parents said, now Charles,  you rode the pony all morning.

It's Sarah and Sally's turn. So it's their turn. And he said, oh, he nodded his head. They rounded a turn. They got near the corral.

And as soon as they got near the corral,  Charles dart off ahead of everybody, ran into the crowd,  ran up to the staff person who was in charge of it,  and said, me first. And my friend, you know, this profound,  what kind of illustration is this? But he was amazed by it. Yeah, I'm amazed. But then he suddenly thought about it.

He says, well, wait a minute. What if this is the unbelievable heart  of every microchip in the soul of every human being? Can never be put out? What if this is essential? Well, there's many, many, many accidental.

I mean, there's many forms of it. But what if this is something we can never delete? He says, if me first, basically, is what's wrong? What are death camps? What is war?

What is every single crime? What is every crime? Come on. What's the essence of every crime? Me first.

That's it. I mean, years ago, Burger King had a song. Remember, it had a little ditty. It said, have it your way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin.

Frank Sinatra sang, I did it my way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin. But now, look, it's not just very helpful. Very helpful showing us, basically, my way. Me first, how that shows what our relationships  with each other, but essentially,  it shows us our relationship with God.

Because it doesn't say we are all like snakes,  gone to our own way. Snakes know their way. Sheep need a shepherd. And when sheep want to go their own way,  what they're saying is, I want to be my own shepherd. And when a human being goes its own way,  what we're saying is, I want to be my own maker.

We're not totally sure whether Psalm 100 booted off  of Isaiah 53 or whether I Isaiah 53 boots off of Psalm 100. But I hear, listen, Psalm 100 says,  know that the Lord is God. It is He who has made us and not we ourselves  for where is people, the sheep of this pasture. Now, very simple, listen. This is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea  to think so much of sin in terms of breaking rules.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness,  wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world  and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. If you say sin is breaking rules, God's rules,  and that's partly, that's one perspective,  but if you start there, here's the problem. Let's just say you just cheated on the test. You get cheated on the test. Well, that's something like robbery.

So you think of sin and you can actually say,  well, it's just a very small sin. You just, you know, it seems so insignificant. And therefore, you're thinking of sin  sort of like a pile of ceramic pots. And they're all on the pile and you throw a baseball  into the pile and you break one. Whoops, you go on over, take it away.

Who's going to know the difference? I mean, the pile is intact, basically. But sin is much more like throwing a baseball through a window. Either the window is intact or it's shattered. And here's the point, either God is God in your life.

Either he calls the shots, you might say. Either you let him be God. It's another way to put it. Or else you're God in your life. And we put it three ways.

First of all, either your will is law and his will is advice. Or see, his will is law and your will is advice. Let me put it another way. If you say aloe bay, when it makes sense to me,  if it fits in with my opinion of what is good for me,  if it fits my feelings,  if you say aloe bay, if what you're saying is,  my will, my wisdom, my goals,  sit in judgment on God's. If you say aloe bay, no matter what,  aloe bay, if it kills me, aloe bay,  if I'm the last person on the earth that does,  aloe bay, no matter what it costs me,  aloe bay, whether I understand it or not,  aloe bay, whether it's practical or not,  aloe bay, whether it's relevant or not,  then and only then.

You're saying God's wisdom,  God's will and God's goals sit in judgment on mine. Now it's one of the other. There's no in between. It's not like you break a couple of rules,  but basically the piles intact. It's a principle of God's godness.

Who's the shepherd? Who's the sheep? Who's the Lord? Who's the servant? Who's will is law?

And who's will is advice? It's one of the other. There's nothing in the middle. Nothing at all. And this is what's so interesting.

It says, if you decide you're going to be  the call to shots in your own life,  this isn't so much,  hey, this is not so much, for example,  cheating on a test. This is essentially living for your own happiness,  living for your own comfort,  living for your own glory. Just making your decisions without reference to God,  just ignoring God is that you've broken the glass. You've bent your soul. Nothing's going to work.

If you read through here,  and I don't have time to do it,  your emotions won't work. It tells you that. Your intellect won't work. He was steamed him not. We thought he was zero.

That's literally what it means. Your emotions don't work. When you look at him,  you don't desire him. I mean, nothing will work. Now, one more before we go on to the last point.

That's why he came. He came because there's some undeleteable,  seemingly insignificant thing  on the external microchip of every human heart,  which is,  I want to be God. I want to be my own God. Me first,  which is the cause of all the misery. That's why he came.

But one little thing. Think about this for a second. Christians are often accused of  having their head in the sand intellectually,  and by the way,  it's true. However,  it's awfully easy,  more than easy. The average person  when it comes to their relationship with God  definitely has his or her head in the sand.

Here's why I want to put it. Here's how I want to put it. According to this. If God's your maker. If God made you.

If you've been created by God. You owe him everything. Absolutely everything. You owe it to have him be the one who calls all shots. Right?

Otherwise,  you're bent. Otherwise,  it's terrible. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's stupid.

You're going to die as certainly as those  shaped sheep that think they can be shepherds will die. So,  if, see,  if God made you,  then you have to go all the way with him. Totally is God being number one. If he did not make you,  then it's warranted for you to go your own way. If you haven't been created by anybody,  of course you belong to yourself.

But then your life's meaningless. And if you're not created, you're an accident. You came without purpose into the world. No matter what you do,  everything's going to rot. Everything's going to burn up.

You do make any difference. And if your origin isn't significant,  and your destiny isn't significant,  have the intellectual guts to admit your life isn't significant,  and this is all you've got. If you've been made,  you have to give everything to him. If you haven't given everything to him,  then your life is utterly meaningless. And that's it.

You're either bent or you're meaningless. It's one or the other. And almost nobody thinks like that. Because almost nobody will say,  if everybody I know that says,  well, I have to decide what's right or wrong for me. They won't say, well, that means my life is utterly meaningless.

Or I am bending myself against the very God who made me. You don't do that. What do you say? Well, you just go along with what everybody else is saying. You're not thinking it out at all.

You're heads in the sand. Now, you're unconscious. Know something about it. It's something here. Am I still on?

Yeah. I think I kicked something, pardon me. You're unconscious. Your semi-conscious knows. It's why your Garcals at the sickness under death.

Sarger calls it nausea. Deep down inside, you know this. Either there's a God now. I'm absolutely everything. Or I don't.

I can be my own maker. And there's no meaning for anything. One or the other. Well, almost nobody thinks that out. You don't want to think it out.

But I'm respectfully asking you to think it out. Now, lastly. See? Who he is? Why he came?

What he did. Now, what we have here is one more essence. You know, the essence of who he is, Arm Noble Lord. The essence of sin. What is the essence of sin?

Didn't really define it. Did I? The essence of sin is us substituting ourselves for God. Putting ourselves into places where only God deserves to be in your own life. Well, then what's the essence of salvation?

And the answer is right here in verse 4, 5 and 6. It's God substituting himself for us. This is the meaning of life, substitution. Look, first of all, in verse 4, it says,  pardon me, verse 5, he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities.

Now, in Hebrew doesn't say 4. He just wouldn't work in English to put out exactly what it says in Hebrew. It says he was pierced from our transgressions. He was crushed from our iniquities. And that's the Hebrew way of saying he was crushed as a result of.

See, it's what it's actually that he was pierced as a result. Wait, wait, wait. Our transgression, consequence, goes to him. See, our iniquity, consequence, goes to him. And then, look down here, verse 11.

Whoops, sorry, look over here, verse 11. It says, by his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many. My righteous servant will justify many. You know what the word justification means? You think about it.

In English, it works. What if you make a statement, and I don't like it, or I'm upset by it,  or I don't, that's why I come to you, and I say,  you made a statement, justify that statement. And you say, well, let me explain, and you make some explanations. And I say, oh, fine. Okay, good.

You justified. That's fine. What did you just do? Did you change the statement? No.

You didn't change it a bit. You didn't change the word. You didn't change the letter. But what you did do, you changed my attitude toward it. You changed my relationship to it.

When it says that our transgressions have gone, have, have, have a cause,  and the cause of the transgressions have gone to him. It's also saying he is of the perfect life,  and the cause, the consequence of that perfect life, will come to us. Just as God, here, the essence of being a Christian. What's the essence of being a Christian? Trying hard to live like Jesus?

No, that's a consequence. In fact, in most of our cases, that's an accident. What's the essence? When Jesus, you know, a second Corinthians 521,  is absolutely summarizing all of Isaiah 53, here's how it goes. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

What does that mean? What does it mean to say Jesus Christ became sin? Does that mean he became sinful? No. Does that mean he became wicked and nasty and awful?

No. What does it mean? It means he was treated by God as if he'd done every bloody thing  the humanity had ever done. Well, then what does it mean to become righteous in him? I know what most of you think.

You say, I want to become a Christian. I'm going to have to clean up my act. Well, yes, you are, but that's not the essence. What makes you a Christian is that the moment you believe in him  and you say, Father, for Jesus' sake,  because of what he did in history, except me. That moment, according to this,  it means every God gives you credit for absolutely everything  that Jesus ever did.

One of the things that comes out in here,  and you say, how could that be? Let me show you. One of the things that comes out in here  is the voluntariness of Jesus' death. Well, the voluntariness of his death comes out when it says,  he took up our infirmities, very active word. He picked them off of us in a sense and put them on himself.

Or all these places where he opened not his mouth,  he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth. What is all that? He's voluntary. He voluntarily died. Well, you say plenty of people voluntarily died.

No, they haven't. Nobody voluntarily died by Jesus. Let me say, have there people who,  given their lives for others,  those people who committed suicide? No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

They voluntarily... No. What they did was they chose, when did I? They didn't choose to die. You can't choose to die.

You're going to die. They choose how to die. They didn't choose to die. Even when you say, I choose to die and you commit suicide,  you're still a victim of death. You haven't chosen to die.

You were going to die. You could never have stopped it. You could never have held it off. Jesus is the only person who ever died who wasn't a victim of death. Jesus is the only person who ever died voluntarily.

The only person who didn't have to die. Ever have to die. Jesus was beautiful and he voluntarily became ugly. Jesus was unlimited and he voluntarily became limited. Jesus was eternal and he voluntarily died.

It was an act of supreme authority. That's the reason why one guy says Jesus Christ alone. His death was like this. It's almost as if Jesus Christ took his body in one hand  and his soul in one hand and tore himself apart. He says, I lay my life down according to all my own accord.

Now what does that mean? Well, it means something for your heart and something for your understanding  and then we're going to end. Here's the thing it means for your heart. The heart. What held Jesus to the cross?

Think about it. What held Him to the cross? I mean, there's a lot of people who died for other people. Those that they can move you. Something deep in our soul tells us substitution is the meaning of life.

Whenever you get near it in a story, you know,  the movie version of the screenplay of the last of the Mohicans. Remember, the women are about to be killed and incomes, you know,  you know, Daniel Dei Lewis, LaLonga Caribbean, you know,  Nathaniel Poe, at least in the story. And he comes and he says to the... Mary says to the Indian chief, me for her. You see, me for them, me for them.

Kill me instead of them. But he doesn't know French. You see, and he doesn't... Or he doesn't know the language. So he has to do it through an interpreter.

Remember who the interpreter is? Duncan. Duncan, the spurned shooter of one of the women. And Duncan starts speaking, but Duncan says, me for them. And they string Duncan up, remember?

And they kill him? So they can flee. And you watch that? Something moves you. This is the meaning of life.

This is something amazing. Or, you know, tale of two cities. Charles Dickens fascinating place. Cecidney Carton is in love with the woman,  but she marries Charles Darnay. But Charles Darnay is soon in prison  and he's going to be executed.

He's going to go to the guillotine. And Cidney Carton, who looks quite a bit like Charles Darnay,  comes into see Charles Darnay and says, I'm switching with you. What? And he basically knocks the man out. And he puts on the cond...

You see, he puts on the condemned man's clothes. The condemned man is given the free man's clothes. And Cidney Carton dies. And by the way, near the very end, Cidney Carton,  who's playing like his Charles Darnay,  he's in line, he's ready to go to the guillotine,  and there's a woman, there's a young girl who's there,  and says, hey, you know me, I used to be with you back in here  and back in there, and she looks up,  and she realizes it's not Charles Darnay. And her face goes white.

And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yeah. And she says, hold my hand. Somebody like you, I think I'll be able to face anything  with somebody like you. And to see, what's going on there?

There's nothing more moving than that. It's the opposite of sin. And the opposite of sin is me first. Salvation is you first. The essence of sin is, see, your life for mine.

The essence of salvation is my life for yours. And when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross,  what was holding him there? His love for you, nothing else, nothing else at all. And that means, no matter what you do,  you couldn't possibly break his love for you. Think about it.

What did it take? It took God's wrath. It took punishment. It took all this stuff. And now, some days, you're sitting around and you're saying,  I've been so inconsistent.

I've been so stupid. I've been so foolish. I've done all this. I've done that. I wonder whether Jesus is going to give up on me.

Your inconsistency, your foolishness,  is going to break poor Jesus' little love  when this wouldn't break it? This love for you took everything  hell could give and it didn't give up. He was absolutely voluntary. He gave himself for you. That's something your heart's got to know.

It's a strong love. You couldn't possibly wear it out. You couldn't possibly wear it through it. But then, here's the last thing for your understanding. This is not only something you need to know  if you need to know this for your understanding.

Jesus Christ essentially fulfilled the law of God twice  when he came to earth because he didn't just die  to fulfill the law. He lived an incredible life. In that, he voluntarily gave himself for someone else. He actually did love his neighbor. You see, completely.

Another way to put it is this. I don't know how much it costs because I have made some of you know. There's the law of the stoplight in New York City. And there's two ways to satisfy the law of the stoplight. One is stop.

The other is pay $75, I think. Either way, you satisfy the law of the stoplight. How do you satisfy the law of God? Love your God with all your heart's whole strength  and love your neighbor as yourself? Or pay the penalty?

In Jesus Christ, as he was paying the penalty,  was loving God with all his heart's whole strength  and my and his neighbor as himself. So he fulfilled the law of God twice. You see, he took our sins. That leaves his record for us, his perfect record for us. Listen, put it this way.

What does this mean to you? It means the meaning of your life is the cross in two ways. Unless the cross makes sense to you, life won't make sense. Unless you begin to see, first of all, through the cross,  you're not going to have to worry anymore so much about your comfort  because the great disease has been taken away from you forever. You don't have to worry that much about your looks  because the great beauty has been put on you forever.

You don't have to worry that much about your reputation  because the only one who matters loves you. What does that mean? It means as you go out into the world,  this stuff that used to bother you just doesn't. Suffering will happen. You'll get sick, but the great disease you see has been cured.

You'll get abused, but you see, the great reputation is yours. And so what happens is that you move on through the cross  not only gives you an emotional well to handle the problems of life,  but then secondly, it gives you the wisdom to see,  look, this is the way Jesus came. This is the weakness of the arm of the Lord. So often, the best things that happen in life are because  of through weakness and suffering and trouble and difficulty. Until the cross is the joy of your life,  life won't make sense to you.

Until the cross makes sense, life won't make sense. And then, not only is it true that the cross will make sense  of your life, the cross then becomes the pattern for your life. Here's what's so wonderful. You feel so rich if you understand the cross  that you start to live like Jesus. You basically say, not your life or mine,  my life for you, you spend yourself.

You know what's interesting about this? Suffering and oppression, he is oppressed. He is the victim of injustice. He is cut off in the land of living. He's the recipient of a violent debt.

Most of us in this room are never going to experience any of that kind of injustice. Oh, what's so great about this is this. If you don't believe in God,  injustice and suffering is a horrible problem, you know why? It's a tremendous mystery. It's a mystery why you're upset.

Because you see, if there is no God,  then the strong eating of the weak is utterly natural, totally natural. And what why aren't you God for insisting it should be some other way? This is the way it is. So he says, suffering and injustice is a terrible problem if you don't believe in God. But if you do believe in God, then it becomes a terrible problem,  because why doesn't he stop it?

But of all the gods that we have  and all the different religions that are at least presented to us,  there's only one God who's been involved. So when any other God says, I've got good reasons, you know,  it sounds pretty hollow. But when you have a God who actually was the victim of injustice,  you better trust Him. And you better start living your life for other people who have been through the same thing. My life for yours.

This is the essence of being a Christian. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place. We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is,  and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now.

We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice,  not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims. A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives,  not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord.

And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you,  you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today's teaching, Tim Keller looks at how the Bible's teaching on sin gives us a deeply  honest and yet incredibly hopeful view of the world. I was reading Ezekiel recently and Ezekiel got to, was with the exiles and he was in  a far off land and a lot of his, a lot of his fellow Jews were saying how can we worship  God in a strange land and he got this vision? You're read it. It's strange, but the most important thing about Ezekiel's vision is he sees God high  and lifted up and he sees them on his throne, but there's something different about Ezekiel's  vision than Isaiah's vision or anybody else's vision of the throne of God. If you look to the bottom of the throne, he found that God's throne had wheels.

It was a mobile God and it was a, it was God's way of saying I can make you a home that you  when I can dwell in absolutely anywhere, absolutely anywhere. So welcome home. And let me read to you Isaiah 52, 13 verses, from 13 down to the end of chapter 53, 52, 13  to 53, see my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled  at him. His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man in his form, marred beyond human  likeness.

So will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what  they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand. Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoe and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we  should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering.

Like one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not. Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken  by God, smitten by him and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment  that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, and the Lord has  laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth.

He was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers his silent,  so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for  he was cut off from the land of the living, for the transgression of my people, he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with a wicked and with a help and with the rich in his death  though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord  makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and  the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied.

By his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with  the strong because he poured out his life on the death and was numbered with the transgressors  for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors. This is God's word. There's a little bit of a guess that there's new people here tonight that haven't been part  of any series and this is actually part of a series and we've been actually talking  about what's wrong with us. I mean the human race.

Captain I just watched a video of a movie I think it came out last year was just called  Paradise Road, true story of a prison of war camp in Sumatra, World War II and all  of those true stories, whether it's the book Shanton Compound by Langdon Gilgi or the  accounts of the death cast by Victor Frankel or this movie, they're gripping of course  but there's a whole lot more than that. What happened in the Holocaust? What happened in World War II? What happened on the battlefield, what happened in the prison camp was this, the optimistic  views of human nature that were very very prevalent for about a hundred years before that in  the West. The optimistic views, the views that said basically evil is a matter of a bad family  nurturing or a lack of education or not the right socialization process or just false  consciousness.

All those kinds of optimistic approaches were devastated. They were devastated because when you're in the midst of one of those experiences, when  you're in the midst of, when they were in the midst of World War II, two questions keep  coming up. See, what's wrong with us that we're capable of this and what are we going to do about  it? What's wrong with us and how can we address it and what's interesting about this chapter,  it's very easy to forget who this was written to. There's a lot of disagreement among scholars about the book of Isaiah but one thing everybody's  in agreement about is Isaiah chapter 40 through 55 was written for a nation that was facing  exile was written to the Israelites who were about to face all the stuff we're talking  about, captivity, atrocities, prison.

And it was written to them to answer the same two questions, what's wrong with the human  race and what are we going to do about it and this is the answer, maybe the best answer,  maybe the most famous answer in the Bible to the question about human evil. Here's the answer, God sending somebody, the servant of the Lord and what we learn  in, we take a look at the text is we learn who he is, why he came and what he did, pretty  much everything, right? Who he is, why he came, what he did, let's take a look, first of all who he is. Now there's a little, there's a lot in this passage and when we get to the top, you see  it pretty straight off the bat, it says see my servant will act wisely, he'll be raised  and lifted up and highly exalted. Now actually that's the same terminology that describe the one that Isaiah saw in the  temple, back in Isaiah 6, when it says, I went to the temple and I saw the Lord high and  lifted up the same words, it's got to do with the transcendence, the transcendent majesty  of God, it's got to do with the purity, the perfection, it's amazing that the same terms  would be attached to this person, but the real amazing thing is verse 1, and you don't  notice it right off the bat and there's a number of ways to translate it, let me just  tell you what he's saying, verse 1, who has believed our message and to whom has the  arm of the Lord been revealed.

Now let me give you a little bit of a paraphrase of this, what he's saying is who has believed  our message, that this is the arm of the Lord, it's going to take revelation, Isaiah is  saying, nobody's going to believe that this one, this servant, is the arm of the Lord,  nobody's going to believe it, and here's why, the arm of the Lord is not just a kind of  nice metaphor that Isaiah came up with on the spot, the arm of the Lord is a specific,  has a very specific, very definite meaning in the Hebrew Bible and also especially in the  book of Isaiah. The arm of the Lord is the Lord himself come into history to do something concrete. The arm of the Lord is what moved the Red Sea, part of the Red Sea. See, the arm of the Lord is not God's strength in general, of course arm, if it was the eye  of the Lord we'd be talking about the knowledge of God, but the arm of the Lord is the power  of God, but not just any kind of power, it's not just general strength, it's God's power  in history. And no wonder Isaiah says, look, I know people aren't going to believe it, nobody's going  to believe that this is the arm of the Lord reveal, this is the arm of the Lord.

This person is the omnipotent God come into history. Now before we move on, we've got to move on, let me just say what's neat about this passage,  it's got to do with essentials. In fact, the more I look at this, who is why he came, you know, what he came to do. This really gets a kind of essential definition, this whole passage for example, you know, Aristotle  brought us the distinction between what he called the essence and the accidents, the essentials  and the accidentals. So for example, what if you've never seen clay, you've never seen steel before in your life?

And I put in front of you a ball of clay and a steel-eye beam and I said, okay, what's  the difference between clay and steel? And you looked and said, I got it, clay is round, steel is long. And you'd say, it's hard to laugh in here, isn't it, but try. Okay, you know, you can laugh under curly cues. You don't just need graffiti, okay, now, that's better.

You'd say, you've missed the essence, those are accidentals, it's sort of an accident. Clay can take numbers of shapes, but the shape is an essential, shape is not essential. It's the, you know, it's softness, hardness, chemical composition, all that kind of thing. Now, what's the essence of Christianity? Well, you say Christianity leads people to love one another.

Yeah, yeah, but hey, there's a lot of people who aren't Christians that are very loving. Well, Christianity leads you, it gives you strength, gives you peace, makes you good. Yeah, but those are accidental. I don't mean they're accidents. I'm using it in the Aristotelian terms, they're not, they're not the essential.

They're not, they overlap with lots of other groups of people. What's essential? The armeness of Christianity. What do I mean? All right, here's what I mean.

Jesus Christ is not here called the mouth of God, the mouth of the Lord. He's called the arm of the Lord. That doesn't mean he didn't come to teach. He's a teacher, but it didn't primarily come to tell you what to do. He came primarily to do.

And that's the essential difference between Christianity and every other religion. Jesus Christ did not essentially come. Every other founder comes and says, Jesus did not. Every other religion comes and says, I'm going to show you how to connect to God. Do this.

Jesus Christ says, I'm going to connect you to God. I've done this or put it in another way, just number of ways to put it. It means, for example, the gospel is news, not advice. You see, the other founders come with advice and they say, hey, here's how you can change your life. But news is this is what's happened that changes your life.

Now, if I, what? Some of you may have heard me say this before, but let me put it to another way that I think brings it home. The stories of Christianity don't work unless they're true. Whereas the stories of other religions work anyway. See, for example, what's the purpose of Buddhism?

What's Buddhism about? It's about enlightenment. It's a wonderful faith. It's got lots of great stuff to teach us, it's about enlightenment. And it's about an attitude toward life, an attitude toward suffering, an attitude toward not grasping and working against the craving ego.

So all the stories about Buddha, does it matter if they're true or not? No, it doesn't. Here's why. I mean, they might be, they may not be. The point is, they're inspiring and they're exemplary.

They tell me how to find enlightenment. They tell me how to live and they work with their true or not. Muhammad, in many no disrespect anybody, but take a look at the stories of Muhammad. What is Islam about? Well, the word Islam means submission, obedience, not so much enlightenment, obedience to Allah.

So all the stories about Muhammad work in this. Whether they're true or not, they show me how to submit, they show me what to do, right? So they work. Let's look at the stories of Christianity. Okay, let's look at the Christmas story, born in a manger.

Okay, what's the moral of that story? Have natural childbirth? What's the moral? Homelessness is fine. What's the moral?

Listen, there is no moral. The story is this, the arm of the Lord. The ideal has broken into history. It's become real. Finally, and this has happened and it's changes everything.

Well, in fact, let me, let's get more to the point. Let's take a look at the story in front of us, the cross. There's a Christian story. Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Now, what's the moral of that story?

If that story's not true, think about this for a second. You say, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's true. It's just, it's inspirational. Oh, really? Let's think about this for a minute.

What's the moral of the story? Don't protect yourself. You're the victim of what, is it say, oppression? When oppression comes to you, you just give in. You just let them walk all over you.

You don't open your mouth, you don't protest. Just let injustice roll over you, is that? Is that the moral of the story? That's perverse. You know, there's another way to put it, okay?

I put it to you like this. Let's just say you and I have gone to the top  of the Empire State Building. And we're looking out there and all of a sudden,  you come to me and say, Tim, I just want you to know  how much I love you. I want you to know how much I care for you  and I'm gonna show you how much I love you. And you get up on the ledge and you say, watch.

And you throw yourself off and down you go to your death. And I do I look over the ledge and I say,  look how that person loves me. How do I do I? No, I was, what's wrong with that person? But what if I, because I'm stupid  or because I'm a fool or something,  what if I get to the edge myself  and I'm about to fall off and you come over  and you push me to safety but in the process you fall?

Now listen, the crucifixion is something  has happened in history that changes everything. The servant has come to take your punishment,  changes everything. If it's not true, it's not just unimportant, it's bad. It's not just that the story doesn't work. If it's not true, it actually works badly.

It's a perverse, it's a, it's pernicious. Unless the story's a Christianity or true,  unless Jesus Christ is the arm and not just the mouth. See, Christianity is really bad for you. Very, very bad, terrible. It's one of the other, he is the arm of the Lord.

Okay, that's who came. It's God himself acting in history. Second, that's who he came and the wider he comes now. Again, we're getting into essence  because the reason he came and his look,  verses four through six, there's a whole sleut  of a great vocabulary where it's a whole survey  of almost every kind of way to describe human evil. Sin, look, you've got infirmities.

See, transgressions andiquities. By the way, some of you, of all the words,  by the way, that's almost my favorite one  because you know what? The Hebrew word translated iniquity, it's a shame. It doesn't come across in English at all. It means bent, bent, okay?

Bent means it doesn't work,  but if you try to unbend, it'll just make it worse. It'll break. But in the midst of all of these interesting words,  there's one that kind of gets at the essence  of what's wrong with us. So this is the answer to the question. What's wrong with us?

Here it is. Verse six, very famous, but overlooked. All we like sheep have gone astray,  each of us has turned to his own way. Now you say my word, this is the central place  where God is telling us the secrets  of what's wrong with us, of human evil. This is a definition of evil.

This is a definition of sin, own way. My word you say, I mean, you know,  why not murder or robbery or something like that? I mean, every little kid wants their own way. I'm glad you said that. Look, a friend of mine who's, he's a lifetime bachelor.

He's a preacher and I listen to his sermons. And but since he's a lifetime bachelor,  when he actually comes across children,  he's always struck by them in a way that I don't,  any more because I've, you know,  being a parent I'm sort of surrounded by them. One day he was at a retreat and he was walking  with a whole family of five and he were walking along  and they were on their way to a pony corral. And the parents were saying to Charles,  there was Charles and Sarah and Sally. And the parents said, now Charles,  you rode the pony all morning.

It's Sarah and Sally's turn. So it's their turn. And he said, oh, he nodded his head. They rounded a turn. They got near the corral.

And as soon as they got near the corral,  Charles dart off ahead of everybody, ran into the crowd,  ran up to the staff person who was in charge of it,  and said, me first. And my friend, you know, this profound,  what kind of illustration is this? But he was amazed by it. Yeah, I'm amazed. But then he suddenly thought about it.

He says, well, wait a minute. What if this is the unbelievable heart  of every microchip in the soul of every human being? Can never be put out? What if this is essential? Well, there's many, many, many accidental.

I mean, there's many forms of it. But what if this is something we can never delete? He says, if me first, basically, is what's wrong? What are death camps? What is war?

What is every single crime? What is every crime? Come on. What's the essence of every crime? Me first.

That's it. I mean, years ago, Burger King had a song. Remember, it had a little ditty. It said, have it your way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin.

Frank Sinatra sang, I did it my way. According to verse six, it's the essence of sin. But now, look, it's not just very helpful. Very helpful showing us, basically, my way. Me first, how that shows what our relationships  with each other, but essentially,  it shows us our relationship with God.

Because it doesn't say we are all like snakes,  gone to our own way. Snakes know their way. Sheep need a shepherd. And when sheep want to go their own way,  what they're saying is, I want to be my own shepherd. And when a human being goes its own way,  what we're saying is, I want to be my own maker.

We're not totally sure whether Psalm 100 booted off  of Isaiah 53 or whether I Isaiah 53 boots off of Psalm 100. But I hear, listen, Psalm 100 says,  know that the Lord is God. It is He who has made us and not we ourselves  for where is people, the sheep of this pasture. Now, very simple, listen. This is one of the reasons why it's not a good idea  to think so much of sin in terms of breaking rules.

Everywhere we look, we see brokenness,  wars, cruelty, and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it? In his brand new book that's releasing this month,  what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer.

Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer,  Dr. Keller shows how the reality of sin  explains the pain we see all around us  and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world,  struggling with your own mistakes or choices  or looking for hope and joy,  what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world  and the pain within each of us. This newly released book, What Is Wrong with the World  is our thanks for your gift this month  to help gospel and life share the good news of Jesus.

That's gospelandlife.com slash give. If you say sin is breaking rules, God's rules,  and that's partly, that's one perspective,  but if you start there, here's the problem. Let's just say you just cheated on the test. You get cheated on the test. Well, that's something like robbery.

So you think of sin and you can actually say,  well, it's just a very small sin. You just, you know, it seems so insignificant. And therefore, you're thinking of sin  sort of like a pile of ceramic pots. And they're all on the pile and you throw a baseball  into the pile and you break one. Whoops, you go on over, take it away.

Who's going to know the difference? I mean, the pile is intact, basically. But sin is much more like throwing a baseball through a window. Either the window is intact or it's shattered. And here's the point, either God is God in your life.

Either he calls the shots, you might say. Either you let him be God. It's another way to put it. Or else you're God in your life. And we put it three ways.

First of all, either your will is law and his will is advice. Or see, his will is law and your will is advice. Let me put it another way. If you say aloe bay, when it makes sense to me,  if it fits in with my opinion of what is good for me,  if it fits my feelings,  if you say aloe bay, if what you're saying is,  my will, my wisdom, my goals,  sit in judgment on God's. If you say aloe bay, no matter what,  aloe bay, if it kills me, aloe bay,  if I'm the last person on the earth that does,  aloe bay, no matter what it costs me,  aloe bay, whether I understand it or not,  aloe bay, whether it's practical or not,  aloe bay, whether it's relevant or not,  then and only then.

You're saying God's wisdom,  God's will and God's goals sit in judgment on mine. Now it's one of the other. There's no in between. It's not like you break a couple of rules,  but basically the piles intact. It's a principle of God's godness.

Who's the shepherd? Who's the sheep? Who's the Lord? Who's the servant? Who's will is law?

And who's will is advice? It's one of the other. There's nothing in the middle. Nothing at all. And this is what's so interesting.

It says, if you decide you're going to be  the call to shots in your own life,  this isn't so much,  hey, this is not so much, for example,  cheating on a test. This is essentially living for your own happiness,  living for your own comfort,  living for your own glory. Just making your decisions without reference to God,  just ignoring God is that you've broken the glass. You've bent your soul. Nothing's going to work.

If you read through here,  and I don't have time to do it,  your emotions won't work. It tells you that. Your intellect won't work. He was steamed him not. We thought he was zero.

That's literally what it means. Your emotions don't work. When you look at him,  you don't desire him. I mean, nothing will work. Now, one more before we go on to the last point.

That's why he came. He came because there's some undeleteable,  seemingly insignificant thing  on the external microchip of every human heart,  which is,  I want to be God. I want to be my own God. Me first,  which is the cause of all the misery. That's why he came.

But one little thing. Think about this for a second. Christians are often accused of  having their head in the sand intellectually,  and by the way,  it's true. However,  it's awfully easy,  more than easy. The average person  when it comes to their relationship with God  definitely has his or her head in the sand.

Here's why I want to put it. Here's how I want to put it. According to this. If God's your maker. If God made you.

If you've been created by God. You owe him everything. Absolutely everything. You owe it to have him be the one who calls all shots. Right?

Otherwise,  you're bent. Otherwise,  it's terrible. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's stupid.

You're going to die as certainly as those  shaped sheep that think they can be shepherds will die. So,  if, see,  if God made you,  then you have to go all the way with him. Totally is God being number one. If he did not make you,  then it's warranted for you to go your own way. If you haven't been created by anybody,  of course you belong to yourself.

But then your life's meaningless. And if you're not created, you're an accident. You came without purpose into the world. No matter what you do,  everything's going to rot. Everything's going to burn up.

You do make any difference. And if your origin isn't significant,  and your destiny isn't significant,  have the intellectual guts to admit your life isn't significant,  and this is all you've got. If you've been made,  you have to give everything to him. If you haven't given everything to him,  then your life is utterly meaningless. And that's it.

You're either bent or you're meaningless. It's one or the other. And almost nobody thinks like that. Because almost nobody will say,  if everybody I know that says,  well, I have to decide what's right or wrong for me. They won't say, well, that means my life is utterly meaningless.

Or I am bending myself against the very God who made me. You don't do that. What do you say? Well, you just go along with what everybody else is saying. You're not thinking it out at all.

You're heads in the sand. Now, you're unconscious. Know something about it. It's something here. Am I still on?

Yeah. I think I kicked something, pardon me. You're unconscious. Your semi-conscious knows. It's why your Garcals at the sickness under death.

Sarger calls it nausea. Deep down inside, you know this. Either there's a God now. I'm absolutely everything. Or I don't.

I can be my own maker. And there's no meaning for anything. One or the other. Well, almost nobody thinks that out. You don't want to think it out.

But I'm respectfully asking you to think it out. Now, lastly. See? Who he is? Why he came?

What he did. Now, what we have here is one more essence. You know, the essence of who he is, Arm Noble Lord. The essence of sin. What is the essence of sin?

Didn't really define it. Did I? The essence of sin is us substituting ourselves for God. Putting ourselves into places where only God deserves to be in your own life. Well, then what's the essence of salvation?

And the answer is right here in verse 4, 5 and 6. It's God substituting himself for us. This is the meaning of life, substitution. Look, first of all, in verse 4, it says,  pardon me, verse 5, he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities.

Now, in Hebrew doesn't say 4. He just wouldn't work in English to put out exactly what it says in Hebrew. It says he was pierced from our transgressions. He was crushed from our iniquities. And that's the Hebrew way of saying he was crushed as a result of.

See, it's what it's actually that he was pierced as a result. Wait, wait, wait. Our transgression, consequence, goes to him. See, our iniquity, consequence, goes to him. And then, look down here, verse 11.

Whoops, sorry, look over here, verse 11. It says, by his knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many. My righteous servant will justify many. You know what the word justification means? You think about it.

In English, it works. What if you make a statement, and I don't like it, or I'm upset by it,  or I don't, that's why I come to you, and I say,  you made a statement, justify that statement. And you say, well, let me explain, and you make some explanations. And I say, oh, fine. Okay, good.

You justified. That's fine. What did you just do? Did you change the statement? No.

You didn't change it a bit. You didn't change the word. You didn't change the letter. But what you did do, you changed my attitude toward it. You changed my relationship to it.

When it says that our transgressions have gone, have, have, have a cause,  and the cause of the transgressions have gone to him. It's also saying he is of the perfect life,  and the cause, the consequence of that perfect life, will come to us. Just as God, here, the essence of being a Christian. What's the essence of being a Christian? Trying hard to live like Jesus?

No, that's a consequence. In fact, in most of our cases, that's an accident. What's the essence? When Jesus, you know, a second Corinthians 521,  is absolutely summarizing all of Isaiah 53, here's how it goes. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

What does that mean? What does it mean to say Jesus Christ became sin? Does that mean he became sinful? No. Does that mean he became wicked and nasty and awful?

No. What does it mean? It means he was treated by God as if he'd done every bloody thing  the humanity had ever done. Well, then what does it mean to become righteous in him? I know what most of you think.

You say, I want to become a Christian. I'm going to have to clean up my act. Well, yes, you are, but that's not the essence. What makes you a Christian is that the moment you believe in him  and you say, Father, for Jesus' sake,  because of what he did in history, except me. That moment, according to this,  it means every God gives you credit for absolutely everything  that Jesus ever did.

One of the things that comes out in here,  and you say, how could that be? Let me show you. One of the things that comes out in here  is the voluntariness of Jesus' death. Well, the voluntariness of his death comes out when it says,  he took up our infirmities, very active word. He picked them off of us in a sense and put them on himself.

Or all these places where he opened not his mouth,  he opened not his mouth, he opened not his mouth. What is all that? He's voluntary. He voluntarily died. Well, you say plenty of people voluntarily died.

No, they haven't. Nobody voluntarily died by Jesus. Let me say, have there people who,  given their lives for others,  those people who committed suicide? No, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

They voluntarily... No. What they did was they chose, when did I? They didn't choose to die. You can't choose to die.

You're going to die. They choose how to die. They didn't choose to die. Even when you say, I choose to die and you commit suicide,  you're still a victim of death. You haven't chosen to die.

You were going to die. You could never have stopped it. You could never have held it off. Jesus is the only person who ever died who wasn't a victim of death. Jesus is the only person who ever died voluntarily.

The only person who didn't have to die. Ever have to die. Jesus was beautiful and he voluntarily became ugly. Jesus was unlimited and he voluntarily became limited. Jesus was eternal and he voluntarily died.

It was an act of supreme authority. That's the reason why one guy says Jesus Christ alone. His death was like this. It's almost as if Jesus Christ took his body in one hand  and his soul in one hand and tore himself apart. He says, I lay my life down according to all my own accord.

Now what does that mean? Well, it means something for your heart and something for your understanding  and then we're going to end. Here's the thing it means for your heart. The heart. What held Jesus to the cross?

Think about it. What held Him to the cross? I mean, there's a lot of people who died for other people. Those that they can move you. Something deep in our soul tells us substitution is the meaning of life.

Whenever you get near it in a story, you know,  the movie version of the screenplay of the last of the Mohicans. Remember, the women are about to be killed and incomes, you know,  you know, Daniel Dei Lewis, LaLonga Caribbean, you know,  Nathaniel Poe, at least in the story. And he comes and he says to the... Mary says to the Indian chief, me for her. You see, me for them, me for them.

Kill me instead of them. But he doesn't know French. You see, and he doesn't... Or he doesn't know the language. So he has to do it through an interpreter.

Remember who the interpreter is? Duncan. Duncan, the spurned shooter of one of the women. And Duncan starts speaking, but Duncan says, me for them. And they string Duncan up, remember?

And they kill him? So they can flee. And you watch that? Something moves you. This is the meaning of life.

This is something amazing. Or, you know, tale of two cities. Charles Dickens fascinating place. Cecidney Carton is in love with the woman,  but she marries Charles Darnay. But Charles Darnay is soon in prison  and he's going to be executed.

He's going to go to the guillotine. And Cidney Carton, who looks quite a bit like Charles Darnay,  comes into see Charles Darnay and says, I'm switching with you. What? And he basically knocks the man out. And he puts on the cond...

You see, he puts on the condemned man's clothes. The condemned man is given the free man's clothes. And Cidney Carton dies. And by the way, near the very end, Cidney Carton,  who's playing like his Charles Darnay,  he's in line, he's ready to go to the guillotine,  and there's a woman, there's a young girl who's there,  and says, hey, you know me, I used to be with you back in here  and back in there, and she looks up,  and she realizes it's not Charles Darnay. And her face goes white.

And she says, are you dying for him? And he says, yeah. And she says, hold my hand. Somebody like you, I think I'll be able to face anything  with somebody like you. And to see, what's going on there?

There's nothing more moving than that. It's the opposite of sin. And the opposite of sin is me first. Salvation is you first. The essence of sin is, see, your life for mine.

The essence of salvation is my life for yours. And when Jesus Christ was dying on the cross,  what was holding him there? His love for you, nothing else, nothing else at all. And that means, no matter what you do,  you couldn't possibly break his love for you. Think about it.

What did it take? It took God's wrath. It took punishment. It took all this stuff. And now, some days, you're sitting around and you're saying,  I've been so inconsistent.

I've been so stupid. I've been so foolish. I've done all this. I've done that. I wonder whether Jesus is going to give up on me.

Your inconsistency, your foolishness,  is going to break poor Jesus' little love  when this wouldn't break it? This love for you took everything  hell could give and it didn't give up. He was absolutely voluntary. He gave himself for you. That's something your heart's got to know.

It's a strong love. You couldn't possibly wear it out. You couldn't possibly wear it through it. But then, here's the last thing for your understanding. This is not only something you need to know  if you need to know this for your understanding.

Jesus Christ essentially fulfilled the law of God twice  when he came to earth because he didn't just die  to fulfill the law. He lived an incredible life. In that, he voluntarily gave himself for someone else. He actually did love his neighbor. You see, completely.

Another way to put it is this. I don't know how much it costs because I have made some of you know. There's the law of the stoplight in New York City. And there's two ways to satisfy the law of the stoplight. One is stop.

The other is pay $75, I think. Either way, you satisfy the law of the stoplight. How do you satisfy the law of God? Love your God with all your heart's whole strength  and love your neighbor as yourself? Or pay the penalty?

In Jesus Christ, as he was paying the penalty,  was loving God with all his heart's whole strength  and my and his neighbor as himself. So he fulfilled the law of God twice. You see, he took our sins. That leaves his record for us, his perfect record for us. Listen, put it this way.

What does this mean to you? It means the meaning of your life is the cross in two ways. Unless the cross makes sense to you, life won't make sense. Unless you begin to see, first of all, through the cross,  you're not going to have to worry anymore so much about your comfort  because the great disease has been taken away from you forever. You don't have to worry that much about your looks  because the great beauty has been put on you forever.

You don't have to worry that much about your reputation  because the only one who matters loves you. What does that mean? It means as you go out into the world,  this stuff that used to bother you just doesn't. Suffering will happen. You'll get sick, but the great disease you see has been cured.

You'll get abused, but you see, the great reputation is yours. And so what happens is that you move on through the cross  not only gives you an emotional well to handle the problems of life,  but then secondly, it gives you the wisdom to see,  look, this is the way Jesus came. This is the weakness of the arm of the Lord. So often, the best things that happen in life are because  of through weakness and suffering and trouble and difficulty. Until the cross is the joy of your life,  life won't make sense to you.

Until the cross makes sense, life won't make sense. And then, not only is it true that the cross will make sense  of your life, the cross then becomes the pattern for your life. Here's what's so wonderful. You feel so rich if you understand the cross  that you start to live like Jesus. You basically say, not your life or mine,  my life for you, you spend yourself.

You know what's interesting about this? Suffering and oppression, he is oppressed. He is the victim of injustice. He is cut off in the land of living. He's the recipient of a violent debt.

Most of us in this room are never going to experience any of that kind of injustice. Oh, what's so great about this is this. If you don't believe in God,  injustice and suffering is a horrible problem, you know why? It's a tremendous mystery. It's a mystery why you're upset.

Because you see, if there is no God,  then the strong eating of the weak is utterly natural, totally natural. And what why aren't you God for insisting it should be some other way? This is the way it is. So he says, suffering and injustice is a terrible problem if you don't believe in God. But if you do believe in God, then it becomes a terrible problem,  because why doesn't he stop it?

But of all the gods that we have  and all the different religions that are at least presented to us,  there's only one God who's been involved. So when any other God says, I've got good reasons, you know,  it sounds pretty hollow. But when you have a God who actually was the victim of injustice,  you better trust Him. And you better start living your life for other people who have been through the same thing. My life for yours.

This is the essence of being a Christian. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for this great survey. In some ways, it's a great way to start a service, a community worshiping community in a new place. We see the essence of what the gospel is, the essence of what sin is,  and the essence of salvation and the essence of how we are to live now.

We thank you that we have the only God who was the victim of injustice,  not the perpetrator. A God who then makes a so rich that we can spend ourselves for other victims. A God who has become weak so that we can see the way in which weakness is strength. Father, we pray that you would help us to understand these things and work them into our lives,  not just as individuals, but as a worshiping community here in this place. We thank you, Lord.

And we ask that during the rest of the services we pray to you, as we offer these things to you,  you might shape us and mold our hearts more in the image of what we have just seen. That of the great servant, Jesus Christ, the righteous one, in His name we pray. Amen.

### 中文翻译

### 引言：根本问题

有些人说世界的根本问题是贫穷。其他人说是糟糕的制度、教育不良或生物学，但如果这些都不能完全解释我们在头条新闻和自己内心中看到的破碎呢？在今天的教导中，Tim Keller 看圣经对罪的教导如何给我们一个深刻诚实但又极其充满希望的世界观。

### 以西结的异象

我最近在读以西结书，以西结与流亡者在一起，他在一个遥远的地方，他的许多犹太同胞都在说我们如何能在异地敬拜上帝，他得到了这个异象？你读过它。它很奇怪，但以西结异象中最重要的是他看到上帝高高在上，他看到他们在他的宝座上，但以西结的异象与以赛亚的异象或其他任何人的上帝宝座异象有所不同。如果你看宝座的底部，他发现上帝的宝座有轮子。这是一个移动的上帝，这是上帝在说我可以给你一个家，我可以在任何地方居住，任何地方。所以欢迎回家。

### 主的仆人

让我为你读以赛亚书 52 章 13 节到 53 章的结尾，52:13 到 53:12，看我的仆人将行事智慧。他将被高举并极其尊崇，正如许多人对他感到震惊。他的外貌被毁坏，超过任何人，他的形象被毁坏，超出人类的样子。因此，他将洒在许多国家，君王因他闭口不言，因为他们未曾被告知的，他们将看到，他们未曾听闻的，他们将明白。

> "谁信了我们的信息，耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？"

**他在他面前长大如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。**

### 罪的本质

我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路，耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口。他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。

### 救赎的本质

但他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤，因他受的刑罚我们得平安，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。

### 十字架的意义

耶稣基督并不是本质上来。其他每一个创始人都来并说，耶稣没有。其他每一个宗教都来并说，我要告诉你如何与上帝连接。做这个。耶稣基督说，我要连接你与上帝。我已经做了这个，或者用另一种方式说，只是有多种方式来表达。它意味着，例如，福音是新闻，而不是建议。

### 结论：活出基督徒的生命

父啊，我们感谢你这伟大的概述。在某种程度上，这是一个开始服务的好方法，一个在新地方的敬拜社区。我们看到了福音的本质，罪的本质，救赎的本质，以及我们现在应该如何生活的本质。我们感谢你，我们有唯一一个曾是受害者而不是施害者的上帝。一个使我们如此富有以至于我们可以为其他受害者付出的上帝。一个变得软弱以便我们可以看到软弱就是力量的上帝。父啊，我们祈求你帮助我们理解这些事情，并将它们融入我们的生活中，不仅作为个人，而且作为这里的敬拜社区。我们感谢你，主。我们祈求在接下来的服务中，当我们向你祷告时，当我们将这些事情献给你时，你可能塑造我们并将我们的心更多地塑造成我们刚刚看到的形象。那位伟大的仆人，耶稣基督，公义者，奉他的名祷告。阿门。

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

在今天的教导里，提姆·凯勒要谈的是：圣经关于罪的教导，怎样既让我们对这世界有一个极其诚实、又极其有盼望的看法。我最近在读以西结书。以西结和被掳的人在一起，他们在一个遥远的地方，他的许多同胞都在说：我们怎么能在异乡敬拜上帝呢？就在那时，他得了一个异象。你们读过，那的确很怪异。但以西结的异象里最重要的一点，是他看见上帝高高在上，坐在宝座上。不过，以西结所见的宝座，跟以赛亚或其他任何人所见的上帝宝座有一个不同之处：如果你看到宝座的底部，你会发现上帝的宝座有轮子。

那是一个会动的上帝。那是上帝在说：我可以在任何地方、绝对任何地方，为你们造一个可以居住的家、一个我可以居住的地方。所以，欢迎回家。让我为你们读以赛亚书第52章13节开始，一直到第53章末尾，52章13节到53章：“看哪，我的仆人行事必有智慧，必被高举上升，且成为至高。许多人因为他惊奇，他的面貌比别人憔悴，他的形容比世人枯槁。”

“这样，他必洗净许多国民，君王要向他闭口。”因所未曾传与他们的，他们必看见；未曾听见的，他们要明白。“我们所传的有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？他在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。他被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患。”

“他像被人掩面不看的一样，被藐视，我们也不尊重他。他诚然担当我们的忧患，背负我们的痛苦，我们却以为他受责罚，被神击打苦待了。那知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。因他受的刑罚我们得平安；因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路；耶和华使我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。他被欺压，在受苦的时候却不开口。”

“他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人手下无声，他也是这样不开口。他从受欺压和审判中被夺去。至于他同世的人，谁想他受鞭打，从活人之地被剪除，是因我百姓的罪过呢？他虽然未行强暴，口中也没有诡诈，人还使他与恶人同埋。”死的时候与财主同墓。“耶和华却定意将他压伤，使他受痛苦。耶和华以他为赎罪祭，他必看见后裔，并且延长年日，耶和华所喜悦的事必在他手中亨通。他必看见自己劳苦的功效，便心满意足。”

“有许多人因认识我的义仆得称为义，他要担当他们的罪孽。所以，我要使他与位高的同分，与强盛的均分掳物。因为他将命倾倒，以致于死，他也被列在罪犯之中。他却担当多人的罪，又为罪犯代求。”这是上帝的话。

我可以稍微猜一下，今晚这里有一些新朋友，你们之前并没有参加这个系列讲道。而这其实是一个系列的一部分，我们一直在谈一件事：我们到底出了什么问题？我是说整个人类。

前阵子我刚看了一部电影的录像，应该是去年出的，叫《通往天堂之路》（Paradise Road），讲的是发生在二战时期苏门答腊一个战俘营里的真实故事。所有这类真实故事——不管是兰登·吉尔基写的《尚顿营地》（Shantung Compound），还是维克多·弗兰克尔记述死亡集中营的作品，或是这部电影——当然都非常扣人心弦，但还不止于此。大屠杀究竟发生了什么？二战发生了什么？战场上发生了什么？集中营里发生了什么？发生的一切，把战前一百多年间在西方世界非常盛行的那种“乐观的人性观”全都击碎了。

那种乐观的看法、那种说“邪恶不过是家庭教养不好，或者是缺乏教育，或者是社会化过程不正确，或者只是错误的意识形态”的观点——这一切都被击毁了，都被摧毁了。因为当你身处那样的境况，当他们身处二战当中的时候，有两个问题反复浮现：我们到底出了什么问题，竟然能做得出这种事？那我们又要如何应对？我们出了什么问题？我们要怎么处理？

而有趣的是，在这章经文里，我们很容易忘记这段话最初是对谁说的。关于以赛亚书，学者们有许多分歧，但有一点大家都同意：第40到55章是写给一个即将被掳的民族的，是写给那些将要面对我们刚才提到的一切——被掳、暴行、囚禁——的以色列人。

这段经文写给他们，就是为了解答同样的两个问题：人类到底出了什么问题？我们该怎么办？而这里给出的答案，也许是圣经中对“人类邪恶”问题最好的解答，或者说是最有名的一处答案。答案是什么呢？上帝要差遣一位人来——“耶和华的仆人”。当我们来看这段经文时，我们就会看到：我们知道他是谁、知道他为什么来、知道他做了什么——基本上就是一切，对吧？他是谁，他为何而来，他做了什么。我们一一来看。先看第一点：他是谁。

在这段经文里内容非常丰富，但是一开始，在最上面，你就会很快看见这一点：经文说，“看哪，我的仆人行事必有智慧，他必被高举上升，且成为至高。”其实这句话和以赛亚在殿里所见的那一位所用的描述是一样的——回到以赛亚书第六章，他说：“我看见主坐在高高的宝座上……”这里“高高在上”的用词，就是同一个词。这指向什么？指向上帝那超然的威严，指向他的圣洁、完美。令人惊讶的是，这里用的竟然是同一组词，来描述这位“仆人”。

不过，真正令人惊奇的是第一节——你一开始不一定注意得到，而且原文有几种翻译方式。我就直接告诉你他在说什么：第一节，“我们所传的有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？”如果我稍微意译一下，其实是在说：谁会相信这个信息呢——谁会相信这就是耶和华的膀臂？要人相信这一点，得靠启示。以赛亚在说：没有人会相信这位仆人就是耶和华的膀臂；没有人会相信。

为什么？“耶和华的膀臂”不是以赛亚现场随手想出来的一个漂亮比喻，它在希伯来圣经中，尤其是在以赛亚书里，是一个非常明确、非常特定的用语。耶和华的膀臂，是指上帝亲自在历史中介入，做成某一件具体的事。是耶和华的膀臂使红海分开。明白吗？“耶和华的膀臂”不是宽泛意义上的“上帝的能力”。当然，从人体比喻来说，“膀臂”与能力有关；如果说“耶和华的眼目”，那是指上帝的知识。但“耶和华的膀臂”是上帝的能力，却不是抽象的能力，而是他在历史中的作为的能力。

难怪以赛亚会说：听着，我知道人不会信——没人会相信这位仆人就是耶和华膀臂的显现，就是耶和华的膀臂。这位“人”，就是全能的上帝亲自进入历史。

在继续往下之前——我们得继续往下——但先说一句：这段经文非常有意思，因为它在讲“本质的东西”。事实上，我越看，就越看到一个“本质定义”。整章经文——比如说，他是谁、他为什么来、他来要做什么——其实是在给我们一个关于基督信仰“本质”的定义。亚里士多德给我们带来了“本质”和“偶性”的区分，也就是“essential（本质）”和“accidental（偶然属性）”的区别。

举个例子：假设你从来没见过“黏土”和“钢铁”，我在你面前放一团黏土和一根钢铁工字梁，然后问你：好，现在说说黏土和钢铁的差别。你看了看说：我知道了——黏土是圆的，钢梁是长的。你大概会说——现在在这儿笑不太容易，但还是试试看——你会说：这就好像涂鸦区一样，你不一定要喷涂涂鸦，笑也行，好多了。

你会说：你抓错重点了。那只是一些“偶然属性”。黏土可以有很多形状，形状并不是本质；真正的本质，是它的柔软、坚硬程度、化学成分等等。那么，基督信仰的“本质”是什么？你可能会说：基督信仰让人彼此相爱——是的，但等等，很多不是基督徒的人也很有爱心啊。或者你会说：基督信仰给人力量、给人平安、让人变好——这些也都是“偶然属性”。我并不是说它们是“偶然发生的”，我是用亚里士多德的意思说，它们不是“本质”。它们和许多其他人群会重叠。

那什么才是“本质”？我称之为“基督信仰的那条手臂”。我是什么意思？注意，在这里，耶稣基督并不是被称为“耶和华的口”，而是“耶和华的膀臂”。这不表示他不是来教导的，他当然是教师。但他来的主要目的不是告诉你该做什么，而是来为你成就什么。

这就是基督信仰和其他一切宗教之间“本质上的不同”。每一位宗教创始人来到世上，基本上都是说：“我要告诉你如何与神建立联系——去做这些事。”而耶稣基督没有这么说。换一种表述方式：福音是“消息”，不是“建议”。你看，其他的创始人带着“建议”来，说：“这是你可以改变生命的方法。”但“消息”则是：“有件事已经发生了，它改变了你的生命。”

如果我……你们有些人之前可能听我说过，换一个方式再讲一次，或许更贴切。基督信仰的故事，如果不是真的，就完全行不通；而其他宗教的故事，即便不是真的，也一样可以“发挥作用”。举例来说，佛教的目的是什么？佛教在讲什么？是讲“觉悟”。这是个很美好的信仰，有很多很好的教导，是在讲“觉悟”，在讲一种对生命、对苦难、对“不执着”、对对抗贪恋自我的态度。

那么，关于佛陀的那些故事——它们是真是假重要吗？不重要。可能是真的，也可能不是。关键在于，这些故事具有启发性、具有模范性，它们告诉我如何追求“觉悟”、如何生活；不管真不真，这些故事都“有用”。再看穆罕默德——我无意冒犯任何人——但看看关于穆罕默德的那些故事。伊斯兰到底在讲什么？“伊斯兰”这个字本身就意为“顺服”、“降服”，不是那么强调“觉悟”，而是强调“顺服真主”。

所以关于穆罕默德的故事——无论真不真——都在向我展示如何顺服、展示我要做什么，对吧？因此它们“行得通”。现在来看看基督信仰的故事。好，我们看圣诞故事：耶稣降生在马槽里。这个故事的“寓意”是什么？自然生产要多推广？还是说：“无家可归也没关系”？这个故事到底给我们什么“道德教训”？其实没有任何所谓“寓意”。这个故事在讲的是：“耶和华的膀臂”——理想已经闯入历史，已经成了现实；终于，这件事已经发生了，它改变了一切。

再往前推一步，我们就看到眼前这段经文：十字架，这是一个基督信仰的故事。耶稣为我们的罪死在十字架上。这故事的“寓意”是什么？假如这故事不是真的，想一想。你会说：哦，这故事真不真不要紧，它只是“激励人心”罢了——真是如此吗？我们想一想，这故事的寓意是什么？难道是说：“不要保护自己”？你是受害者——那么，当压迫临到你，你就完全不反抗，你就让人践踏，你不张口、不抗议，只是任凭不公义碾压你——这是这个故事的寓意吗？这是病态的。

我再换种说法。假设你和我上到帝国大厦的顶层，我们站在那里往外看。突然你转向我说：“提姆，我只是想让你知道我有多爱你。我想让你知道我有多在乎你，我要向你展示我有多爱你。”然后你就爬上边缘说：“看好了。”接着你就跳下去，一路坠落至死。我走到边缘往下看，然后说：“哇，看他多爱我啊！”我会这样吗？不会。我会说：“这个人有啥问题？”

但如果情况不一样：假设因为我愚蠢，或者因为我失足，我自己站在边缘，快要掉下去了，你冲过来把我推向安全之处，可是因此你自己掉了下去。你看，十字架就是这样一个发生在历史中的事件，改变了一切：这位“仆人”来，承担了你的刑罚——这改变了一切。如果这不是真的，它就不仅仅是“无足轻重”，而且是有害的。这故事不只是“没用”，如果不是真的，它会起反作用，它是病态的、危险的。

除非基督信仰的故事是真的——除非耶稣基督真的是“上帝的膀臂”而不仅仅是“上帝的口”——否则基督信仰对你来说真的是很糟糕、非常糟糕、可怕至极。非此即彼。他就是耶和华的膀臂。

好了，这就是“他是谁”：他是上帝亲自在历史中行动。第二点：他为什么来？又是为何而来。这里同样触及“本质”，因为他来的原因——看第四到第六节——这里有一整串精彩的词汇，几乎涵盖了所有描述“人类邪恶”的方式。“罪”的各种讲法你都可以在这里找到。你看，有“忧患”、“过犯”、“罪孽”（译注：英文 infirmities, transgressions, iniquities）。顺便说一句，在所有这些词当中，我几乎最喜欢的是“罪孽”这个字，因为你知道吗？希伯来文中被译作“罪孽”（iniquity）的那个词，其实很可惜，在英文里完全体现不出来。它的字面意思是“弯曲”。弯曲意味着什么？意味着东西已经“坏了”；而且如果你硬想把它掰直，反而会弄得更糟——会折断。

不过，在这许多有意思的词当中，有一个词组相当精准地切中了我们出了什么问题的核心。这就是对“我们出了什么问题”的回答。第六节，非常著名，却也常常被忽略：“我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路。”你会说：我的天哪，这里是上帝在告诉我们，人到底出了什么问题、人的邪恶的秘密，这是对“罪”的定义吗？答案就是这句“小小的短语”——“己路”。你会说：我的天哪，这是上帝在这个最核心的地方给出的定义，可为什么不是“谋杀”、不是“抢劫”之类的大罪呢？每个小孩子都想要“自己的路”啊。

很好，我很高兴你这么说。我的一个朋友，他一辈子单身，是个传道人，我也常听他的讲道。因为他一直单身，所以每次他真的和孩子们待在一起时，都会以一种我已不再拥有的方式被震撼到——因为我自己做父母久了，身边总是孩子。有一次他在一个退修会里，和一个有五个孩子的全家一起散步。他们边走边聊，正往一个小马厩那边去。父母对其中一个孩子查尔斯说——那里有查尔斯、莎拉和莎莉——父母说：查尔斯，你早上已经骑过小马了，现在轮到莎拉和莎莉，这是她们的回合。他点点头。

他们转过一个弯，靠近马厩时，查尔斯突然冲到所有人前面，跑进马厩，跑到负责的小伙子面前，大喊一声：“我先！”我的朋友——你知道，他喜欢从这些事情里找“深刻的比喻”——他被惊到了，我也一样。可是他马上又想到：等等，如果“我先”正好是刻在每一个人心灵微芯片上的那个不可磨灭的核心怎么办？如果这是人真正的本质所在？它有成千上万种“外在形态”，但如果这是我们永远删不掉的一样东西呢？他说，如果“我先”就是人类出了问题的本质，那么死亡集中营是什么？战争是什么？每一宗罪案是什么？每一宗犯罪的本质是什么？“我先”。就是这样。

多年前，汉堡王有一个广告歌曲，你们还记得吗？有句歌词是“Have it your way”（“照你的方式来”）。按第六节的说法，这就是罪的本质。法兰克·辛纳屈唱“我行我素”（I did it my way），按第六节的说法，这也是罪的本质。不过，这段经文不仅极其有帮助地揭示了“我行我素”、“我先”怎样让我们在人际关系上出问题；从根本上，它更是在揭示：这暴露出了我们和上帝之间的关系。

因为经文没有说“我们都如蛇，各人偏行己路”。蛇知道自己的路。羊却需要牧人。当羊要走自己的路时，它实际上在说：“我要自己做牧人。”而当人要走自己的路时，他实际上在说：“我要做自己的创造主。”我们无法确定诗篇一百篇是照着以赛亚五十三章写的，还是以赛亚五十三章照着诗篇一百篇写的，但你能听到两处的呼应。诗篇一百篇说：“你们当晓得耶和华是神，我们是他造的，也是属他的；我们是他的民，也是他草场的羊。”

简单说，就是这样：这也是为什么，把罪主要理解为“违反规则”并不是一个好主意。当然，从某个角度看，“违背上帝的律法”是罪，这没有错；但如果你从这里起头，就会带来一个问题。比方说，你刚在考试里作弊了。你作弊，这和抢劫有点类似。你一想到罪，就会说：“哦，这不过是个小罪。我只是……好像也不是什么大不了的事。”然后你就把罪看成一堆陶器堆在那里，你丢一颗棒球进去，打碎了一只。哎呀，你走过去，把那只碎掉的拿走，谁会知道有什么不同呢？整堆陶器基本上还在。

但罪更像是什么？更像是把球丢进玻璃窗。如果玻璃窗完好无损就是完好无损，一旦被打碎就是彻底打碎。重点是：不是你打碎了几块玻璃，而是这扇窗要么是完好的，要么就是碎的。对应到我们的生命里，要么上帝是你生命中的上帝——你可以说，“他在你生命里说了算”；要么你自己是你的上帝。可以用三种方式来说：第一，要么你的意志是律法，他的旨意只是“建议”；要么他的旨意是律法，你的意志只是“建议”。

再换种说法：如果你说，“只要我觉得合理，只要符合我对什么对我有利的看法，只要符合我的感觉，我就顺服神”——如果你说，“我会顺服，只要……”——那你实际上就是在说：我的意志、我的智慧、我的目标对上帝的旨意有审判权。但如果你说：“无论如何都顺服——就算要我的命也顺服，就算全世界只剩我一个人顺服也顺服，无论代价多大、无论我能不能理解、无论实不实际、合不合潮流，我都顺服。”只有那时，你才是在说：上帝的智慧、上帝的旨意、上帝的目标对我的有审判权。

这是二选一。不是“我只是打破了几条规矩，但基本上整堆陶器还在”的问题，而是一个关于“上帝是不是上帝”的原则问题。谁是牧人？谁是羊？谁是主？谁是仆人？谁的意志是律法，谁的意志只是建议？这是非此即彼的，没有中间地带，一点都没有。这就是有趣之处：如果你选择让自己在生命中“说了算”，这不只是——比方说，不只是“考试作弊”这样的单一行为，而是从根本上“为自己的幸福而活、为自己的舒适而活、为自己的荣耀而活”，在做决定时完全不把上帝考虑在内，甚至干脆无视他——那么你就已经把那扇玻璃砸碎了，你把自己的灵魂掰弯了，一切都不会运作得好。

如果你通读这一章——我没时间细讲——你会看到：你的情绪不会正常运作。经文已经提到了。你的理智也不会正常运作。它说：“我们也不尊重他”，原文的意思是“我们认为他是零”。当你看见他时，你一点都不会被吸引。这意思是，你的情感不正常，你看见他也不觉得可爱、不觉得他有吸引力。没有一部分会正常运作。

在进入最后一点之前再说一句：这就是他来是为了什么。他来，是因为在人类的每一颗心的微芯片上，都有一个看上去微不足道却无法删除的东西——那就是“我要做神，我要做自己的神，我要先”。这就是一切苦难的根源。这是他来的原因。

不过，还有一点值得想一想。基督徒常常被指责说在思想上“把头埋在沙里”。顺带说一句，这是真的。然而，更容易、甚至可以说极其普遍地是：平均人在他和神的关系上，才是真正“把头埋在沙里”的那一个。我要这样说：如果上帝是你的创造主，如果真是上帝造了你，那么你就一切都欠他。你欠他一切、绝对的一切。你有责任让他成为那位说了算的那一位。否则，你就是“弯曲”的；否则，这就是极大的不公、不义、愚蠢。你一定会死，就像那些以为自己能做牧人的羊必定会死一样。

所以，如果上帝造了你，那么你就必须完全把一切都归给他，让他绝对居首位。如果他没有造你，那么你当然有理由走自己的路。如果你不是被谁造出来的，你当然属于你自己。不过，这样一来，你的生命就毫无意义。如果你不是被造的，那你就是一个意外。你来到世界没有任何目的，不管你做什么，一切最终都会腐烂、都会烧毁，你做的一切都不会留下任何真正的影响。如果你的起源毫无意义、你的归宿也毫无意义，那你就应该有足够的思想诚实，承认你的生命同样毫无意义——这就是全部。

你要么是“弯曲的”，要么是“毫无意义”，别无其他。可是几乎没有人这样思考。几乎没有人会说：“既然我身边的每一个人都说‘我要自己决定什么对我来说是对是错’，那这就意味着我的生命不是彻底毫无意义，就是我正在抵挡那位创造我的神。”你不会这样说。你会说什么？你只会顺着大众的话语往前走，不会把它想明白。

你没有把事情想透。你把头埋在沙里了。你在“无意识”或者“半意识”的层面里，其实是知道这件事的——这也是为什么克尔凯郭尔会把它称作《致死的疾病》，沙特会称之为“恶心”。在你内心深处，你是知道的：要么有一位上帝，他是你的一切；要么就没有，只有你自己做自己的创造主，而整个生命就此毫无意义。这是二选一。可是几乎没人愿意把这一点认真想透。你也不愿想。但我在这里，怀着尊重的态度，请你认真想一想。

最后一部分：他是谁？他为什么来？他做了什么？在这里，我们又看见一个“本质”。他是谁的本质——耶和华的膀臂；罪的本质——那么，罪的本质到底是什么呢？我还没真正给出定义。罪的本质，就是我们把自己放在只有上帝配得的位置上，在自己生命里坐上那个位置。那么，救恩的本质是什么？答案就在第四、五、六节：那就是上帝把自己摆在我们的位置上。换句话说，生命的意义就是“替代”。

先看第五节：“那知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤。”英文翻译成“for our transgressions（为我们的过犯）”，但希伯来文并不是用“for”这个介词。如果把原文直译过来，英文会很别扭。原文是：“他被刺，是因我们的过犯；他被压伤，是因我们的罪孽。”这其实是希伯来文表达“结果”的方式，也就是：我们的过犯——后果——落在他身上；我们的罪孽——后果——落在他身上。

再往下看第十一节：“因认识我的义仆，我的仆人使许多人称义。”（译注：和合本作“有许多人因认识我的义仆得称为义”。）你知道“称义”（justification）这个词是什么意思吗？从英文的用法也能看出来。如果你说了一句话，而我不认同或者不满意，我就来找你说：“你刚才说的那句话，请你‘justify’一下。”你就解释一番；我说：“嗯，好，我明白了。”你“justify”了你的说法。你改变了那句话吗？没有。你没有改一个字一个标点。你改变的是什么？是我对那句话的态度、是我和那句话之间的关系。

当经文说，我们的过犯所带来的后果落在他身上的时候，也同时意味着：他那完美生命的一切后果，同样要落在我们身上。这就是做一个基督徒的本质所在。做一个基督徒的本质是什么？是努力像耶稣那样生活吗？不是，那只是结果。事实上，对我们大多数人而言，那甚至算得上是“偶然属性”。本质是什么？

当耶稣——你看哥林多后书5章21节，其实就是对以赛亚53章的浓缩总结：“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”这是什么意思？“耶稣基督成为罪”是什么意思？难道是说他变得有罪吗？不是。难道是说他变得邪恶、肮脏、可怕吗？也不是。那是什么意思？意思是：在上帝眼中，他被视为好像做了人类历史上所有污秽的事。

那么，“我们在他里面成为义”又是什么意思？大多数人会以为：好，如果我要做一个基督徒，我就得先把自己整理好。我确实需要整理生命，但那不是本质。使你成为基督徒的是：那一刻，当你相信他，并且说：“父啊，因耶稣的缘故——因为他在历史中所做成的——请接纳我”；就在那一刻，根据这段经文，意味着什么？意味着上帝把耶稣所做的一切完全都记在你的帐上。

这里还有一件事：你可能会问，这怎么可能？让我从另一个角度说。在这段经文中，你可以看到耶稣之死的“自愿性”。经文多次强调他“甘心承担”。比如：“他诚然担当我们的忧患”，那“担当”在原文里是一个非常主动的动词，意思是他把我们的忧患从我们身上“扛起来”，好像从我们身上取下来扛到自己身上一样。又比如多次出现的“他不开口”、“他不开口”、“他不开口”。这是什么意思？意思就是他是自愿的，他自愿去死。

你会说：世上也有很多人为别人舍命啊，他们的故事也很感人。是的，但他们当中没有一个像他那样自愿。让我解释：有些人为别人舍命，有些人自杀——难道他们都是“自愿”的？不，全不是。他们所选择的，只是“怎么死”。他们并没有选择“死不死”，因为他们无论如何都会死。你无法选择“死不死”，你本来就会死。你所能选择的，是“怎么死”。即便你说：“我选择去死”，然后自杀，你仍然是死亡的受害者。你并没有选择死亡本身，因为你本来就会死；你根本不可能阻止它、也无法拖延它。

耶稣是历史上唯一一位死去却不是死亡受害者的人。耶稣是唯一一位真正自愿死去的人，是唯一一位从来不必死的人。他本来不必死。他是美丽的，却自愿成为丑陋；他是无限的，却自愿成为有限；他是永恒的，却自愿走进死亡。这是一件至高权能的行动。有人这样形容：好像耶稣基督把自己的身体抓在一只手里，把自己的灵魂抓在另一只手里，然后亲手把自己撕裂。他说：“我舍命，乃是出于自己。”

这意味着什么？这对你的心意味着什么，对你的理性又意味着什么？我们最后就从这两方面来讲。首先，这对你的“心”意味着什么？当你思想十字架时，要问：是什么让耶稣留在十字架上的？有很多人为别人舍命，他们的事迹也打动我们。而当我们接触到这种“替代”时，总觉得生命最深处有什么东西被触动了——好像“替代”就是生命的真正意义。

每当你在故事里看见这种替代，就会被深深打动。比如，《最后的莫希干人》的电影版（The Last of the Mohicans）。你记得吗，那些女人即将被杀，这时 Daniel Day-Lewis 演的那位“纳撒尼尔·波”（Nathaniel Poe），也就是长发侠，冲进来，对印第安酋长说：“让我代替她们。”他说：“我来代替她们，我来代替她们。杀我，不要杀她们。”可是酋长听不懂他的语言，他听不懂法语，也听不懂那种语言。所以他只能通过翻译来表达。

你记得翻译是谁吗？邓肯。邓肯正是其中一个女人被他拒绝的追求者。邓肯开口说话，却说：“让我代替她们。”他们把邓肯吊起来杀了，而那几个女人得以逃跑。当你看这一幕，心中有什么被触动了？你会说：这就是生命的意义，这是极美的东西。

再比如，《双城记》（A Tale of Two Cities），狄更斯写的故事。西尼·卡顿（Sydney Carton）爱上了一个女人，但那女人嫁给了查尔斯·达奈（Charles Darnay）。不久，达奈被关进牢里，即将被送上断头台。西尼·卡顿长得和他很像，就去牢里看他，对他说：“我要和你换。”达奈惊呼：“什么？”西尼就把他打晕，把自己的衣服换给他，让达奈穿上囚犯的衣服，自己则穿上自由人的衣服，然后他去死。

在书的结尾，卡顿假扮成达奈，排队等候上断头台。身边有一个年轻的女孩，看见他说：“嘿，你认识我，我以前和你一起在这里、在那里……”她抬头一看，发现那不是查尔斯·达奈，她的脸一下子变白了，说：“你是为他而死吗？”他说：“是的。”她说：“牵着我的手，只要有像你这样的人跟我在一起，我想我就能面对任何事。”你看，这里面发生了什么？没有任何东西比这种故事更能动人。这就是罪的反面。

罪的本质是“我先”，救恩的本质是“你先”；罪的本质是“你的生命为我的生命”，救恩的本质是“我的生命为你的生命”。当耶稣基督死在十字架上的时候，是什么把他钉在那里？是他对你的爱，除此之外别无他物。这意味着什么？意味着不管你做了什么，你都不可能把他的爱摔碎。

想一想，他经历了什么？他承受了上帝的愤怒、刑罚、这一切。而你有些日子坐在那里说：“我最近太不稳定了，我太愚蠢、太迷糊，做了这些、做了那些。我不知道耶稣会不会放弃我。”你凭什么觉得，你的反复无常、你的愚蠢，会把“小小的耶稣的爱”给磨光掉，而这一切（十字架上的刑罚）都磨不掉呢？他对你的爱经受住了地狱倾倒出来的一切惩罚，却没有放弃。这是一份完全自愿的爱，他为你舍己。这是你的心必须知道的：这是一份坚固的爱，你不可能把它磨穿，你不可能把它耗尽。

最后，再说一点与你“理性”有关的。耶稣来到世上，不只是通过死来成全上帝的律法；他也通过活着成全了律法的一切要求。他过的是一段完全不以自我为中心的生命，他完全爱邻舍、完全爱神。另一种说法是：我要闯红灯的罚单，我掏了几次，已经记不太清了（可能是75美金吧）。满足红灯法规有两种方式：一种是停下，另一种是付75美元。不管哪一种，都算是满足了红灯的法规。那么，你怎样满足上帝的律法？要么“尽心、尽性、尽意、尽力爱主你的神，并且爱人如己”；要么“承担违背律法的刑罚”。在十字架上，耶稣一边承担刑罚，一边仍在尽心尽意爱神、爱人。他双重地成全了上帝的律法。

他担当了我们的罪，就把他的记录——那完美的记录——留给了我们。这对你意味着什么？意味着你生命的意义，在两方面都和十字架息息相关。如果十字架对你而言说不通，你的生命就不会说得通。除非你从十字架的角度看生命，否则你总要担心自己的舒适，因为最大的疾病还没被治好；你总会担心自己的外表，因为真正的美还没披在你身上；你总会担心自己的名声，因为你还没有那位唯一真正重要的那一位说“我爱你”。

然而，如果十字架向你显明这一切，你就会发现：当你走入这个世界时，以前那些困扰你的东西慢慢就不再困扰你。苦难仍会发生，你仍会生病，但“终极的疾病”已经被治愈；你仍可能被人误解、被人伤害，但“终极的名声”——那位唯一真正重要的那一位对你的看法——已经为你牢牢确立了。

所以，当你往前行的时候，十字架不只是给你一个情感的泉源，使你能面对生命的各种问题；同时也给你智慧，看见：这是耶稣来的道路——这是耶和华膀臂的软弱。“软弱”里有力量。生命当中许多最美好的事，往往正是透过软弱、受苦、患难、困境而临到的。除非十字架成为你生命的喜乐，否则你的生命都不会真的说得通。除非十字架说得通，你的生命就说不通。

而不仅如此：十字架不仅解释你的生命，也成了你生命的模式。当你真正明白十字架使你何等富足时，你就会开始像耶稣那样活——你会说：“不是你的生命为我，乃是我的生命为你”，你会“花费”自己，把自己摆上。

有件有趣的事值得一提：这里提到的“受欺压、受苦”——“他受欺压”、“他受审判”、“他被剪除”、“他被暴力对待”。我们当中绝大多数人，在这世上一生可能都不会经历这样的不公。然而，最了不起的地方在于：如果你不相信上帝，“受苦”和“不公”就成了一个骇人的难题。你会说：“为什么会有这种事？如果上帝不存在，那为什么我心里会有这么强烈的反感？”因为如果没有上帝，“强者吃掉弱者”完全是自然不过的事，是再正常不过的运作方式。你凭什么生气，说世上应当“不一样”？现实就是这样的。

所以，他说：如果你不相信上帝，受苦和不公是个巨大难题；而如果你相信上帝，受苦和不公仍是巨大难题——因为你会问：他为何不制止？但在众多宗教所呈现的诸神当中，只有一位神亲自进入这种不公之中，自己成为不公的受害者。因此，当任何其他神说：“我有我的理由”时，听起来都很空洞；可是当你面对的是一位自己受过不公对待的神，你就有理由信靠他，也有理由开始为其他受过同样对待的人而活。“我的生命为你的生命。”这就是做一个基督徒的本质。

我们一起祷告。天父，我们为这段伟大的经文向你献上感谢。从某种意义上说，这是在一个新地方开始一个敬拜群体的极好起点。我们在这里看见福音的本质，看见罪的本质，看见救恩的本质，也看见我们如今应当如何活的本质。

我们感谢你，因为你是那位曾经作过不公受害者的独一真神，而不是那位不公的施行者。你使我们在你里面何等富足，以至于我们可以为其他受害者花费自己。你成了软弱的一位，好让我们看见：在软弱里有真正的力量。父啊，我们求你帮助我们明白这些真理，把它们深深加工在我们的生命里，不仅是我们个人，也是我们在这个地方的敬拜群体。

我们感谢你。我们祈求，在接下来的聚会中，当我们向你祷告、向你献上这些时，你要塑造我们、陶造我们的心，使之更像我们刚才所看见的那位——那伟大的“仆人”、那公义的耶稣基督。奉他的名祷告，阿们。

在今天的教导中，提姆·凯勒探讨了圣经关于罪的教导如何给我们一个极其诚实却又充满希望的世界观。我最近在读以西结书，以西结与被掳的人在一起，他在遥远的异乡，许多他的犹太同胞都在说我们怎能在异国敬拜神，然后他得到了这个异象？你读过的。这很奇特，但以西结异象中最重要的是他看到神高高在上，看到神坐在宝座上，但以西结的异象与以赛亚的异象或其他任何人关于神宝座的异象有所不同。如果你看宝座的底部，他发现神的宝座有轮子。

这是一位可以移动的神，这是神在说我可以为你们建造一个家，我可以居住在任何地方，绝对任何地方。所以欢迎回家。现在让我向你们读以赛亚书52章13节，从13节到53章末尾，52章13节到53章，看哪，我的仆人行事必有智慧。他必被高举上升，且成为至高，正如许多人因他惊奇。他的面貌比别人憔悴，他的形容比世人枯槁。

照样，他必洗净许多国民，君王要向他闭口，因所未曾传与他们的，他们必看见，未曾听见的，他们要明白。我们所传的有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？他在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。他被藐视，被人厌弃，多受痛苦，常经忧患。

好像被人掩面不看的一样，他被藐视，我们也不尊重他。他诚然担当我们的忧患，背负我们的痛苦，我们却以为他受责罚，被神击打苦待了。哪知他为我们的过犯受害，为我们的罪孽压伤，因他受的刑罚我们得平安，因他受的鞭伤我们得医治。我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路，耶和华

主将我们众人的罪孽都归在他身上。他被欺压，被苦待，却不开口。

他像羊羔被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊在剪毛的人面前静默无声，他也是这样不开口。因受欺压和审判，他被夺去，至于他同世的人，谁想他受鞭打，从活人之地被剪除，是因我百姓的罪过呢？他虽然未行强暴，口中也没有诡诈，人还使他与恶人同埋，但死的时候与财主同葬。耶和华却定意将他压伤，使他受痛苦；耶和华以他为赎罪祭，他必看见后裔，并且延长年日，耶和华所喜悦的事必在他手中亨通。他必看见自己劳苦的功效，便心满意足。

因他的知识，我的义仆必使许多人得称为义，并且他要担当他们的罪孽。所以我要使他与位大的同分，与强盛的均分掳物，因为他将命倾倒，以至于死，他也被列在罪犯之中，他却担当多人的罪，又为罪犯代求。这是神的话语。我猜今晚可能有一些新来的人还没有参加过这个系列，这其实是一个系列的一部分，我们一直在讨论我们有什么问题。我是指人类。

我刚看了一部电影的录像，我想是去年上映的，叫做《天堂之路》，讲述的是二战期间苏门答腊战俘营的真实故事，所有这些真实故事，无论是兰登·吉尔基的《山东集中营》这本书，还是维克多·弗兰克尔对死亡集中营的记述，或是这部电影，它们当然都很扣人心弦，但远不止于此。大屠杀中发生了什么？二战中发生了什么？战场上发生了什么，战俘营中发生了什么？是这样的：在那之前大约一百年里，在西方非常非常流行的乐观的人性观。这些乐观的观点，基本上说邪恶是糟糕的家庭环境造成的。

养育不当、缺乏教育、社会化过程不正确，或只是虚假意识。

所有这些乐观的方法都被摧毁了。它们之所以被摧毁，是因为当你处于这些经历之中时，当他们处于第二次世界大战之中时，两个问题不断浮现。你看，我们到底怎么了，竟然能做出这样的事？我们该如何应对？我们出了什么问题，我们如何解决它？而这一章有趣的地方在于，很容易忘记这是写给谁的。关于以赛亚书，学者们有很多分歧，但有一件事大家都同意，那就是以赛亚书第40章到55章是为一个面临流放的民族写的，是写给即将面对我们所谈论的一切——囚禁、暴行、监狱的以色列人。

这是写给他们的，为了回答同样的两个问题：人类到底出了什么问题，我们该如何应对？而这就是答案，也许是最好的答案，也许是圣经中关于人类邪恶问题最著名的答案。答案是这样的：神差遣某个人，主的仆人，而我们在文本中学到的是，我们了解他是谁，他为何而来，他做了什么——基本上是一切，对吧？他是谁，他为何而来，他做了什么。让我们来看看，首先是他是谁。现在这段经文里有很多内容，当我们看到开头时，你会很直接地看到，经文说：看哪，我的仆人必行事有智慧，他必被高举，被提升，被尊为至高。实际上，这与以赛亚在圣殿中看到的那位的描述是相同的术语，在以赛亚书第6章中说，我去了圣殿，我看见主高高在上，被高举——同样的词语，这与神的超越性、超然的威严有关，这与纯洁、完美有关。令人惊讶的是，同样的词语会用在这个人身上。但真正令人惊讶的是第1节，你不会马上注意到，有多种翻译方式，让我告诉你他

第1节说，谁相信了我们的信息，耶和华的膀臂向谁显现了呢？

现在让我稍微解释一下这段话的意思，他说的是谁相信了我们的信息，就是这位就是耶和华的膀臂，这需要启示，以赛亚说，没有人会相信这一位，这位仆人，就是耶和华的膀臂，没有人会相信的，原因如下：耶和华的膀臂不只是以赛亚临时想出来的一个优美的比喻，耶和华的膀臂在希伯来圣经中，尤其是在以赛亚书中，具有非常具体、非常明确的含义。耶和华的膀臂就是主自己进入历史来做具体的事情。耶和华的膀臂就是那分开红海的力量。你看，耶和华的膀臂不是指神一般性的能力，当然膀臂，如果是耶和华的眼睛，我们就会谈论神的知识，但耶和华的膀臂是神的能力，但不是任何一种能力，不只是一般性的力量，它是神在历史中的能力。难怪以赛亚说，看，我知道人们不会相信，没有人会相信这就是耶和华的膀臂显现，这就是耶和华的膀臂。

这个人就是全能的神进入历史。在我们继续之前，我们必须继续，让我说说这段经文的精彩之处，它涉及到本质。事实上，我越看这段经文，谁是他，以及他为什么来，你知道，他来要做什么。这真的给出了一种本质性的定义，整段经文例如，你知道，亚里士多德给我们带来了他所说的本质和偶然属性的区分，本质的和偶然的。比如说，如果你从未见过粘土，你生命中从未见过钢铁？

然后我在你面前放一个粘土球和一根工字钢梁，我说，好的，粘土和钢铁有什么区别？你看了看说，我知道了，粘土是圆的，钢铁是长的。你会说，在这里很难笑出来，对吧，但试试看。好的，你知道，你可以在花体字下面笑。你不只需要涂鸦，好的，现在，那是

更好。

你会说，你错过了本质，那些是偶然的，是某种意外。泥土可以塑成各种形状，但形状是本质的，形状不是本质。它是，你知道的，是柔软、坚硬、化学成分，所有这类东西。那么，基督教的本质是什么？嗯，你说基督教引导人们彼此相爱。

是的，是的，但是嘿，有很多不是基督徒的人也非常有爱心。好吧，基督教引导你，它给你力量，给你平安，使你良善。是的，但那些都是偶然的。我不是说它们是意外。我用的是亚里士多德的术语，它们不是，不是本质。

它们不是，它们与许多其他群体的人重叠。什么是本质？基督教的"膀臂性"。我是什么意思？好吧，这就是我的意思。

耶稣基督在这里不是被称为神的口，主的口。他被称为主的膀臂。这并不意味着他不是来教导的。他是一位教师，但他主要不是来告诉你该做什么。他主要是来行动的。

这就是基督教与其他所有宗教的本质区别。耶稣基督本质上不是来——每一位其他创始人都来说，耶稣没有。每一个其他宗教都来说，我要向你展示如何与神连接。做这个。

耶稣基督说，我要让你与神连接。我已经做了这件事，或者换另一种方式说，有很多种方式来表达。这意味着，例如，福音是新闻，不是建议。你看，其他创始人带着建议来，他们说，嘿，这是你如何改变你的生活。但新闻是这是已经发生的事，它改变了你的生活。

现在，如果我，什么？你们中的一些人可能以前听过我说这个，但让我用另一种方式来表达，我认为这更能说明问题。基督教的故事除非是真的，否则不起作用。而其他宗教的故事无论如何都起作用。看，例如，佛教的目的是什么？

佛教是关于什么的？是关于觉悟的。这是一个美妙的信仰。它有很多伟大的东西可以教给我们，是关于觉悟的。它是关于一种对生活的态度，一种对于

苦难，一种不执着、对抗贪欲自我的态度。

那么关于佛陀的所有故事，它们是否真实重要吗？不，不重要。原因如下。我的意思是，它们可能是真的，也可能不是。重点是，它们鼓舞人心，具有典范作用。

它们告诉我如何找到觉悟。它们告诉我如何生活，无论真假它们都有效。穆罕默德，我无意冒犯任何人，但看看关于穆罕默德的故事。伊斯兰教是关于什么的？嗯，伊斯兰这个词意味着顺服、服从，与其说是觉悟，不如说是对真主的服从。

所以关于穆罕默德的所有故事都是这样运作的。无论它们是否真实，它们都向我展示如何顺服，向我展示该做什么，对吧？所以它们有效。让我们看看基督教的故事。好的，让我们看看圣诞故事，出生在马槽里。

好吧，这个故事的寓意是什么？自然分娩？寓意是什么？无家可归也没关系。寓意是什么？

听着，这里没有寓意。故事是这样的，上帝的膀臂。这个理想已经闯入历史。它变成了现实。终于，这已经发生了，它改变了一切。

好吧，事实上，让我，让我们更切中要点。让我们看看摆在我们面前的故事，十字架。这是一个基督教故事。耶稣为我们的罪死在十字架上。那么，这个故事的寓意是什么？

如果这个故事不是真的，想一想这个。你说，哦，嗯，它是否真实并不重要。它只是，它鼓舞人心。哦，真的吗？让我们想一想这个。

这个故事的寓意是什么？不要保护自己。你是什么的受害者，它说的是压迫吗？当压迫降临到你身上时，你就屈服。你就让他们踩在你身上。

你不开口，你不抗议。只是让不公正碾压你，是这样吗？这是故事的寓意吗？那太变态了。你知道，还有另一种说法，好吗？

我这样对你说。假设你和我去了帝国大厦的顶层。我们正在向外看，突然，你走到我面前说，蒂姆，我只是想让你知道我有多爱你。我想让你知道我有多关心你，并且

我要向你展示我有多爱你。然后你爬上悬崖边缘，说，看着。

然后你纵身一跃，坠落而下，摔死了。而我，我俯视悬崖边缘，说，看那个人多爱我。我会吗？不，我会说，那个人怎么了？但如果我，因为我愚蠢或因为我是个傻瓜什么的，如果我自己走到边缘，即将掉下去，而你过来把我推到安全的地方，但在这个过程中你掉了下去？

现在听着，钉十字架是历史上发生的一件改变一切的事。那仆人来承受你的惩罚，改变了一切。如果这不是真的，它不仅仅是不重要，它是坏的。不仅仅是这个故事不成立。如果它不是真的，它实际上会产生坏的作用。

它是变态的，它是有害的。除非这个故事，基督教是真的，除非耶稣基督是那膀臂而不仅仅是那口。看，基督教对你真的很不好。非常、非常糟糕，可怕。要么是这个，要么是那个，他就是耶和华的膀臂。

好的，这就是谁来了。这是神自己在历史中行动。第二，这就是谁来了，以及他为什么现在来。再次，我们要进入本质，因为他来的原因以及他的，看，第四到第六节，有一大堆很好的词汇，几乎涵盖了描述人类罪恶的每一种方式。罪，看，你有软弱。

看，过犯和罪孽。顺便说一下，你们有些人，在所有这些词中，顺便说一下，那几乎是我最喜欢的一个，因为你知道吗？翻译为罪孽的希伯来词，真遗憾。它在英语中根本没有体现出来。它的意思是弯曲的，弯曲的，好吗？

弯曲意味着它不能正常工作，但如果你试图把它弄直，只会让情况更糟。它会断裂。但在所有这些有趣的词语中，有一个词抓住了我们问题的本质。所以这就是问题的答案。我们有什么问题？

就在这里。第六节，非常有名，但被忽视了。我们都如羊走迷，各人偏行己路。现在你说我的话，这是神告诉我们的核心地方，秘密在于我们有什么问题

我们，人类的邪恶。这是对邪恶的定义。

这是对罪的定义，按自己的方式。你说，我的话，我的意思是，你知道，为什么不是谋杀或抢劫或类似的事情？我的意思是，每个小孩都想要按自己的方式。我很高兴你这么说。听着，我的一个朋友，他是终身单身汉。

他是一位传道人，我听他的讲道。但由于他是终身单身汉，当他真正遇到孩子时，他总是以一种我不再有的方式被他们打动，因为我，你知道，作为父母，我已经被他们包围了。有一天他在一个退修会上，他和一个五口之家一起走路，他们正走在去小马围栏的路上。父母对查尔斯说，还有查尔斯、莎拉和萨莉。父母说，现在查尔斯，你整个早上都在骑小马。

轮到莎拉和萨莉了。所以轮到她们了。他说，哦，他点了点头。他们转了个弯。他们接近了围栏。

当他们一接近围栏，查尔斯就冲到所有人前面，跑进人群，跑到负责的工作人员面前，说，我先来。我的朋友，你知道，这很深刻，这是什么样的例证？但他对此感到惊讶。是的，我很惊讶。但后来他突然想到了这一点。

他说，等等。如果这是每个人灵魂中每个微芯片的令人难以置信的核心呢？永远无法被消除？如果这是本质的呢？嗯，有很多很多很多意外。

我的意思是，它有许多形式。但如果这是我们永远无法删除的东西呢？他说，如果"我先来"基本上就是问题所在呢？死亡集中营是什么？战争是什么？

每一起犯罪是什么？每一起犯罪是什么？来吧。每一起犯罪的本质是什么？我先来。

就是这样。我的意思是，多年前，汉堡王有一首歌。记得吗，它有一段小曲。它说，按你的方式来。根据第六节，这就是罪的本质。

弗兰克·西纳特拉唱道，我按我的方式做。根据第六节，这就是罪的本质。但现在，听着，这不仅非常有帮助。非常有帮助地向我们展示，基本上，我的方式。我先来，这如何显示我们的关系

彼此之间，但本质上，它向我们展示了我们与神的关系。

因为它没有说我们都像蛇一样，各人偏行己路。蛇知道自己的路。羊需要牧人。当羊想要走自己的路时，它们所表达的是，我想要成为自己的牧人。而当人走自己的路时，我们所说的是，我想要成为自己的创造者。

我们不完全确定是诗篇100篇源自以赛亚书53章，还是以赛亚书53章源自诗篇100篇。但我听到，听着，诗篇100篇说，你们当晓得耶和华是神。我们是他造的，不是我们自己，我们是他的民，也是他草场的羊。现在，非常简单，听着。这是为什么用违反规则来理解罪不是一个好主意的原因之一。

我们放眼望去，看到的都是破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和我们自己的生活中感受到这一切。这一切是怎么变成这样的，又能做些什么呢？在他本月发行的全新书籍中，这个世界到底怎么了？提姆·凯勒提供了一个清晰而充满同情的答案。

从在救赎主教会的系列教导中汲取，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及为什么只有福音才能提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，正在与自己的错误或选择抗争，还是在寻找希望和喜乐，《这个世界到底怎么了》这本书将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。这本新发行的书籍《这个世界到底怎么了》是我们对你本月的赠礼的感谢，帮助《福音与生命》分享耶稣的好消息。今天就在gospelandlife.com/give索取你的副本。

那就是gospelandlife.com/give。如果你说罪就是违反规则，神的规则，这在某种程度上，这是一个视角，但如果你从这里开始，问题就来了。假设你只是在考试中作弊。你在考试中作弊了。嗯，这有点像偷窃。

所以你想到罪，你实际上可以说，嗯，这只是一个非常小的罪。你只是，你知道，这看起来如此微不足道。因此，

你把罪想象成一堆陶罐。它们都堆在那里，你往堆里扔一个棒球，打碎了一个。哎呀，你走过去，把它拿走。

谁会知道区别呢？我是说，这堆基本上还是完整的。但罪更像是用棒球扔穿一扇窗户。窗户要么完好无损，要么粉碎。关键是，要么上帝是你生命中的上帝。

要么由他说了算，可以这么说。要么你让他成为上帝。这是另一种说法。否则你就是你生命中的上帝。我们用三种方式来表述。

首先，要么你的意志是律法，他的意志是建议。或者看，他的意志是律法，你的意志是建议。让我换一种方式说。如果你说"我顺服"，当它对我来说有意义时，如果它符合我对什么对我有益的看法，如果它符合我的感受，如果你说"我顺服"，如果你所说的是，我的意志、我的智慧、我的目标，在审判上帝的。如果你说"我顺服"，无论如何，"我顺服"，即使它要了我的命，"我顺服"，即使我是地球上最后一个这样做的人，"我顺服"，无论它让我付出什么代价，"我顺服"，无论我是否理解，"我顺服"，无论它是否实用，"我顺服"，无论它是否相关，那么并且只有那时。

你是在说上帝的智慧，上帝的意志和上帝的目标在审判我的。现在只能是其中之一。没有中间地带。不是说你打破了几条规则，但基本上这堆还是完整的。这是上帝之为神的原则。

谁是牧者？谁是羊？谁是主？谁是仆人？谁的意志是律法？

谁的意志是建议？只能是其中之一。中间什么都没有。完全没有。这就是如此有趣的地方。

它说，如果你决定要在自己的生活中说了算，这不是那么多，嘿，这不是那么多，比如说，在考试中作弊。这本质上是为了你自己的幸福而活，为了你自己的舒适而活，为了你自己的荣耀而活。只是在做决定时不参考上帝，只是忽视上帝，就是你打碎了玻璃。你扭曲了你的灵魂。什么都不会正常运作了。

如果你读完这里，而我没有

有时间去做，你的情感不会起作用。它告诉你这一点。你的理智也不会起作用。他激怒了他。我们以为他一文不值。

这就是它的字面意思。你的情感不起作用。当你看着他时，你不会渴望他。我的意思是，什么都不会起作用。好了，在我们进入最后一点之前，还有一点。

这就是他来的原因。他来是因为在每个人心灵的外部微芯片上，都有一些无法删除的、看似微不足道的东西，那就是：我想成为上帝。我想成为我自己的上帝。我优先，这是一切痛苦的根源。这就是他来的原因。

但有一点小事。想一想这个。基督徒经常被指责在智识上把头埋在沙子里，顺便说一句，这是真的。然而，更容易的是，不仅仅是容易。普通人在与上帝的关系上，绝对是把头埋在沙子里的。

我想这样说。我想这样表达。根据这一点。如果上帝是你的创造者。如果上帝创造了你。

如果你是被上帝创造的。你欠他一切。绝对是一切。你应该让他成为那个掌控一切的人。对吗？

否则，你就是扭曲的。否则，这是可怕的。这是错误的。这是不公平的。这是愚蠢的。

你必然会死，就像那些以为自己可以当牧羊人的被塑造的羊一样必然会死。所以，你看，如果上帝创造了你，那么你必须完全地跟随他。完全是让上帝成为第一位。如果他没有创造你，那么你走自己的路是有理由的。如果你不是被任何人创造的，当然你属于你自己。

但那样的话你的生命就毫无意义。如果你不是被创造的，你就是一个意外。你毫无目的地来到这个世界。无论你做什么，一切都会腐烂。一切都会燃烧殆尽。

你确实没有带来任何不同。如果你的起源不重要，你的归宿也不重要，那就有点智识上的勇气承认你的生命不重要，而这就是你所拥有的一切。如果你被创造，你必须把一切都给他。如果你没有把一切都给他，那么你的生命就完全没有意义。就是这样。

你要么是扭曲的，要么你是

毫无意义。非此即彼。而几乎没有人会这样思考。因为几乎没有人会说,如果我认识的每个人都说,嗯,我必须决定什么对我来说是对是错。他们不会说,嗯,那意味着我的生命是完全毫无意义的。

或者我在违抗创造我的上帝。你不会这样做。你会说什么呢?嗯,你只是随大流,跟着其他人说的走。你根本没有思考。

你把头埋在沙子里。现在,你是无意识的。对此有所了解。这里有些东西。我还在吗?

是的。我想我踢到了什么东西,抱歉。你是无意识的。你的半意识知道。这就是为什么你的加卡尔在死亡的疾病中。

萨特称之为恶心。在内心深处,你知道这一点。要么有一位上帝,现在我就是一切。要么我不是。

我可以成为自己的创造者。而一切都没有意义。非此即彼。嗯,几乎没有人会想清楚这一点。你不想想清楚。

但我恭敬地请求你想清楚。现在,最后。看到了吗?他是谁?他为什么来?

他做了什么。现在,我们这里还有一个本质。你知道,他是谁的本质,我们高贵的主。罪的本质。罪的本质是什么?

并没有真正定义它。是吗?罪的本质就是我们用自己取代上帝。把我们自己放在只有上帝才配在你生命中占据的位置。那么,救恩的本质是什么?

答案就在第4、5和6节中。那就是上帝用他自己取代我们。这就是生命的意义,替代。看,首先,在第4节,它说,抱歉,第5节,他为我们的过犯受刺伤。他为我们的罪孽被压伤。

现在,在希伯来文中并不说"为"。如果完全按照希伯来文的字面意思翻译成英文是行不通的。它说他从我们的过犯受刺伤。他从我们的罪孽被压伤。这是希伯来文的说法,意思是他被压伤是因为。

看,实际上就是他受刺伤是因为。等等,等等,等等。我们过犯的后果,降临到他身上。看,我们罪孽的后果,降临到他身上。然后,看这里,第11节。

哎呀,抱歉,看这里,

第11节。经文说,因他的知识,我的义仆必使许多人称义。我的义仆必使许多人称义。你知道称义这个词是什么意思吗?想一想。

在英语中,这是说得通的。假如你发表了一个声明,而我不喜欢它,或者我对此感到不安,或者我不认同,所以我来找你,我说,你发表了一个声明,请证明那个声明是正当的。然后你说,好,让我解释一下,然后你做了一些解释。我说,哦,好的。没问题。

你证明了它是正当的。很好。你刚才做了什么?你改变那个声明了吗?没有。

你一点都没改变它。你没有改变一个字。你没有改变一个字母。但你所做的,是改变了我对它的态度。你改变了我与它的关系。

当经文说我们的过犯已经归到他身上。它也在说他有完美的生命,而那完美生命的后果,将临到我们身上。正如神,这里讲的是作为基督徒的本质。作为基督徒的本质是什么?努力尝试像耶稣那样生活吗?

不,那是结果。事实上,在我们大多数人的情况中,那是附带的。本质是什么?当耶稣,你知道,哥林多后书5章21节,绝对是在总结以赛亚书53章全部内容,是这样说的。神使那无罪的,替我们成为罪,好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。

这是什么意思?说耶稣基督成为罪是什么意思?这是说他变得有罪了吗?不是。这是说他变得邪恶、肮脏、可怕了吗?

不是。这是什么意思?这意味着神待他如同他做了人类曾经做过的每一件该死的事情。那么,在他里面成为义又是什么意思呢?我知道你们大多数人是怎么想的。

你说,我想成为基督徒。我必须改正我的行为。是的,你确实要这样做,但那不是本质。使你成为基督徒的是,当你相信他的那一刻,你说,父啊,因着耶稣的缘故,因着他在历史中所做的,接纳我。就在那一刻,根据这段经文,这意味着神把耶稣所做的一切都算在你的账上。

随之而来的事情之一是

在这里表现出来,你会说,怎么可能呢?让我告诉你。这里面表现出来的一点是耶稣死亡的自愿性。嗯,他死亡的自愿性体现在这句话里,他担当了我们的软弱,这是一个非常主动的词。从某种意义上说,他把它们从我们身上拿起来,放在自己身上。

或者所有这些地方说他不开口,他不开口,他不开口。这都是什么意思?他是自愿的。他自愿死去。嗯,你会说很多人自愿死去。

不,他们没有。没有人像耶稣那样自愿死去。让我说,有没有人为他人献出生命的,有没有人自杀的?不,不,不,不,等一下。等一下。

他们自愿...不。他们所做的是选择,什么时候?他们没有选择去死。你不能选择去死。

你将会死。他们选择的是如何死。他们没有选择去死。即使你说,我选择去死,然后你自杀,你仍然是死亡的受害者。你没有选择去死。

你本来就会死。你永远无法阻止它。你永远无法推迟它。耶稣是唯一一个死去却不是死亡受害者的人。耶稣是唯一一个真正自愿死去的人。

唯一一个不必死去的人。永远不必死去。耶稣本是美丽的,他自愿变得丑陋。耶稣本是无限的,他自愿变得有限。耶稣本是永恒的,他自愿死去。

这是一个至高权柄的行为。这就是为什么有人说单单耶稣基督。他的死就像这样。几乎就像耶稣基督一手拿着他的身体,一手拿着他的灵魂,然后把自己撕裂开来。他说,我照着自己的意愿舍去我的生命。

现在这意味着什么呢?嗯,它对你的心和你的理解都有意义,然后我们就要结束了。这是它对你的心意味着的东西。内心。是什么把耶稣钉在十字架上?

想想看。是什么把他钉在十字架上?我是说,有很多人为别人死去。那些可以感动你。我们灵魂深处的某种东西告诉我们,替代是生命的意义。

每当你在故事中接近它时,

你知道,《最后的莫希干人》剧本的电影版本。记得吗,那些女人即将被杀,然后你知道的,丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯,拉隆加·加勒比,你知道,纳撒尼尔·坡,至少在故事里是这样。他来了,对印第安酋长说,让我代替她。你看,让我代替她们,让我代替她们。

杀我而不是她们。但他不懂法语。你看,他不懂那种语言。所以他必须通过翻译。

还记得翻译是谁吗?邓肯。邓肯,被其中一个女人拒绝的追求者。邓肯开始说话,但邓肯说的是,让我代替她们。然后他们把邓肯吊起来,记得吗?

然后他们杀了他?这样她们才能逃脱。你看到这一幕?有些东西打动了你。这就是生命的意义。

这是令人惊叹的事。或者,你知道,《双城记》。查尔斯·狄更斯的精彩之作。西德尼·卡顿爱上了那个女人,但她嫁给了查尔斯·达内。但查尔斯·达内很快就被关进监狱了,他将被处决。

他要上断头台了。西德尼·卡顿,长得很像查尔斯·达内,来看查尔斯·达内,说,我要和你交换。什么?他基本上把那个人打晕了。他穿上了死囚的衣服...

你看,他穿上了死囚的衣服。死囚穿上了自由人的衣服。西德尼·卡顿死了。顺便说一下,在接近尾声时,西德尼·卡顿,假扮成查尔斯·达内,他在队列中,准备上断头台,有一个女人,一个年轻女孩在那里,说,嘿,你认识我,我曾经和你在这里,在那里,她抬起头,意识到这不是查尔斯·达内。她的脸变得苍白。

她说,你是在为他而死吗?他说,是的。她说,握住我的手。有像你这样的人,我想我能面对任何事情,和像你这样的人在一起。然后看看,那里发生了什么?

没有什么比这更感人的了。这是罪的反面。罪的反面是我优先。救赎是你优先。罪的本质是,看,用你的生命换我的。

救赎的本质是用我的生命换你的。而

当耶稣基督在十字架上受死时，是什么把他固定在那里？是他对你的爱，别无其他，完全没有其他。这意味着，无论你做什么，你都不可能破坏他对你的爱。想想看。

这需要什么？需要神的忿怒。需要刑罚。需要所有这些东西。而现在，有些日子，你坐在那里说，我一直如此不稳定。

我一直如此愚蠢。我一直如此愚昧。我做了这个。我做了那个。我不知道耶稣是否会放弃我。

你的不稳定，你的愚昧，会破坏可怜的耶稣那微小的爱吗？既然这些都没有破坏它？这对你的爱承受了地狱所能给予的一切，它没有放弃。他是完全自愿的。他为你舍己。这是你的心必须知道的事。

这是一份坚强的爱。你不可能耗尽它。你不可能穿透它。但是，这里还有最后一件事关于你的理解。这不仅是你需要知道的事情，如果你需要为了你的理解而知道这一点。

耶稣基督在来到世上时本质上两次成全了神的律法，因为他不仅仅是死来成全律法。他活出了令人难以置信的生命。在那其中，他自愿为别人舍己。他实际上确实爱他的邻舍。你看，完全地。

换一种说法是这样。我不知道这花费了多少，因为我已经让你们中的一些人知道了。纽约市有红绿灯的法律。有两种方法来满足红绿灯的法律。一种是停车。

另一种是支付75美元，我想是这样。无论哪种方式，你都满足了红绿灯的法律。你如何满足神的律法？尽心、尽性、尽力爱你的神，并爱邻舍如同自己？或者支付刑罚？

在耶稣基督里，当他在支付刑罚时，正在尽心、尽性、尽力爱神，并且爱我和他的邻舍如同自己。所以他两次成全了神的律法。你看，他担当了我们的罪。那留下了他的记录给我们，他完美的记录给我们。听着，这样说吧。

这对你意味着什么？这意味着你生命的意义是十字架，以两种方式。除非十字架对你有意义，否则生命不会

才说得通。除非你首先透过十字架看见，你就不必再那么担心你的舒适了，因为那个大病已经永远从你身上除去了。你不必那么担心你的外貌，因为那伟大的美已经永远披在你身上了。

你不必那么担心你的名声，因为那唯一重要的那位爱你。这意味着什么？这意味着当你走向世界时，那些过去困扰你的东西就不再困扰你了。苦难会发生。你会生病，但你看那大病已经治愈了。

你会被虐待，但你看，那伟大的名声是你的。所以发生的是，你透过十字架继续前行，不仅给你一口情感的井来处理生活的问题，而且其次，它给你智慧去看见，看，这就是耶稣来的方式。这就是主的膀臂的软弱。很多时候，生命中发生的最好的事情，是因为透过软弱、苦难、困难和艰难。直到十字架成为你生命的喜乐，生命对你才说得通。

直到十字架说得通，生命才说得通。然后，不仅十字架会让你的生命说得通，十字架随后成为你生命的模式。这是多么美妙的事。如果你理解十字架，你会感到如此富足，以至于你开始像耶稣那样生活。你基本上会说，不是你的生命或我的生命，而是我的生命为了你，你舍己。

你知道这有什么有趣的吗？苦难和压迫，他受压迫。他是不公义的受害者。他在活人之地被剪除。他是暴力之债的接受者。

我们这个房间里的大多数人永远不会经历那种不公义。哦，这里很棒的是这个。如果你不相信神，不公义和苦难是一个可怕的问题，你知道为什么吗？这是一个巨大的奥秘。你为什么会不安，这是个奥秘。

因为你看，如果没有神，那么强者吃弱者是完全自然的，完全自然的。那你凭什么坚持它应该是另一种方式而成为神呢？这就是事情的本来面目。所以他说，苦难和

不公义是个可怕的问题，如果你不相信上帝的话。但如果你确实相信上帝，那么它就变成了一个可怕的问题，因为他为什么不阻止它呢？

但在我们所拥有的所有神明和至少呈现给我们的所有不同宗教中，只有一位上帝曾亲身参与其中。所以当任何其他神说，我有充分的理由，你知道，这听起来相当空洞。但当你拥有一位实际上曾是不公义的受害者的上帝时，你最好信任祂。你最好开始为其他经历过同样事情的人而活。我的生命为了你的生命。

这就是成为基督徒的本质。让我们祷告。天父，我们感谢你这个伟大的概览。在某些方面，这是一个很好的方式来开始一项服务，一个在新地方的敬拜群体。我们看到了福音的本质，罪的本质，救恩的本质以及我们现在应该如何生活的本质。

我们感谢你，我们拥有唯一一位曾是不公义受害者而非施暴者的上帝。一位使我们如此富足，以至于我们可以为其他受害者倾尽所有的上帝。一位变得软弱以便我们能看到软弱即是力量的上帝。天父，我们祈求你帮助我们理解这些事情并将它们融入我们的生活，不仅作为个人，而且作为在这个地方的敬拜群体。我们感谢你，主。

我们祈求在接下来的崇拜中，当我们向你祷告，当我们将这些献给你时，你可以塑造我们，按照我们刚才所看到的形象来陶造我们的心。那位伟大的仆人，耶稣基督，那义者，我们奉祂的名祷告。阿们。
