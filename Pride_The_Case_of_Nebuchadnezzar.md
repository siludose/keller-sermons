### Introduction: The Broken World

Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question, what's wrong with us? Knowing us how the Bible's teaching on sin offers the only explanation deep enough to face the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerful enough to transform us.

### The Story of Nebuchadnezzar

Let me read you the story of Nebuchadnezzar, which you actually just listened to. This is found in Daniel chapter 4, it really starts at the very beginning of the chapter. And in the beginning of the chapter, Daniel is called in by Nebuchadnezzar, the great king of Babylon, to interpret a dream for him. And we'll get into that and describe that dream, but we take this up, our reading at verse 24, and this is Daniel speaking.

> "This is the interpretation, O King, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my Lord the King. You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of the heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he pleases."

**The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules.**

### The Sleep of Pride

Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, he said, "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?" The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, "This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar. Your royal authority has been taken from you."

### The Heart of Pride

Pride, spiritual pride, is that which says, looks at life and looks at all the things in life and says, "I did it and I'm doing it. I did it. By my mighty power, I'm doing it for the glory of my majesty. Life is by me and for me."

**Pride is that which claims to be the author of what is really a gift. Pride is a form of cosmic plagiarism.**

### The Outcome of Pride

Nebuchadnezzar becomes an animal. We understand what happened, we understand now that he went insane, it was a physiological thing, it was a brain chemistry thing, we know something about this. He thought he was an animal, he began to live as an animal for seven times.

### The Healing of Pride

The only way for it to be healed is God has to do it. There's a great story in CS Lewis's Narnia tales about Eustace. He's a proud little boy. And in this particular fairy tale, he falls asleep with greedy thoughts on the hoard of a dragon. And he wakes up and he's been turned into a dragon.

**You have to see that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment. And yet, at the same time, you've got to see that you are the object of the greatest mercy of God.**

### 引言：破碎的世界

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们甚至能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们将原因归结于政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的现象。本月的播客中，Tim Keller 从一系列探讨我们出了什么问题的问题中进行教导。圣经关于罪的教导提供了唯一足够深入的解释，能够面对真相的复杂性，并提供唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

### 尼布甲尼撒的故事

让我为你读尼布甲尼撒的故事，你实际上刚刚听过。这段故事在但以理书第4章，实际上从章节的开头就开始了。在章节的开头，尼布甲尼撒，巴比伦的大王，召见但以理为他解梦。我们会深入探讨并描述那个梦，但我们从第24节开始阅读，这是但以理在说话。

> "王啊，这是解梦，这也是至高者对我主王所发的命令。你必被赶出离开人群，与野兽同居。你要吃草如牛，被天露淋湿。七个时期要经过，直到你承认至高者在人的国中掌权，愿意赐给谁就赐给谁。"

**留下树桩和根的命令意味着当你承认天国掌权时，你的国度将被恢复给你。**

### 骄傲的沉睡

十二个月后，当国王在巴比伦王宫的屋顶上行走时，他说：“这不是我用大能建造的伟大巴比伦吗？为我王宫的居所，为我威严的荣耀吗？”话还在他口中，天上就有声音说：“尼布甲尼撒王啊，有话对你说：你的王权已离开你。”

### 骄傲的核心

骄傲，属灵的骄傲，是那种看待生活并看待生活中所有事物并说：“我做到了，我正在做。我做到了。凭我大能，我为我威严的荣耀而做。生活是由我和为我而存在的。”

**骄傲是声称自己是实际上是礼物的作者。骄傲是一种宇宙剽窃。**

### 骄傲的结果

尼布甲尼撒变成了一只动物。我们理解发生了什么，我们现在知道他疯了，这是生理上的事情，是大脑化学的事情，我们对此有所了解。他认为自己是一只动物，开始像动物一样生活了七个时期。

### 骄傲的医治

唯一的医治方法是上帝必须来做。在CS路易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》中有一个关于尤斯塔斯的伟大故事。他是一个骄傲的小男孩。在这个特定的童话故事中，他带着贪婪的想法在龙的宝藏上入睡。当他醒来时，他已经变成了一条龙。

**你必须看到你不配从上帝那里得到任何东西，只有审判。然而，同时，你必须看到你是上帝最大怜悯的对象。**
