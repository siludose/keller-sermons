Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in  ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question,  what's wrong with us?

Knowing us how the Bible's teaching unsin offers the only explanation deep enough to face  the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us. Let me read you the story of Nebuchadnezzar, which you actually just listened to. This found in Daniel chapter 4, it really starts at the very beginning of the chapter. And in the beginning of the chapter, Daniel is called in by Nebuchadnezzar, the great king  of Babylon, to interpret a dream for him. And we'll get into that and describe that dream, but we take this up, our reading at verse  24, and this is Daniel speaking.

This is the interpretation of King. And this is the decree the most high has issued against my Lord the King. You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of the heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign  over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he pleases.

The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will  be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules. Before O King, be pleased to accept my advice, renounce your sins by doing what is right  and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed, it may be that then your prosperity  will continue. All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,  he said, is not this the great Babylon. I have built as the royal residence by my mighty power.

Only for the glory of my majesty. The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven. This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar. Your royal authority has been taken from you. You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals.

You will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms  of men and gives them to anyone he wishes. Finally, what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with a dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle  and his nails like the claws of a bird.

And at the end of that time, I Nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my sanity  was restored. Then I praised the most high. I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion. His kingdom endures from generation to generation.

All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him, what have you done? At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendour were returned to me for  the glory of my kingdom. My advisors and nobles sought me out and I was restored to my throne and became even greater  than before.

Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the king of heaven because everything  he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride, he is able to humble. This is God's Word. Now, the only thing funny about Nebuchadnezzar's name, in the 6th century BC, he was the absolute  monarch of the kingdom of the empire of Babylonia. Now, what did that mean?

You know, Tom Wolfe and Bonfire of the Vanities coined a phrase, Masters of the Universe. And these, of course, were a name that he put in the mind of some big Wall Street guy  who felt he was on top of the world because he made seven figures. And Tom Wolfe said in his heart, he thought of himself as part of that elite little group  of people, Masters of the Universe, by my mighty power, for the glory of my majesty. I have really gotten on top of the world. But you know, here it's a real master of the universe, not just somebody who lives, you  know, around the corner here.

They were the absolute monarchs of every part of the world they knew of. Every part of the world that he knew or his civilization knew anything about, he was  the absolute monarch of. And so, he built the, maybe the most incredible city in history. He built Babylon as his personal residence. And proportionately, to the rest of the world, it was much bigger than New York City  as now.

And he had had something else. Imagine New York, all of its power, all of its diversity, and green. Because what Nebuchadnezzar did, and you can, one of the seven wonders of the ancient  world, the hanging gardens of Nebuchadnezzar, what he did at Babylon was he made skyscrapers  of the kind they were able to do then. He created this incredible city and it was like a park. The hanging gardens of Babylon.

And yet, though here's somebody at the pinnacle of power, maybe a kind of power that only  a half dozen people in all of history have ever known. His life falls apart anyway. And when it's done, here's the incredible part. He's glad it happened. He's glad.

He praises God for having done it. You know why? Because he says there was a spiritual cancer in me. There was something in me that was so bad. It was so dangerous that it poisoned my soul so deeply that even as drastic as the treatment  was, it was worth it to get it out of my soul.

What is it? Pride. Spiritual pride. And I think there's no place in the maybe the world where it's more important to talk  about this particular guy. In this particular case, because you know, people come to New York with dreams.

Dreams. You come to New York because you're good at something and you come to New York with dreams  of becoming maybe the best at something. And therefore it is maybe no more important place to ask these questions. Could it be that our own minds are as clouded as his was? Could it be, as we're going to see, that our own sleep is being troubled by the same causes  as his was?

Could it be that your life is falling apart right now or your life is about to fall apart  right now for the same reason that his did, for the same lesson that he learned. And if anybody here says, well, I'm not capable of spiritual pride, you should know that in  a biblical diagnostic manual, that's the first sign of it to say something. Let's take a look. What is this teacher's, that's a dirty trick, is it? That anyway, but that's what the Bible teaches.

Listen, this text tells us about pride, four things. It tells us about the sleep of pride, the heart of pride, the outcome of pride and the healing  of pride. Sleep the heart, the outcome of the healing, go through. Sleep. See, you notice it says here 12 months later, you see this?

It says 12 months later. Now what happened 12 months before? If you read the very beginning of the passage, it goes like this, here is one guy you'd think  in the world that would not have any worries, that there'd be nothing to disturb his sleep,  there'd be nothing to disturb him. Here's the one guy in the world that can't ever worry about being fired. See, you know, nobody will ever downsize, you see.

Here's also, you have to say, ah, yes, but he's always worried some army, what army? He's the absolute monarch, nobody else has an army. And he says in verse four, early on in the chapter, we didn't read it, in verse four,  he says, I, Nebuchadnezzar, was in my palace, content and prosperous. And I fell asleep and I was terrified by a dream, content and prosperous, but I was terrified  by a dream. And the dream, in the dream, he saw a tree that reached to the heavens, and it was so  cosmically large that everything in the earth was under the tree.

All the creatures of heaven, everything in the whole world, sheltered under the tree. And it was magnificent, but suddenly in the dream of voice from heaven comes and says,  cut down the tree, strip off its leaves, scatter its fruit, and let the dew of heaven lie upon  the stump for seven times. And what's the purpose of all this? The voice says, and I quote, that the living may know that the most high is sovereign over  kingdoms of the earth, and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the loliest  of men. Well, he's very upset, of course, so Nebuchadnezzar calls Daniel a man of God and says,  Daniel, let me tell you the dream, tell me what it means.

And Daniel, the man of God, when he heard the dream, were told he went white, he blanched,  he was terrified, and he says, and these are his words in verse 22, you, O King, are that  tree? And God is coming to humble you, God is coming to cut you down, God is coming to show  you that you are not a master of the universe, but that you are weak and you are loley and  you live only by his will. So look it, and you see Daniel speaking at the top of this text that we read, he says,  God is coming, he's coming to humble you, and he's concerning, he says, therefore, be  pleased to listen to me. Change, turn, repent, humble yourself, and maybe this won't happen to you. But we're told that 12 months later, something did happen.

But what do we learn here? I'll tell you what we learned before we move on to really talking about the heart of pride. What does this teach us? It teaches us this. No matter how accomplished you think you are, or will be, no matter how successful you  think you are, or will be, contentment and prosperity, the two words that Nebuchadnezzar  used, he says, I was content, I was prosperous, I was Lord of all that I surveyed, but I couldn't  sleep.

No matter how content, no matter how prosperous you think you can get, it's never complete,  never. Nebuchadnezzar knew what only a few people in the world know to really know this, to really  know this, you've got to get to the top, and very, very few of us ever will. I was reading, I was watching an A&E biography on Howard Hughes. Biographies, newspapers, personal acquaintance tells us that the people at the top, top,  the Nebuchadnezzars of life are deeply troubled people. Why?

Because they come to learn what the rest of us deny, and that is that human soul wants  something that is so big, that you can pour all the empires of the world into that  whole, into that heart, you can pour all the empires of the world into your soul and  it not be satisfied. What then is it that we're really after? See only the Nebuchadnezzars of the world really understand this. That's why they're despair, because they can't get content, and they can't get prosperous,  they can't sleep. There's something wrong, there's something missing.

What could it be that you could pour the entire world into? And the Howard Hugheses and the Nebuchadnezzars and the people like that are deeply troubled,  they know what we don't know. The human soul wants something bigger than the world, but what could that be? They didn't know that once, two thousand years ago, there was a little stable that contained  something in it bigger than the world. And at any heart, the simplest, the filthiest, the feeblest, can also have in it something  bigger than the world that really satisfies.

Therefore, no matter how you see pride cannot bring sleep, success, achievement, a sense  of being master of your universe, you aspire to it. Most of us from all of our life trying to get there saying if we could finally get there,  but the ones who have gotten there, they can't sleep. The sleep of pride, okay, secondly, the harder pride. And by the way, another thing we learn from this is that because God's a merciful God and  He sees the terrible outcome of pride, which we're going to look at here in a second, He  will send you voices, He will send you dreams, and He will send you Daniels if only you recognize  them for what they are. What are they?

They're things that are here to tell you you're not in charge. You think you're in charge or you want to be in charge of your life, but you're not. Maybe a Daniel brought you to church today. I hope you recognize these voices and these Daniels and these dreams for what they are,  the merciful messengers of God. Anyway, Nebuchadnezzar doesn't listen.

Twelve months later, he gets up and he says, is not this the great Babylon that I have made  as my royal residence and I have made it by my mighty power and for the glory of my  majesty. That is pride. You want to see what pride is? When he talks about God humbling the proud, he's not talking, there's a kind of pride, there's  a kind of thing we call pride that's good. There's a kind of thing we call pride that's good.

And of course, one of my favorite quotes in all of my life that I've ever read is that  one that describes it. It's by Esok Denison of all people who said pride is faith in the idea that God had when  he made you. And what she means there, see what the Bible teaches is that you are not an accident. God created you. He created with a dignity and with purpose.

He created you with design. And when a human being comes to understand that and grasp what the Bible says, when you  rejoice in it and when you are ravished with that and when you reflect on that, it creates  a stability in you. It creates a joy in you. It creates a kind of confidence in you. That can be called pride, but that's not the kind of pride that Devakita is talking about  here.

When he says, he is able to humble the proud. What he's talking about is this, pride, spiritual pride is that which says, looks at life and  looks at all the things in life and says, I did it and I'm doing it. I did it. By my mighty power, I'm do it for the glory of my majesty. Life is by me and for me.

Let me break that down. Pride, first of all, is that which looks at the good things in your life and says, that's  by me. I did it. I accomplished it. If things go well in your life, you look at that and you say, ask because I worked harder.

Reason I'm doing better than other people is because I've worked harder than other people. Or I worked smarter than other people or I worked more, or ethically than other people  or whatever you say, that's by me. I did it. Therefore, secondly, pride looks at life and the good things at life and says, therefore,  I deserve. Pride looks at life with a very deep sense of owedness.

Pride makes us look at life and say, I am owed these good things. Now, I'll tell you something. Pride has many forms and you've got to be careful. Pride works in a good life or a hard life. Here's how pride works when your life is going well.

You say, I'm getting these good things. I'm doing better than other people because I'm working better than other people. I'm working smarter than other people or harder. You say, and you say, therefore, I'm owed this. When your life is going badly, when things aren't working out, what do you do?

You look at life and you say, I'm suffering more than other people. Things aren't fair. I'm having a harder life than other people. Therefore, I'm owed this. It's the same thing.

Whether your life's going well or whether your life's going poor, poorly,  what it means to be proud is the spiritual pride makes you look at life and say,  I deserve more than I'm getting. Spiritual pride makes you look at life where the things are going well or not and you say,  I should be getting more than I have. I'm owed every bit of this and I'm owed more than what I've got. Now the contrast is humility in the Bible and humility is very different. Pride, let me give you a definition.

Pride is that which claims to be the author of what is really a gift. Pride is what makes you look at your life and say, on the author of it, it's a sheer  gift. Pride is a form of cosmic plagiarism. Something else has been brought into your life. Something's been given to you and you say, I wrote it, I composed it, I did it.

You claim to be the author of that, which is a sheer gift. Community is a completely different approach. Humility looks at life like this, it's a gift. Humility looks at everything. I don't deserve this.

If God gave me what I deserve, I'd be lost, but look at this and this and this, all  these things. It's all gravy. It's all a gift. Now somebody says, oh, that's terrible. You mean you go around a humble person, you're saying a Christian person is humble and you  go around thinking you don't deserve anything?

Boy, that's terrible. That's low self esteem. That's awful. You're saying, I don't deserve everything. That would make you hate life.

No, listen, you're failing to make a distinction. Humility is that which receives life as a gift. There's a kind of false humility that says, I don't deserve this, so I don't want it. I don't deserve this, so I don't want it. I'm too awful.

I'm a failure. I'm a bad person, so I don't want this and this and I don't want friends. I don't want joy. I don't want these things. That's just a reverse kind of pride, you see.

What that is saying is I should earn it. I want to earn it and I won't take it if I haven't earned it and of course you're miserable  and of course you're saying I don't deserve it but deep underneath it is still that sense  of odeness. Real humility says, I don't deserve the good things in my life because if God gave me what  I deserved, I'd be lost but look here they come. See humility has completely gotten rid of the whole concept of pride, the whole system  of pride. Humility says, I couldn't possibly even begin to merit the good things that God's giving  me my health, my mind, my friends.

What I do have, it's all mercy and you say, look at this and therefore everything you  enjoy every day is like this urge. Every day is a surprise. That's what a gift is, a good gift you're surprised, it's better than you thought. You didn't know it was coming. It's absolutely free.

It's undeserved. And you look at everything that way. Everywhere we look we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom  and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own mistakes  or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus. That's your copy today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Now what's so bad about pride? Somebody says, what's so bad about pride? I mean, Nebuchadnezzar looked around and said, didn't I earn this and didn't he? Do you know he was really the greatest military genius of his era? You know he risked his life every time I went into battle.

He can beat all those people single handedly. He wasn't an arm short general in just push buttons. He got in the chair he went out front. He was maybe one of the greatest political leaders in history, didn't he do it? What's so bad about saying that and here's what's so bad in, listen, John wrote, where are  you John?

John wrote, he composed that piece. What if I stole it? What if I put my name on it? If I took it to somebody and said, here, I wrote this and they say, incredible. Not only are you a preacher, you're a wonderful musician.

You're an incredible composer, whoever heard of such a multi gifted person. What have I done? Why would John have the right to be absolutely outraged? Why would you be outraged if you found out about it? Why would you never come back if you found out about it?

Why? Because you would say you've robbed him of his due and you've rested control of his art  from him. Because you see the author owns the work. The author has control over the work and the Bible tells us why we've got pride. Why we don't want to admit that everything in our life is a gift, that nothing we've  got we deserve, that we are dependent on God for every breath, because you see if you  admit that he's the author, if you admit that you are totally dependent on God, then  you have lost control.

And we don't want that. Remember, Dorothy Sayers says, sin is a deep interior dislocation of the soul. It's a desire to keep control of the life and the only way to justify the control of the  life that you have. You have to blind yourself to how dependent you are on him. You say, I don't have control of my life, I'm a religious person, my friends, listen.

This is how the human heart works, even if you're religious. You say, I'll take into consideration, religious tradition, I'll take into consideration, but  I am the final one who determines what I do with my body. I am the final one who determines what I do with my tongue, with my mind, with my money,  me. I have to decide whether it's practical to obey the Bible. If you ever, ever think like that, you're still in charge.

And the only way to justify that is to say, I'm not utterly dependent. I've earned. Here's never can listen, friends, you're so self-made. How much of what you are is really under your control. You did not choose your race, you did not choose your gender, you didn't choose the century  and you which you were born.

You don't think you had nothing to do with the fact that you were born here and now, instead  of in 14th century Europe during the bubonic plague, you don't think that that has a little  impact on what you are today. You say, I've worked hard with what, with the mind, with the talents, with the abilities,  with the friendships, with the connections that God and God alone gave you. You didn't choose your parents, you didn't choose your sibling, you didn't choose any  of your early childhood experiences, all of which we all say are so formative. You didn't choose your basic abilities and talents and the level of those abilities. God says, what, you want to know what humility is?

You want to know what pride is? Paul says, and for as Corinthians 4, 6 and 7, you will not. You will not take pride in one man over another, for what differentiates you from any other,  what do you have that you did not receive as a gift? You will not take pride in one over another, for what makes you different? What do you have that you didn't receive as a gift?

And the Bible says, that's what humility is, a joyous life is that which receives everything  as a gift and a self-absorbed and therefore miserable life is that which looks at everything  I'm owed this, I'm owed this, I'm owed this. Now, Nebuchadnezzar becomes an animal. We understand what happened, we understand now that he went insane, it was a physiological  thing, it was a brain chemistry thing, we know something about this. He thought he was an animal, he began to live as an animal for seven times, which probably  means seven months or maybe seven seasons, which would have been a year and a half or  so. But for a period of time, he thought he was an animal.

And we say, oh, this is one of those disasters that comes upon us, you know, mental illness,  it's not, it wasn't his fault and it wasn't, but it was a lesson. You know what it teaches us? God is showing us that pride defaces your humanity. God was saying to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar, listen to me. Because you insisted on trying to become more than what I made you, you will become less  than what I made.

Because you aspire to be more than a man, you become less than a man. And this isn't just an arbitrary action on God's part. He's trying to show Nebuchadnezzar what pride does to you anyway. I mean, when a child of mine lies to me, what do we do? Oh, good parents know that the discipline should be natural consequences.

You say, honey, if you grew up to be a liar, you're going to have no friends, you're  going to be isolated, you're going to be in jail, your life will be a mess. Therefore, since we cannot trust you, because you lied, you can't go outside for a week,  you can't go play with your friends, you can't go out, because we can't trust what  you say. And he says, I've got to save you from the eternal consequences of what's happening to you. Pride where you aspire to be more than a man makes you less than a man. It's turning you into an animal.

I've got to really turn you into an animal to show you what's happening to you. And you say, well, how does pride turn you into an animal? It's fairly simple, but look, listen, number one, how does this work? Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize with people. And I live with an animal, it's a cat, and you know, cats sometimes look like they're  sympathetic.

You know, they come and nuzzle you when you're feeling bad, you think, oh, and then  you realize she's hungry. Cats, animals have no imagination, and because they have no imagination, there's no art. And therefore there's no empathy. Animals cannot imagine what other people are going through. Animals cannot, as the Bible says, weak with those who weep and rejoice with those who  rejoice.

Can't do it. And pride is a cancer that eats that up in you too. You see, there's nothing, you're never more human than when you're compassionate. You're never more human than when you're able to sense what somebody else feels. But what is pride?

Pride is a way of justifying to yourself the control you have over your life. The only way to justify that is to be constantly saying, I deserve this, I'm owed this. And it's pride that makes you walk into a room, and I see this happen all the time. You come to a new church, maybe you're coming to a new church. You look around and you say, are these the kind of people I want to be with?

Are these the kind of people that I feel like will understand me? Are these the kind of people that will sympathize with me? Are these the kind of people that will enhance my sense of who I want to see myself as? That's eating up your humanity. Pride makes you only think, are they weeping with me?

Are they rejoicing with me? Pride makes you so miserable because you're so absorbed in yourself. That you cannot even notice people weeping over in this corner, and you can't even notice  people over in this corner. Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize, and we give you another one. Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego-survival instincts.

There's a great place in C.S. Lewis's book on Pride in which he says, in Mayor Christianity,  he's got a great place, a chapter on Pride in which he says this,  Pride makes the heart want to keep well away from anything better or stronger or higher than it. Anything that might make it feel small or that shows it,  it doesn't have the right to be the center of the universe it wishes to be. You know what he's saying? It's pride that makes you threatened.

It's pride and only pride that whatever makes you unhappy when you're in a situation  where somebody makes you feel less attractive, somebody makes you feel less intelligent,  somebody makes you feel less sharp, you get threatened. Only pride can do that. It's that which makes you compare yourself to other people. Only pride makes you hate situations in which you've got to admit vulnerability,  you've got to admit weakness, you've got to admit I need some help. You've got to admit I'm powerless over my problems.

We hate it. We won't admit it. And therefore, like a scared animal, we run from things that threaten us. We run from people that threaten us. You're ever threatened by somebody.

If you ever, S.Y.C.S. Lewis at one point says, you know why? You know who hates bragging people the most? You have to be very proud to hate proud people. You have to be very proud because people who hog the center stage,  the reason they hate you, that you hate them so much is because you feel like  I deserve that center stage more than he or she.

Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego survival instincts. Maybe last of all, pride like an animal makes you incapable of joy. You say, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now you're being unfair. All along, I've been upset about this.

I'm kind of an animal lover. Animals can be happy. Don't tell me animals can't be happy. Haven't you ever heard of cat purr? And the answer is, well, yeah, a cat can be satisfied,  but a cat can't have joy.

A cat, an animal can only be happy under the right circumstances. Animals cannot rejoice in their tribulations. Animals can never rise above their circumstances. Animals never have anything, don't you see? They never have anything that enables them to have joy  in spite of what's going on around them.

Pride sucks all joy out of your life. You know why? Here's how it does it. If things go well, you say, well, of course, it's about time. You don't say, oh, it's about time.

This should happen five years ago. Don't you see what pride does? Everything is owed. I deserve this. See?

And if things go really badly, you're so bitter, you say,  this isn't fair. Pride destroys your ability to handle bad times,  and it sucks the goodness and joy out of good times. There's only one way, then, to be healed. And Nebuchadnezzar finds it. You know how it is?

How it happens? The only way for it to be healed is God has to do it. There's a great story in CS Lewis's Narnia tales about Eustace. He's a proud little boy. And in this particular fairy tale,  he falls asleep with greedy thoughts on the hoard of a dragon.

And he wakes up and he's been turned into a dragon. And you know, he tries to get rid of his dragon skin by pulling it off,  but he finds that he's still a dragon underneath. And he finally has to go to the Christ figure to Aslan and say,  and here's the Aslan say, I'll have to address you. And he has to let Aslan do it. And of course, Aslan the lion.

Aslan takes his paws and he rips. And Eustace says, I thought it was going to kill me. I thought it would go right to my heart. What Lewis is trying to show us is most of us realize  that so much of our problem comes from pride. We all sent, why is it that you toss and turn at night  because you've been snubbed?

Well, don't you hate the self-concentration? Don't you hate the, don't you hate always thinking about yourself? Don't you hate the absorption? It's misery. And so you try to change it with an act of the will.

I'm not going to think so much about myself. You can't do it. You have to let him undress you. And the only thing that will undress you  and that will heal your pride is you have to see two things together. You have to see that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment.

You have to see that your cosmic plagiarism. You have to see that you're taking your life  and assuming you're the author one, actually,  you owe everything to him. It's terrible sin. And that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment. And yet, at the same time,  you've got to see that you are the object  of the greatest mercy of God.

At together, you have to see them both. If you don't see them both. If you only see one and not the other, you won't be healed. But if you see them both, and that's what happens to Nebuchadnezzar. You notice, first of all, Nebuchadnezzar says,  look, he confesses all the peoples are nothing.

All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He's talking about himself. He gets up and he says, I've learned when bad things happened to you,  when the stroke comes in, it almost seems to go to your heart. You can either receive it in pride  and say, I don't deserve this difficulty  or else you can do what Nebuchadnezzar did. And that is, Nebuchadnezzar realized, I deserve this.

This shows me my fragility. This shows me who I am. And he lets the stroke humble him instead of harden him. That's the first thing. Then the second thing, he recognizes  that all the things that before he thought were his by right,  they've come back to him and he sees them all as a gift.

You see his attitude, they were restored. My counselor still wanted to speak to me after all of that. See, now he sees everything as a gift  because God only cut down the tree to the stump. He didn't uproot the stump. He showed mercy on Nebuchadnezzar.

How could he show mercy on Nebuchadnezzar? How could he forgive Nebuchadnezzar for all that? How could he do it? Well, Nebuchadnezzar didn't know, but you and I know. And you know why?

Nebuchadnezzar was not master of the universe,  but he took it as if he was. Jesus Christ was the only one who ever stood on the face of the earth  who was the master of the universe and he let it all go. You know why? Isaiah 52 is a prophecy about the great coming servant,  the Messiah, and it says,  my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted,  but they will be terrified at him.

His appearance was disfigured beyond human likeness  so that he shall sprinkle clean many nations  and kings will shut their mouths because of him. Jesus Christ came and was so beaten and gourd  and he was so slashed and gashed and so pierced  that people who looked upon him were terrified  because he didn't look human. You know why he did that? The sprinkler was clean to take our sins. You know why he did that?

Because in our pride,  we try to be more than mere humans and we act like God. Therefore, Jesus Christ had to become less than he was. He had to become even beyond,  he was more beyond human likeness  so that we could become all that he was. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteous of God and him. If you're healed of this pride,  Daniel tells you what you're going to be like.

First of all, you're going to look up to heaven  like Nebuchadnezzar and you're going to say,  you are right in everything you do. You know why that terribly interesting  and seductive book sold so much  why bad things happen to good people? You know why people have so much trouble  with the suffering of this world? There's an assumption. And I want you to prove it to me.

The assumption is the world is worse than we deserve. Oh, really, prove that to me. That's the reason why people look at life  and have so much trouble with it. When you're a Christian,  you realize the world is much better than we deserve. And therefore, though you leap over pain,  you leap over troubles,  you leap over tragedies,  but you look to heaven.

And this is an asset test  of whether you've been healed  or you're prior to the gospel. You look to heaven and you say,  everything you do is right. Your ability to handle suffering will depend on  whether you believe this world is worse than we deserve  or whether you think it's better we deserve  and that will completely depend on  what you believe about the gospel. But secondly, Daniel says,  remember when he says that to Nebuchadnezzar,  please turn away and humble yourself  so that these bad things don't come upon you. You know what he says?

You see what he tells me to do? He says, remember the oppressed,  remember the poor. Here's what he means. The asset test to know,  whether you've been humbled in your pride,  is what you do with your money. You know, you may say,  oh, yes, I believe everything is from God.

It's all a gift,  but here's the asset test. Are you generous with your money? Or do you act as if it's all yours? You earned it. Imagine people over the years have told me  the idea, the biblical idea of tithing,  of giving away 10% to the poor,  to the church, the charity is unreasonable.

What if you turn to somebody and said,  I'm in trouble, I need alone. And that person says, how much? You say $10,000. I'll pay it all back. The person says, I'll tell you what,  here's a $10,000.

And all I went back is $1,000. The rest is a gift. What would you say? How unreasonable, unbelievable  that you would want $1,000 back on this loan? Incredible.

Who do you think I am? No, you'd say unbelievable grace. But God looks at you and says,  give away 10% of your money to the people around you. And you say it's unreasonable. That proves that in your heart,  you still believe you're your own author.

That proves that you haven't really seen yourself  as a sinner saved by grace,  so that everything, everything, everything's a gift. The irony is that unless you break yourself  so that second kind of pride, you'll never see yourself. You'll never get the first kind of pride. Remember the pride that Esok Denison talked about? Until you see that you are not in charge of your life,  that you're not your own author,  you will never see that he is your author.

And therefore you are a work of art. Are you an accident? Are you a self-made person? Fine. Then you're free.

You can live life the way you want. But you're just an accident. Do you believe what God says? That I created you? I am your author.

Well, in that case you're not in control of your life. But now you're a work of art. And you know how artists feel about their art. They love their art. They labor over their art.

They sweat blood over the art. They cherish their art. They love their art and that's how God looks at you. How will you know? You are ravishingly beautiful to God.

How will you have that kind of poison and that kind of stability  that comes from knowing God loves me and values me? How will you know that? Only by losing control and saying, you are the author. Which way are you going to live? He is able to humble those who are proud.

Let's pray. Father, as we go to your table,  we pray that you would give us the look at our sin  and the look at your mercy that will heal us of our pride. Many of us right now are experiencing the kind of difficulties  that come from being full of self-absorption,  comparing ourselves to others,  having our feelings hurt. Oh Lord, help us to see all life as a gift. Help us to see even our troubles as part of your mercy.

Help us to see our material possessions  as all part of your gift to us. Help us to have the kind of easy joy,  generous spirit, incredible confidence  that comes from knowing that we don't belong to ourselves,  but we are a work of art, the creator of the universe. Help us to understand that as we pick up the bread and the cup. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

### English Transcript (for reference)

Welcome to Gospel in Life. Why is the world so broken? And why are we capable of inflicting such harm even toward those we love? People point to politics, poverty, or psychology, but none of these fully explain what we see in  ourselves and in history. This month on the podcast, Tim Keller is teaching from a series exploring the question,  what's wrong with us?

Knowing us how the Bible's teaching unsin offers the only explanation deep enough to face  the truth in all its complexity, and the only hope powerfully enough to transform us. Let me read you the story of Nebuchadnezzar, which you actually just listened to. This found in Daniel chapter 4, it really starts at the very beginning of the chapter. And in the beginning of the chapter, Daniel is called in by Nebuchadnezzar, the great king  of Babylon, to interpret a dream for him. And we'll get into that and describe that dream, but we take this up, our reading at verse  24, and this is Daniel speaking.

This is the interpretation of King. And this is the decree the most high has issued against my Lord the King. You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals. You will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of the heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign  over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he pleases.

The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will  be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules. Before O King, be pleased to accept my advice, renounce your sins by doing what is right  and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed, it may be that then your prosperity  will continue. All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,  he said, is not this the great Babylon. I have built as the royal residence by my mighty power.

Only for the glory of my majesty. The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven. This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar. Your royal authority has been taken from you. You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals.

You will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms  of men and gives them to anyone he wishes. Finally, what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with a dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle  and his nails like the claws of a bird.

And at the end of that time, I Nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my sanity  was restored. Then I praised the most high. I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion. His kingdom endures from generation to generation.

All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him, what have you done? At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendour were returned to me for  the glory of my kingdom. My advisors and nobles sought me out and I was restored to my throne and became even greater  than before.

Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the king of heaven because everything  he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride, he is able to humble. This is God's Word. Now, the only thing funny about Nebuchadnezzar's name, in the 6th century BC, he was the absolute  monarch of the kingdom of the empire of Babylonia. Now, what did that mean?

You know, Tom Wolfe and Bonfire of the Vanities coined a phrase, Masters of the Universe. And these, of course, were a name that he put in the mind of some big Wall Street guy  who felt he was on top of the world because he made seven figures. And Tom Wolfe said in his heart, he thought of himself as part of that elite little group  of people, Masters of the Universe, by my mighty power, for the glory of my majesty. I have really gotten on top of the world. But you know, here it's a real master of the universe, not just somebody who lives, you  know, around the corner here.

They were the absolute monarchs of every part of the world they knew of. Every part of the world that he knew or his civilization knew anything about, he was  the absolute monarch of. And so, he built the, maybe the most incredible city in history. He built Babylon as his personal residence. And proportionately, to the rest of the world, it was much bigger than New York City  as now.

And he had had something else. Imagine New York, all of its power, all of its diversity, and green. Because what Nebuchadnezzar did, and you can, one of the seven wonders of the ancient  world, the hanging gardens of Nebuchadnezzar, what he did at Babylon was he made skyscrapers  of the kind they were able to do then. He created this incredible city and it was like a park. The hanging gardens of Babylon.

And yet, though here's somebody at the pinnacle of power, maybe a kind of power that only  a half dozen people in all of history have ever known. His life falls apart anyway. And when it's done, here's the incredible part. He's glad it happened. He's glad.

He praises God for having done it. You know why? Because he says there was a spiritual cancer in me. There was something in me that was so bad. It was so dangerous that it poisoned my soul so deeply that even as drastic as the treatment  was, it was worth it to get it out of my soul.

What is it? Pride. Spiritual pride. And I think there's no place in the maybe the world where it's more important to talk  about this particular guy. In this particular case, because you know, people come to New York with dreams.

Dreams. You come to New York because you're good at something and you come to New York with dreams  of becoming maybe the best at something. And therefore it is maybe no more important place to ask these questions. Could it be that our own minds are as clouded as his was? Could it be, as we're going to see, that our own sleep is being troubled by the same causes  as his was?

Could it be that your life is falling apart right now or your life is about to fall apart  right now for the same reason that his did, for the same lesson that he learned. And if anybody here says, well, I'm not capable of spiritual pride, you should know that in  a biblical diagnostic manual, that's the first sign of it to say something. Let's take a look. What is this teacher's, that's a dirty trick, is it? That anyway, but that's what the Bible teaches.

Listen, this text tells us about pride, four things. It tells us about the sleep of pride, the heart of pride, the outcome of pride and the healing  of pride. Sleep the heart, the outcome of the healing, go through. Sleep. See, you notice it says here 12 months later, you see this?

It says 12 months later. Now what happened 12 months before? If you read the very beginning of the passage, it goes like this, here is one guy you'd think  in the world that would not have any worries, that there'd be nothing to disturb his sleep,  there'd be nothing to disturb him. Here's the one guy in the world that can't ever worry about being fired. See, you know, nobody will ever downsize, you see.

Here's also, you have to say, ah, yes, but he's always worried some army, what army? He's the absolute monarch, nobody else has an army. And he says in verse four, early on in the chapter, we didn't read it, in verse four,  he says, I, Nebuchadnezzar, was in my palace, content and prosperous. And I fell asleep and I was terrified by a dream, content and prosperous, but I was terrified  by a dream. And the dream, in the dream, he saw a tree that reached to the heavens, and it was so  cosmically large that everything in the earth was under the tree.

All the creatures of heaven, everything in the whole world, sheltered under the tree. And it was magnificent, but suddenly in the dream of voice from heaven comes and says,  cut down the tree, strip off its leaves, scatter its fruit, and let the dew of heaven lie upon  the stump for seven times. And what's the purpose of all this? The voice says, and I quote, that the living may know that the most high is sovereign over  kingdoms of the earth, and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the loliest  of men. Well, he's very upset, of course, so Nebuchadnezzar calls Daniel a man of God and says,  Daniel, let me tell you the dream, tell me what it means.

And Daniel, the man of God, when he heard the dream, were told he went white, he blanched,  he was terrified, and he says, and these are his words in verse 22, you, O King, are that  tree? And God is coming to humble you, God is coming to cut you down, God is coming to show  you that you are not a master of the universe, but that you are weak and you are loley and  you live only by his will. So look it, and you see Daniel speaking at the top of this text that we read, he says,  God is coming, he's coming to humble you, and he's concerning, he says, therefore, be  pleased to listen to me. Change, turn, repent, humble yourself, and maybe this won't happen to you. But we're told that 12 months later, something did happen.

But what do we learn here? I'll tell you what we learned before we move on to really talking about the heart of pride. What does this teach us? It teaches us this. No matter how accomplished you think you are, or will be, no matter how successful you  think you are, or will be, contentment and prosperity, the two words that Nebuchadnezzar  used, he says, I was content, I was prosperous, I was Lord of all that I surveyed, but I couldn't  sleep.

No matter how content, no matter how prosperous you think you can get, it's never complete,  never. Nebuchadnezzar knew what only a few people in the world know to really know this, to really  know this, you've got to get to the top, and very, very few of us ever will. I was reading, I was watching an A&E biography on Howard Hughes. Biographies, newspapers, personal acquaintance tells us that the people at the top, top,  the Nebuchadnezzars of life are deeply troubled people. Why?

Because they come to learn what the rest of us deny, and that is that human soul wants  something that is so big, that you can pour all the empires of the world into that  whole, into that heart, you can pour all the empires of the world into your soul and  it not be satisfied. What then is it that we're really after? See only the Nebuchadnezzars of the world really understand this. That's why they're despair, because they can't get content, and they can't get prosperous,  they can't sleep. There's something wrong, there's something missing.

What could it be that you could pour the entire world into? And the Howard Hugheses and the Nebuchadnezzars and the people like that are deeply troubled,  they know what we don't know. The human soul wants something bigger than the world, but what could that be? They didn't know that once, two thousand years ago, there was a little stable that contained  something in it bigger than the world. And at any heart, the simplest, the filthiest, the feeblest, can also have in it something  bigger than the world that really satisfies.

Therefore, no matter how you see pride cannot bring sleep, success, achievement, a sense  of being master of your universe, you aspire to it. Most of us from all of our life trying to get there saying if we could finally get there,  but the ones who have gotten there, they can't sleep. The sleep of pride, okay, secondly, the harder pride. And by the way, another thing we learn from this is that because God's a merciful God and  He sees the terrible outcome of pride, which we're going to look at here in a second, He  will send you voices, He will send you dreams, and He will send you Daniels if only you recognize  them for what they are. What are they?

They're things that are here to tell you you're not in charge. You think you're in charge or you want to be in charge of your life, but you're not. Maybe a Daniel brought you to church today. I hope you recognize these voices and these Daniels and these dreams for what they are,  the merciful messengers of God. Anyway, Nebuchadnezzar doesn't listen.

Twelve months later, he gets up and he says, is not this the great Babylon that I have made  as my royal residence and I have made it by my mighty power and for the glory of my  majesty. That is pride. You want to see what pride is? When he talks about God humbling the proud, he's not talking, there's a kind of pride, there's  a kind of thing we call pride that's good. There's a kind of thing we call pride that's good.

And of course, one of my favorite quotes in all of my life that I've ever read is that  one that describes it. It's by Esok Denison of all people who said pride is faith in the idea that God had when  he made you. And what she means there, see what the Bible teaches is that you are not an accident. God created you. He created with a dignity and with purpose.

He created you with design. And when a human being comes to understand that and grasp what the Bible says, when you  rejoice in it and when you are ravished with that and when you reflect on that, it creates  a stability in you. It creates a joy in you. It creates a kind of confidence in you. That can be called pride, but that's not the kind of pride that Devakita is talking about  here.

When he says, he is able to humble the proud. What he's talking about is this, pride, spiritual pride is that which says, looks at life and  looks at all the things in life and says, I did it and I'm doing it. I did it. By my mighty power, I'm do it for the glory of my majesty. Life is by me and for me.

Let me break that down. Pride, first of all, is that which looks at the good things in your life and says, that's  by me. I did it. I accomplished it. If things go well in your life, you look at that and you say, ask because I worked harder.

Reason I'm doing better than other people is because I've worked harder than other people. Or I worked smarter than other people or I worked more, or ethically than other people  or whatever you say, that's by me. I did it. Therefore, secondly, pride looks at life and the good things at life and says, therefore,  I deserve. Pride looks at life with a very deep sense of owedness.

Pride makes us look at life and say, I am owed these good things. Now, I'll tell you something. Pride has many forms and you've got to be careful. Pride works in a good life or a hard life. Here's how pride works when your life is going well.

You say, I'm getting these good things. I'm doing better than other people because I'm working better than other people. I'm working smarter than other people or harder. You say, and you say, therefore, I'm owed this. When your life is going badly, when things aren't working out, what do you do?

You look at life and you say, I'm suffering more than other people. Things aren't fair. I'm having a harder life than other people. Therefore, I'm owed this. It's the same thing.

Whether your life's going well or whether your life's going poor, poorly,  what it means to be proud is the spiritual pride makes you look at life and say,  I deserve more than I'm getting. Spiritual pride makes you look at life where the things are going well or not and you say,  I should be getting more than I have. I'm owed every bit of this and I'm owed more than what I've got. Now the contrast is humility in the Bible and humility is very different. Pride, let me give you a definition.

Pride is that which claims to be the author of what is really a gift. Pride is what makes you look at your life and say, on the author of it, it's a sheer  gift. Pride is a form of cosmic plagiarism. Something else has been brought into your life. Something's been given to you and you say, I wrote it, I composed it, I did it.

You claim to be the author of that, which is a sheer gift. Community is a completely different approach. Humility looks at life like this, it's a gift. Humility looks at everything. I don't deserve this.

If God gave me what I deserve, I'd be lost, but look at this and this and this, all  these things. It's all gravy. It's all a gift. Now somebody says, oh, that's terrible. You mean you go around a humble person, you're saying a Christian person is humble and you  go around thinking you don't deserve anything?

Boy, that's terrible. That's low self esteem. That's awful. You're saying, I don't deserve everything. That would make you hate life.

No, listen, you're failing to make a distinction. Humility is that which receives life as a gift. There's a kind of false humility that says, I don't deserve this, so I don't want it. I don't deserve this, so I don't want it. I'm too awful.

I'm a failure. I'm a bad person, so I don't want this and this and I don't want friends. I don't want joy. I don't want these things. That's just a reverse kind of pride, you see.

What that is saying is I should earn it. I want to earn it and I won't take it if I haven't earned it and of course you're miserable  and of course you're saying I don't deserve it but deep underneath it is still that sense  of odeness. Real humility says, I don't deserve the good things in my life because if God gave me what  I deserved, I'd be lost but look here they come. See humility has completely gotten rid of the whole concept of pride, the whole system  of pride. Humility says, I couldn't possibly even begin to merit the good things that God's giving  me my health, my mind, my friends.

What I do have, it's all mercy and you say, look at this and therefore everything you  enjoy every day is like this urge. Every day is a surprise. That's what a gift is, a good gift you're surprised, it's better than you thought. You didn't know it was coming. It's absolutely free.

It's undeserved. And you look at everything that way. Everywhere we look we see brokenness, wars, cruelty and heartache. We feel it in the world around us and in our own lives. How did it get this way and what can be done about it?

In his brand new book that's releasing this month, what is wrong with the world? Tim Keller offers a clear and compassionate answer. Drawing from a series of teachings given at Redeemer, Dr. Keller shows how the reality  of sin explains the pain we see all around us and how only the gospel offers lasting freedom  and healing. Whether you're overwhelmed by the state of our world struggling with your own mistakes  or choices or looking for hope and joy, what is wrong with the world will help you see  how the gospel speaks to both the heartache of our world and the pain within each of us.

This newly released book What Is Wrong with the World is our thanks for your gift this  month to help gospel in life share the good news of Jesus. That's your copy today at gospelonlife.com slash give. That's gospelonlife.com slash give. Now here's Dr. Keller with the rest of today's teaching.

Now what's so bad about pride? Somebody says, what's so bad about pride? I mean, Nebuchadnezzar looked around and said, didn't I earn this and didn't he? Do you know he was really the greatest military genius of his era? You know he risked his life every time I went into battle.

He can beat all those people single handedly. He wasn't an arm short general in just push buttons. He got in the chair he went out front. He was maybe one of the greatest political leaders in history, didn't he do it? What's so bad about saying that and here's what's so bad in, listen, John wrote, where are  you John?

John wrote, he composed that piece. What if I stole it? What if I put my name on it? If I took it to somebody and said, here, I wrote this and they say, incredible. Not only are you a preacher, you're a wonderful musician.

You're an incredible composer, whoever heard of such a multi gifted person. What have I done? Why would John have the right to be absolutely outraged? Why would you be outraged if you found out about it? Why would you never come back if you found out about it?

Why? Because you would say you've robbed him of his due and you've rested control of his art  from him. Because you see the author owns the work. The author has control over the work and the Bible tells us why we've got pride. Why we don't want to admit that everything in our life is a gift, that nothing we've  got we deserve, that we are dependent on God for every breath, because you see if you  admit that he's the author, if you admit that you are totally dependent on God, then  you have lost control.

And we don't want that. Remember, Dorothy Sayers says, sin is a deep interior dislocation of the soul. It's a desire to keep control of the life and the only way to justify the control of the  life that you have. You have to blind yourself to how dependent you are on him. You say, I don't have control of my life, I'm a religious person, my friends, listen.

This is how the human heart works, even if you're religious. You say, I'll take into consideration, religious tradition, I'll take into consideration, but  I am the final one who determines what I do with my body. I am the final one who determines what I do with my tongue, with my mind, with my money,  me. I have to decide whether it's practical to obey the Bible. If you ever, ever think like that, you're still in charge.

And the only way to justify that is to say, I'm not utterly dependent. I've earned. Here's never can listen, friends, you're so self-made. How much of what you are is really under your control. You did not choose your race, you did not choose your gender, you didn't choose the century  and you which you were born.

You don't think you had nothing to do with the fact that you were born here and now, instead  of in 14th century Europe during the bubonic plague, you don't think that that has a little  impact on what you are today. You say, I've worked hard with what, with the mind, with the talents, with the abilities,  with the friendships, with the connections that God and God alone gave you. You didn't choose your parents, you didn't choose your sibling, you didn't choose any  of your early childhood experiences, all of which we all say are so formative. You didn't choose your basic abilities and talents and the level of those abilities. God says, what, you want to know what humility is?

You want to know what pride is? Paul says, and for as Corinthians 4, 6 and 7, you will not. You will not take pride in one man over another, for what differentiates you from any other,  what do you have that you did not receive as a gift? You will not take pride in one over another, for what makes you different? What do you have that you didn't receive as a gift?

And the Bible says, that's what humility is, a joyous life is that which receives everything  as a gift and a self-absorbed and therefore miserable life is that which looks at everything  I'm owed this, I'm owed this, I'm owed this. Now, Nebuchadnezzar becomes an animal. We understand what happened, we understand now that he went insane, it was a physiological  thing, it was a brain chemistry thing, we know something about this. He thought he was an animal, he began to live as an animal for seven times, which probably  means seven months or maybe seven seasons, which would have been a year and a half or  so. But for a period of time, he thought he was an animal.

And we say, oh, this is one of those disasters that comes upon us, you know, mental illness,  it's not, it wasn't his fault and it wasn't, but it was a lesson. You know what it teaches us? God is showing us that pride defaces your humanity. God was saying to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar, listen to me. Because you insisted on trying to become more than what I made you, you will become less  than what I made.

Because you aspire to be more than a man, you become less than a man. And this isn't just an arbitrary action on God's part. He's trying to show Nebuchadnezzar what pride does to you anyway. I mean, when a child of mine lies to me, what do we do? Oh, good parents know that the discipline should be natural consequences.

You say, honey, if you grew up to be a liar, you're going to have no friends, you're  going to be isolated, you're going to be in jail, your life will be a mess. Therefore, since we cannot trust you, because you lied, you can't go outside for a week,  you can't go play with your friends, you can't go out, because we can't trust what  you say. And he says, I've got to save you from the eternal consequences of what's happening to you. Pride where you aspire to be more than a man makes you less than a man. It's turning you into an animal.

I've got to really turn you into an animal to show you what's happening to you. And you say, well, how does pride turn you into an animal? It's fairly simple, but look, listen, number one, how does this work? Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize with people. And I live with an animal, it's a cat, and you know, cats sometimes look like they're  sympathetic.

You know, they come and nuzzle you when you're feeling bad, you think, oh, and then  you realize she's hungry. Cats, animals have no imagination, and because they have no imagination, there's no art. And therefore there's no empathy. Animals cannot imagine what other people are going through. Animals cannot, as the Bible says, weak with those who weep and rejoice with those who  rejoice.

Can't do it. And pride is a cancer that eats that up in you too. You see, there's nothing, you're never more human than when you're compassionate. You're never more human than when you're able to sense what somebody else feels. But what is pride?

Pride is a way of justifying to yourself the control you have over your life. The only way to justify that is to be constantly saying, I deserve this, I'm owed this. And it's pride that makes you walk into a room, and I see this happen all the time. You come to a new church, maybe you're coming to a new church. You look around and you say, are these the kind of people I want to be with?

Are these the kind of people that I feel like will understand me? Are these the kind of people that will sympathize with me? Are these the kind of people that will enhance my sense of who I want to see myself as? That's eating up your humanity. Pride makes you only think, are they weeping with me?

Are they rejoicing with me? Pride makes you so miserable because you're so absorbed in yourself. That you cannot even notice people weeping over in this corner, and you can't even notice  people over in this corner. Pride makes you like an animal unable to empathize, and we give you another one. Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego-survival instincts.

There's a great place in C.S. Lewis's book on Pride in which he says, in Mayor Christianity,  he's got a great place, a chapter on Pride in which he says this,  Pride makes the heart want to keep well away from anything better or stronger or higher than it. Anything that might make it feel small or that shows it,  it doesn't have the right to be the center of the universe it wishes to be. You know what he's saying? It's pride that makes you threatened.

It's pride and only pride that whatever makes you unhappy when you're in a situation  where somebody makes you feel less attractive, somebody makes you feel less intelligent,  somebody makes you feel less sharp, you get threatened. Only pride can do that. It's that which makes you compare yourself to other people. Only pride makes you hate situations in which you've got to admit vulnerability,  you've got to admit weakness, you've got to admit I need some help. You've got to admit I'm powerless over my problems.

We hate it. We won't admit it. And therefore, like a scared animal, we run from things that threaten us. We run from people that threaten us. You're ever threatened by somebody.

If you ever, S.Y.C.S. Lewis at one point says, you know why? You know who hates bragging people the most? You have to be very proud to hate proud people. You have to be very proud because people who hog the center stage,  the reason they hate you, that you hate them so much is because you feel like  I deserve that center stage more than he or she.

Pride makes you like an animal driven by ego survival instincts. Maybe last of all, pride like an animal makes you incapable of joy. You say, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now you're being unfair. All along, I've been upset about this.

I'm kind of an animal lover. Animals can be happy. Don't tell me animals can't be happy. Haven't you ever heard of cat purr? And the answer is, well, yeah, a cat can be satisfied,  but a cat can't have joy.

A cat, an animal can only be happy under the right circumstances. Animals cannot rejoice in their tribulations. Animals can never rise above their circumstances. Animals never have anything, don't you see? They never have anything that enables them to have joy  in spite of what's going on around them.

Pride sucks all joy out of your life. You know why? Here's how it does it. If things go well, you say, well, of course, it's about time. You don't say, oh, it's about time.

This should happen five years ago. Don't you see what pride does? Everything is owed. I deserve this. See?

And if things go really badly, you're so bitter, you say,  this isn't fair. Pride destroys your ability to handle bad times,  and it sucks the goodness and joy out of good times. There's only one way, then, to be healed. And Nebuchadnezzar finds it. You know how it is?

How it happens? The only way for it to be healed is God has to do it. There's a great story in CS Lewis's Narnia tales about Eustace. He's a proud little boy. And in this particular fairy tale,  he falls asleep with greedy thoughts on the hoard of a dragon.

And he wakes up and he's been turned into a dragon. And you know, he tries to get rid of his dragon skin by pulling it off,  but he finds that he's still a dragon underneath. And he finally has to go to the Christ figure to Aslan and say,  and here's the Aslan say, I'll have to address you. And he has to let Aslan do it. And of course, Aslan the lion.

Aslan takes his paws and he rips. And Eustace says, I thought it was going to kill me. I thought it would go right to my heart. What Lewis is trying to show us is most of us realize  that so much of our problem comes from pride. We all sent, why is it that you toss and turn at night  because you've been snubbed?

Well, don't you hate the self-concentration? Don't you hate the, don't you hate always thinking about yourself? Don't you hate the absorption? It's misery. And so you try to change it with an act of the will.

I'm not going to think so much about myself. You can't do it. You have to let him undress you. And the only thing that will undress you  and that will heal your pride is you have to see two things together. You have to see that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment.

You have to see that your cosmic plagiarism. You have to see that you're taking your life  and assuming you're the author one, actually,  you owe everything to him. It's terrible sin. And that you don't deserve anything from God but judgment. And yet, at the same time,  you've got to see that you are the object  of the greatest mercy of God.

At together, you have to see them both. If you don't see them both. If you only see one and not the other, you won't be healed. But if you see them both, and that's what happens to Nebuchadnezzar. You notice, first of all, Nebuchadnezzar says,  look, he confesses all the peoples are nothing.

All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He's talking about himself. He gets up and he says, I've learned when bad things happened to you,  when the stroke comes in, it almost seems to go to your heart. You can either receive it in pride  and say, I don't deserve this difficulty  or else you can do what Nebuchadnezzar did. And that is, Nebuchadnezzar realized, I deserve this.

This shows me my fragility. This shows me who I am. And he lets the stroke humble him instead of harden him. That's the first thing. Then the second thing, he recognizes  that all the things that before he thought were his by right,  they've come back to him and he sees them all as a gift.

You see his attitude, they were restored. My counselor still wanted to speak to me after all of that. See, now he sees everything as a gift  because God only cut down the tree to the stump. He didn't uproot the stump. He showed mercy on Nebuchadnezzar.

How could he show mercy on Nebuchadnezzar? How could he forgive Nebuchadnezzar for all that? How could he do it? Well, Nebuchadnezzar didn't know, but you and I know. And you know why?

Nebuchadnezzar was not master of the universe,  but he took it as if he was. Jesus Christ was the only one who ever stood on the face of the earth  who was the master of the universe and he let it all go. You know why? Isaiah 52 is a prophecy about the great coming servant,  the Messiah, and it says,  my servant will act wisely. He will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted,  but they will be terrified at him.

His appearance was disfigured beyond human likeness  so that he shall sprinkle clean many nations  and kings will shut their mouths because of him. Jesus Christ came and was so beaten and gourd  and he was so slashed and gashed and so pierced  that people who looked upon him were terrified  because he didn't look human. You know why he did that? The sprinkler was clean to take our sins. You know why he did that?

Because in our pride,  we try to be more than mere humans and we act like God. Therefore, Jesus Christ had to become less than he was. He had to become even beyond,  he was more beyond human likeness  so that we could become all that he was. God made him sin, who knew no sin,  that we might become the righteous of God and him. If you're healed of this pride,  Daniel tells you what you're going to be like.

First of all, you're going to look up to heaven  like Nebuchadnezzar and you're going to say,  you are right in everything you do. You know why that terribly interesting  and seductive book sold so much  why bad things happen to good people? You know why people have so much trouble  with the suffering of this world? There's an assumption. And I want you to prove it to me.

The assumption is the world is worse than we deserve. Oh, really, prove that to me. That's the reason why people look at life  and have so much trouble with it. When you're a Christian,  you realize the world is much better than we deserve. And therefore, though you leap over pain,  you leap over troubles,  you leap over tragedies,  but you look to heaven.

And this is an asset test  of whether you've been healed  or you're prior to the gospel. You look to heaven and you say,  everything you do is right. Your ability to handle suffering will depend on  whether you believe this world is worse than we deserve  or whether you think it's better we deserve  and that will completely depend on  what you believe about the gospel. But secondly, Daniel says,  remember when he says that to Nebuchadnezzar,  please turn away and humble yourself  so that these bad things don't come upon you. You know what he says?

You see what he tells me to do? He says, remember the oppressed,  remember the poor. Here's what he means. The asset test to know,  whether you've been humbled in your pride,  is what you do with your money. You know, you may say,  oh, yes, I believe everything is from God.

It's all a gift,  but here's the asset test. Are you generous with your money? Or do you act as if it's all yours? You earned it. Imagine people over the years have told me  the idea, the biblical idea of tithing,  of giving away 10% to the poor,  to the church, the charity is unreasonable.

What if you turn to somebody and said,  I'm in trouble, I need alone. And that person says, how much? You say $10,000. I'll pay it all back. The person says, I'll tell you what,  here's a $10,000.

And all I went back is $1,000. The rest is a gift. What would you say? How unreasonable, unbelievable  that you would want $1,000 back on this loan? Incredible.

Who do you think I am? No, you'd say unbelievable grace. But God looks at you and says,  give away 10% of your money to the people around you. And you say it's unreasonable. That proves that in your heart,  you still believe you're your own author.

That proves that you haven't really seen yourself  as a sinner saved by grace,  so that everything, everything, everything's a gift. The irony is that unless you break yourself  so that second kind of pride, you'll never see yourself. You'll never get the first kind of pride. Remember the pride that Esok Denison talked about? Until you see that you are not in charge of your life,  that you're not your own author,  you will never see that he is your author.

And therefore you are a work of art. Are you an accident? Are you a self-made person? Fine. Then you're free.

You can live life the way you want. But you're just an accident. Do you believe what God says? That I created you? I am your author.

Well, in that case you're not in control of your life. But now you're a work of art. And you know how artists feel about their art. They love their art. They labor over their art.

They sweat blood over the art. They cherish their art. They love their art and that's how God looks at you. How will you know? You are ravishingly beautiful to God.

How will you have that kind of poison and that kind of stability  that comes from knowing God loves me and values me? How will you know that? Only by losing control and saying, you are the author. Which way are you going to live? He is able to humble those who are proud.

Let's pray. Father, as we go to your table,  we pray that you would give us the look at our sin  and the look at your mercy that will heal us of our pride. Many of us right now are experiencing the kind of difficulties  that come from being full of self-absorption,  comparing ourselves to others,  having our feelings hurt. Oh Lord, help us to see all life as a gift. Help us to see even our troubles as part of your mercy.

Help us to see our material possessions  as all part of your gift to us. Help us to have the kind of easy joy,  generous spirit, incredible confidence  that comes from knowing that we don't belong to ourselves,  but we are a work of art, the creator of the universe. Help us to understand that as we pick up the bread and the cup. We ask it in Jesus' name, amen. Thanks for listening to today's teaching.

### 引言：破碎的世界

为什么世界如此破碎？为什么我们甚至能够对我们所爱的人造成如此大的伤害？人们将原因归结于政治、贫困或心理学，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己和历史中看到的现象。本月的播客中，Tim Keller 从一系列探讨我们出了什么问题的问题中进行教导。圣经关于罪的教导提供了唯一足够深入的解释，能够面对真相的复杂性，并提供唯一足够强大的希望来改变我们。

### 尼布甲尼撒的故事

让我为你读尼布甲尼撒的故事，你实际上刚刚听过。这段故事在但以理书第4章，实际上从章节的开头就开始了。在章节的开头，尼布甲尼撒，巴比伦的大王，召见但以理为他解梦。我们会深入探讨并描述那个梦，但我们从第24节开始阅读，这是但以理在说话。

> "王啊，这是解梦，这也是至高者对我主王所发的命令。你必被赶出离开人群，与野兽同居。你要吃草如牛，被天露淋湿。七个时期要经过，直到你承认至高者在人的国中掌权，愿意赐给谁就赐给谁。"

**留下树桩和根的命令意味着当你承认天国掌权时，你的国度将被恢复给你。**

### 骄傲的沉睡

十二个月后，当国王在巴比伦王宫的屋顶上行走时，他说：“这不是我用大能建造的伟大巴比伦吗？为我王宫的居所，为我威严的荣耀吗？”话还在他口中，天上就有声音说：“尼布甲尼撒王啊，有话对你说：你的王权已离开你。”

### 骄傲的核心

骄傲，属灵的骄傲，是那种看待生活并看待生活中所有事物并说：“我做到了，我正在做。我做到了。凭我大能，我为我威严的荣耀而做。生活是由我和为我而存在的。”

**骄傲是声称自己是实际上是礼物的作者。骄傲是一种宇宙剽窃。**

### 骄傲的结果

尼布甲尼撒变成了一只动物。我们理解发生了什么，我们现在知道他疯了，这是生理上的事情，是大脑化学的事情，我们对此有所了解。他认为自己是一只动物，开始像动物一样生活了七个时期。

### 骄傲的医治

唯一的医治方法是上帝必须来做。在CS路易斯的《纳尼亚传奇》中有一个关于尤斯塔斯的伟大故事。他是一个骄傲的小男孩。在这个特定的童话故事中，他带着贪婪的想法在龙的宝藏上入睡。当他醒来时，他已经变成了一条龙。

**你必须看到你不配从上帝那里得到任何东西，只有审判。然而，同时，你必须看到你是上帝最大怜悯的对象。**

## Chinese Transcript / 中文

欢迎来到「生命福音」（Gospel in Life）。为什么这个世界如此破碎？为什么我们竟然有能力，对那些我们所爱的人也造成那么大的伤害？人们会把原因归咎于政治、贫穷或心理问题，但没有一种解释能真正说明，我们在自己里面、以及在历史中所看见的一切。

在这个月的播客中，提姆·凯勒要从一系列讲道中，带领我们来思想这个问题：到底我们出了什么问题？

认识圣经关于罪的教导，是如何在所有复杂层面上，给出足够深刻的解释，面对事实的真相；也唯有这个教导，提供了足够有能力的盼望，能真正改变我们。

让我来读一遍尼布甲尼撒的故事——其实你刚才已经听过一次了。这段经文在但以理书第 4 章。故事实际上从本章一开始就展开：起初，大巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒请先知但以理来，替他解一个梦。我们等一下会讲到那个梦、描述那个梦，但我们读经的段落是从第 24 节开始，这是但以理在说话：

「王啊，这就是那梦的讲解；也是自高者临到我主我王的旨意。
你必被赶出离开世人，与你住在田野的兽同居，吃草如牛，被天露滴湿；且要经过七期，等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐予谁就赐予谁。
吩咐存留这树的根于地内，表示你必有国位，等你知道诸天掌权。
王啊，求你悦纳我的谏言，以行义断绝你的罪，以怜悯穷人除掉你的罪孽，或者你的平安可以延长。」

这一切事都临到尼布甲尼撒王。
过了十二个月，他游行在巴比伦王宫顶上，他说：
「这大巴比伦，不是我用大能大力建为京都，要显我威严的荣耀吗？」
这话在王口中尚未说完，有声音从天降下说：
「尼布甲尼撒王啊，有话对你说：你的国位离开你了。你必被赶出离开世人，与野地的兽同居，吃草如牛；要经过七期，等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐予谁就赐予谁。」
当时这话就应验在尼布甲尼撒的身上，他被赶出离开世人，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，头发长长，好像鹰毛，指甲长长，如同鸟爪。

「日子满了，我尼布甲尼撒举目望天，我的聪明复归于我；我便称颂至高者，赞美、尊敬活到永远的那一位：他的国存到永远，他的权柄存到万代。
世上所有的居民都算为虚无，在天上的万军和世上的居民中，他都凭自己的意旨行事，无人能拦住他的手，或问他说：你做什么呢？」

那时，我的聪明复归于我；为我国的荣耀、威严和光荣，我的谋士和大臣来寻找我，我又坚立在国位上，至大的权柄仍加给我。
现在我尼布甲尼撒赞美、尊崇、荣耀天上的王，因为他所行的全都诚实，他所做的也都公平，那行动骄傲的，他能降为卑。」

这是上帝的话。

现在，关于尼布甲尼撒这个名字，本身没什么好笑的。但在公元前六世纪，他是巴比伦帝国的绝对君王。这是什么意思呢？

你知道，汤姆·沃尔夫在《虚荣的篝火》里创造了一个词——「宇宙主宰」（Masters of the Universe）。他用这个词来形容那些华尔街大鳄，在他们心里，他们觉得自己因为年薪七位数，就站在世界之巅。沃尔夫说，在他们心里，他们把自己当成那一小撮人：宇宙主宰。「我用自己的大能，成就了这一切，只为显出自己荣耀的威严。我真是站在世界之巅。」

但你看，在这里，他面对的是一个真正意义上的「宇宙主宰」，不是一个住在你家附近的华尔街人。他真的是当时所知道的整个世界的绝对君王。凡是在他文明视野之内的地方，他都是绝对的统治者。

于是，他就建造了也许是历史上最不可思议的一座城市——巴比伦——作为他自己的王宫和居所。按比例来说，那座城市相对于当时的世界，比今天的纽约市要大得多、重要得多。

而且还有一件事。你可以想象一座像纽约这样有权势、多元的城市，却又是绿意盎然的——因为尼布甲尼撒所做的，就是打造了当时能做到的「高楼」，建造了一座令人惊叹的城市，还让整座城市像一座公园——那就是古代世界七大奇景之一「空中花园」。

然而，虽然他站在权力的巅峰，也许拥有一种只有历史上寥寥数人曾经拥有过的权势，他的生命却还是崩溃了。等到这一切结束的时候，最不可思议的是：他为此欢喜。他为所发生的一切感谢上帝。

你知道为什么吗？因为他说，他里面有一种属灵的癌症，有某种东西坏到一个地步、危险到一个地步，以至于它深深毒害了他的灵魂——所以，即便治疗的手段这么激烈，也值得；只要能把这样的癌症从他的生命中拔除，就值得。

那是什么？就是骄傲──属灵的骄傲。

我想，也许在世界上没有哪一个地方，比这里更需要谈论这种罪了。尤其是在这个例子之下——你知道，人来到纽约是带着梦想来的，
带着梦想而来。你来到纽约，是因为你在某方面很有恩赐；你来，是因为你想在自己所擅长的事情上，成为最顶尖的人。

因此，世界上大概没有比这里更需要问这些问题的地方了：有可能我们的心思，像他的心思一样被蒙蔽吗？有可能，正如我们将要看到的，我们的睡眠也正被跟他同样的原因所扰动吗？有可能，你的生命现在正在崩溃，或是即将崩溃，原因与他一样，是为了让你学到与他同样的功课吗？

如果在座有人说：「我不可能有属灵的骄傲。」那么你要知道：按照圣经的「诊断手册」，会这样说话正是属灵骄傲的第一个征兆。

这有点像老师开的一个玩笑题，是不是？但这就是圣经的教导。

来，我们来看。这段经文关于骄傲教我们的内容，可以概括为四点：骄傲的睡眠、骄傲的核心、骄傲的结局和骄傲的医治。

睡眠、核心、结局和医治——我们一个一个来看。

欢迎来到"福音在生活中"。为什么这个世界如此破碎？为什么我们甚至能够对所爱之人造成如此伤害？人们将此归咎于政治、贫穷或心理因素，但这些都无法完全解释我们在自己身上和历史中所看到的现象。本月的播客中，提姆·凯勒将教导一个系列，探讨这个问题：我们到底出了什么问题？

了解圣经关于罪的教导如何提供唯一足够深刻的解释来面对所有复杂性中的真相，以及唯一足够强大的盼望来改变我们。让我读给你们听尼布甲尼撒的故事，实际上你们刚才已经听过了。这记载在但以理书第4章，确实是从这一章的开头开始的。在这一章的开头，但以理被巴比伦的伟大君王尼布甲尼撒召来为他解梦。我们会深入探讨并描述那个梦，但我们从第24节开始读起，这是但以理在说话。

这是对王的解释。这是至高者对我主我王所发的命令。你必被赶出离开世人，与野兽同住。你必吃草如牛，被天露滴湿。日期满足七期，等你知道至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁就赐与谁。

留树墩不拔树根，意思是说，等你承认诸天掌权之后，你的国必定归还给你。王啊，求你悦纳我的谏言，以施行公义断绝罪过，以怜悯穷人除掉罪孽，或者你的平安可以延长。

这事都临到尼布甲尼撒王。过了十二个月，当王在巴比伦王宫的平顶上行走的时候，他说：这大巴比伦不是我用大能大力建为京都，要显我威严的荣耀吗？

这话还在王口中的时候，有声音从天降下说：尼布甲尼撒王啊，有话对你说，你的国位离开你了。你必被赶出离开世人，与野兽同住

与你野地的走兽同住。

你必被撵离人群，与野兽同居，吃草如牛。要经过七期，直到你承认至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐给谁就赐给谁。后来，临到尼布甲尼撒王的一切就都应验了。他被驱离世人，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，头发长长，如鹰的翎毛，指甲长长，如鸟的爪。

日子满了，我尼布甲尼撒举目望天，我的理智就归回于我。于是我称颂至高者，赞美尊敬那活到永远的，因为他的权柄是永远的权柄，他的国存到万代。

世上所有的居民在他面前都算为虚无。他凭自己的意旨，随意在天上的万军和地上的居民中行事，无人能拦住他的手，或对他说：你作什么呢？那时，我的理智归回于我，为我国的荣耀，我的尊荣和光耀也归回于我。我的谋士和大臣都来寻访我，我又得坚立在国位上，并且加添了极大的威严于我。

现在我尼布甲尼撒赞美、尊崇、荣耀天上的王，因为他所行的全都诚实，他所作的也都公义；凡行事骄傲的，他能降卑。这是上帝的话。——尼布甲尼撒这个名字本身并没有什么好笑的地方。在公元前六世纪，他是巴比伦帝国的绝对君王。那意味着什么呢？

你知道，汤姆·沃尔夫在《虚荣的篝火》里创造了一个词，叫“宇宙的主宰”（Masters of the Universe）。那是他放在某个华尔街大人物脑子里的一个称呼，这些人因为一年挣七位数，就觉得自己站在世界之巅。汤姆·沃尔夫说，在他心里，他把自己看作那一小撮精英：宇宙的主宰——“靠着我大能的权柄，为显我威严的荣耀”，我真的是登上了世界顶峰。

可是在这里，尼布甲尼撒是一个真正意义上的“宇宙主宰”，不是一个就住在我们街角附近的普通人。他们在他们所知道的世界里，对一切拥有绝对权柄。每一个……

他所知道的世界，或者说他的文明所知道的世界的那一部分，他是绝对的君主。因此，他建造了也许是历史上最不可思议的城市。他建造巴比伦作为他的个人居所。而且按比例来说，相对于世界其他地方，它比现在的纽约市要大得多。

他还拥有另一样东西。想象一下纽约，它所有的权力，所有的多样性，然后再加上绿色。因为尼布甲尼撒所做的，你可以，古代世界七大奇迹之一，尼布甲尼撒的空中花园，他在巴比伦所做的是建造了那个时代所能建造的那种摩天大楼。他创造了这座令人难以置信的城市，它就像一个公园。巴比伦的空中花园。

然而，尽管这是一个处于权力巅峰的人，也许是一种只有历史上大约六个人曾经拥有过的权力。无论如何，他的生活还是崩溃了。当一切结束时，这就是令人难以置信的部分。他很高兴这发生了。他很高兴。

他赞美上帝做了这件事。你知道为什么吗？因为他说在我里面有一个属灵的癌症。在我里面有一样东西，它是如此糟糕。它是如此危险，以至于它深深地毒害了我的灵魂，尽管治疗是如此激烈，但它值得把它从我的灵魂中除去。

那是什么？骄傲。属灵的骄傲。而且我认为也许在世界上没有比这里更重要的地方来谈论这个特别的人了。在这个特别的案例中，因为你知道，人们带着梦想来到纽约。

梦想。你来到纽约是因为你擅长某件事，你带着梦想来到纽约，梦想成为也许是某件事上最好的。因此，也许没有比这里更重要的地方来问这些问题了。会不会我们自己的思想也像他一样被蒙蔽了？会不会，正如我们将要看到的，我们自己的睡眠正因同样的原因而被困扰？

会不会你的生活现在正在崩溃，或者你的生活即将崩溃，原因与他的相同，为了他所学到的同样的功课。如果这里有人说，好吧，我不可能有属灵的骄傲，你应该知道，在圣经的诊断手册中，这就是它的第一个征兆

说些什么。我们来看，这位老师——那是个卑鄙的伎俩吗？无论如何，这就是圣经的教导。

你听，这段经文告诉我们关于骄傲的四件事：它让我们看到骄傲的迷睡、骄傲的本质、骄傲的结局，以及骄傲的医治。迷睡、本质、结局和医治——我们一一来看。先看“迷睡”。你注意这里说“过了十二个月”，看见了吗？这里说“十二个月以后”。那么十二个月以前发生了什么呢？如果你读这段经文一开始的部分，故事是这样展开的：世上有这么一个人，你会以为他是世界上唯一一个不需要忧虑的人；没有任何事能扰乱他的睡眠，没有什么能搅动他的心。

他是世上唯一一个永远不用担心被炒鱿鱼的人。你看，没有人会把他“裁员”。同样你可能会说：啊，是的，可他总得担心别国的军队吧？——哪支军队呢？他是绝对君王，别人哪还有军队？在本章较前面的经文里（我们没读到的地方），第四节他说：我尼布甲尼撒安居在宫中，日子平顺，生活昌盛。我安然入睡，却被一个梦惊醒。我安居乐业，但却被一个梦吓坏了。

梦里，他看见一棵树，顶天立地，高到直达穹苍，巨大到一个宇宙性的程度，以致天下万物都在这树荫之下。天上的飞鸟、地上的走兽，整个世界，全都栖息在这棵树底下。它何等壮丽！然而，突然在梦中，有一个从天上来的声音说：砍倒这棵树，剥去它的叶子，抛散它的果子，让天露滴湿树桩，要经过七期。这样做的目的是什么呢？那个声音说——我照录给你听——“好叫世人知道，至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐给谁就赐给谁，又立极卑微的人掌权。”

当然，他非常不安。于是尼布甲尼撒召来神的仆人但以理，对他说：但以理，我把梦告诉你，你告诉我这是什么意思。神的仆人但以理听完梦境之后，圣经说，他脸都白了，他惊骇万分。然后他说——以下是他的话……

第22节的话语中说，王啊，你就是那棵树？上帝要来使你谦卑，上帝要来砍倒你，上帝要来向你显明，你不是宇宙的主宰，而是软弱的、卑微的，你只是靠着他的旨意而活。所以看，你看到但以理在我们所读经文的开头说话，他说，上帝要来，他要来使你谦卑，他关切地说，因此，请你听从我的劝告。改变吧，转向吧，悔改吧，谦卑你自己，也许这事就不会临到你身上。但我们被告知，12个月后，有事发生了。

但我们从这里学到什么呢？在我们继续真正谈论骄傲之心之前，让我告诉你我们学到了什么。这教导我们什么？它教导我们这一点。无论你认为自己有多么成功，或将会有多么成功，无论你认为自己多么成功，或将会多么成功，满足和繁荣，这是尼布甲尼撒用的两个词，他说，我是满足的，我是繁荣的，我是我所看到的一切的主人，但我无法入睡。

无论你认为自己能获得多么满足，无论多么繁荣，它永远不会是完全的，永远不会。尼布甲尼撒知道世界上只有少数人真正知道的事情，要真正知道这一点，要真正知道这一点，你必须到达顶峰，而我们当中很少很少的人能够到达。我正在阅读，我在看A&E频道关于霍华德·休斯的传记。传记、报纸、个人认识都告诉我们，那些处于顶端的人，最顶端的人，生活中的尼布甲尼撒们，都是深受困扰的人。为什么？

因为他们学到了我们其余人所否认的事实，那就是人的灵魂想要的东西是如此巨大，以至于你可以把世界上所有的帝国都倒进那个洞里，倒进那颗心里，你可以把世界上所有的帝国都倒进你的灵魂里，它仍然得不到满足。那么我们真正追求的是什么呢？看，只有世界上的尼布甲尼撒们才真正理解这一点。这就是为什么他们绝望，因为他们无法满足，他们无法繁荣，他们无法入睡。有什么不对劲，有什么缺失。

什么东西能让你把整个世界都倒进去呢？而霍华德·休斯们、尼布甲尼撒们以及那些人

像这样的人，内心深处非常不安，因为他们知道一些我们不知道的事。人的灵魂渴望一个比世界更大的东西，可那会是什么呢？他们不知道，其实在两千年前，有一个小小的马槽里，曾经盛放过一个比世界更大的存在。而任何一个心，无论多么简单、污秽或软弱，只要接纳他，也能在里面拥有一个比世界更大的实在，真正使人得着满足。

因此，无论怎么看，骄傲都不能带来安眠。成功、成就、那种掌控自己世界的感觉——你渴望这一切。我们大多数人一生都在努力往那儿爬，一边说：只要我终于能到那儿就好了；可那些真的到了那儿的人，却睡不着。——这就是“骄傲的迷睡”。

好，第二，我们来看“骄傲的本质”。顺带说一句，这里我们也看到另一件事：因为上帝是怜悯的上帝，他看见骄傲可怕的结局（我们一会儿就要看），所以他会给你差遣声音、差遣梦境、差遣“但以理”，只要你认得出它们是什么。

它们是什么呢？它们都是来告诉你：你并不在掌权。你以为你掌管自己的生命，或者你想要掌控自己的生命，但你并没有。也许某个“但以理”今天把你带到了教会。我盼望你能认出这些声音、这些“但以理”、这些梦，它们就是神怜悯的使者。

然而，尼布甲尼撒不听。又过了十二个月，他起来说：这大巴比伦，不是我用大能大力建为王宫、要显我威严的荣耀吗？——这就是骄傲。你若想知道骄傲是什么，当圣经谈到神叫骄傲的人降卑时，它不是在说那种“好”意义上的骄傲。有一种我们照样称为“骄傲”的东西是好的。

当然，我一生中读过的最喜欢的一句关于这件事的话，就是伊萨克·迪内森（Isak Dinesen）说的：骄傲是对上帝创造你时那个念头的信心。她的意思是——圣经教导我们，你不是偶然的产物。上帝创造了你，他按着尊严和……

祂按照设计创造了你。当一个人开始理解并掌握圣经所说的，当你为此欣喜，当你为此陶醉，当你思考这一切时，它会在你里面创造出一种稳定性。它在你里面创造出喜乐。它在你里面创造出一种自信。这可以被称为骄傲，但这不是尼布甲尼撒在这里所说的那种骄傲。

当他说，祂能够使骄傲的人降卑。他所说的是这个，骄傲，属灵的骄傲是这样的：看着生命，看着生命中的一切事物，然后说，是我做的，是我在做。是我做的。凭我的大能，我为我威严的荣耀而做。生命是出于我，也是为了我。

让我拆解一下。首先，骄傲是这样的：看着你生命中的美好事物，然后说，那是出于我。是我做的。是我成就的。如果你的生活顺利，你看着这一切然后说，是因为我工作得更努力。

我做得比别人好的原因是因为我比别人工作得更努力。或者我比别人工作得更聪明，或者我工作得更多，或者比别人更有道德操守，或者无论你说什么，那都是出于我。是我做的。因此，其次，骄傲看着生命和生命中的美好事物，然后说，因此，我应得。骄傲使我们带着一种深深的亏欠感看待生命。

骄傲使我们看着生命说，我应得这些美好的事物。现在，让我告诉你一件事。骄傲有很多形式，你必须小心。骄傲在美好的生活或艰难的生活中都会起作用。当你的生活顺利时，骄傲是这样运作的。

你说，我得到这些美好的事物。我做得比别人好，因为我工作得比别人好。我比别人工作得更聪明或更努力。你说，你说，因此，我应得这些。当你的生活不顺利时，当事情不如意时，你会怎么做？

你看着生命说，我比别人受苦更多。事情不公平。我的生活比别人更艰难。因此，我应得这些。这是同样的事。

无论你的生活是顺利还是艰难，骄傲的意思就是属灵的骄傲使你

看着自己的人生，说：我应得的比现在得到的要多。属灵上的骄傲，会让你无论顺境逆境，都在心里说：我本该得到的更多，现在的一切都是我应得的，我甚至被亏欠了。

与此相反，圣经中的“谦卑”是完全不同的东西。让我给“骄傲”下一点定义：骄傲就是把本来是礼物的东西，说成是出自自己。骄傲让你看待自己的人生时，说：“我是这一切的作者”，而实际上，全都是白白的恩赐。骄傲是一种“属灵抄袭”。有些东西被带进了你的人生，有些东西被赐给了你，而你却说：是我写的，是我谱的，是我成就的。你自称为那份纯然恩赐的作者。

谦卑则完全不同。谦卑这样看人生：这一切都是礼物。谦卑看万事万物，都说：我不配得这些。如果上帝按我“应得的”待我，我早就灭亡了；但你看这一件、那一件——这一切的一切，全是“额外的恩典”，全都是礼物。

有人说：哦，这太糟糕了。你的意思是，一个谦卑的人——你说一个基督徒是谦卑的——整天觉得自己什么都不配得？这不会太糟糕吗？这不是自卑吗？这不是很可怕吗？你说“我不配拥有任何东西”，岂不是会叫人厌世、恨人生吗？

不，你混淆了两种东西。真正的“谦卑”，是把人生当作礼物来领受。有一种“伪谦卑”说：我不配，所以我不要；我不配，所以我不接受；“我太糟糕了，我是个失败者，我是个坏人，所以这个不要，那个也不要；我不要朋友，不要喜乐，不要这些东西。”——那不过是另一种形式的骄傲。

那里面真正的意思是：我想靠自己赚得这一切；如果不是我挣来的，我就不要。结果当然是你很痛苦。表面上你说“我不配”，但在底层仍然有一种“我应该靠自己来获得”的心态。

真正的谦卑说：我不配拥有我生命里这些美好的事物；如果上帝照着我该得的对待我，我早就灭亡了；然而你看，这些祝福一件一件临到我。——所以，真正的谦卑把“我应得什么”这个概念，完全从心里挪开了。

骄傲，整个骄傲的体系。谦卑说，我根本无法配得神赐给我的美好事物——我的健康、我的头脑、我的朋友。

我所拥有的，都是恩典，你说，看看这个，因此你每天享受的一切都像这种冲动。每一天都是一个惊喜。这就是礼物，一个好礼物让你惊喜，它比你想象的更好。你不知道它会来。它是完全免费的。

它是不配得的。你用这种方式看待一切。我们所到之处都看到破碎、战争、残酷和心痛。我们在周围的世界和自己的生活中感受到它。事情怎么会变成这样，又能做些什么呢？

在他本月发行的全新著作《世界出了什么问题？》中，提姆·凯勒给出了一个清晰而富有同情心的答案。从在救赎主教会的一系列教导中汲取内容，凯勒博士展示了罪的现实如何解释我们周围看到的痛苦，以及唯有福音如何提供持久的自由和医治。无论你是被我们世界的状况所压倒，还是在与自己的错误或选择挣扎，或是在寻找希望和喜乐，《世界出了什么问题？》都将帮助你看到福音如何既回应我们世界的心痛，也回应我们每个人内心的痛苦。

那么骄傲有什么不好呢？有人说，骄傲有什么不好？我的意思是，尼布甲尼撒环顾四周说，这不是我挣来的吗，难道不是吗？你知道他确实是那个时代最伟大的军事天才吗？你知道他每次上战场都是冒着生命危险的。

他可以单枪匹马打败所有那些人。他不是那种只会按按钮的短臂将军。他坐上战车，冲在最前面。他也许是历史上最伟大的政治领袖之一，难道不是他做到的吗？说这些有什么不好，这就是不好的地方，听着，约翰写道，约翰你在哪里？

约翰写道，他作曲

那首曲子。——要是我偷了它呢？要是我把自己的名字写上去呢？我要是拿给别人，说：“你看，这是我写的。”他们会说：“太惊人了！你不仅是个传道人，还是个优秀的音乐家、了不起的作曲家，谁见过这样多才多艺的人？”——那我做了什么？

为什么约翰（那首曲子的原作者）有权利非常愤怒？你为什么会愤怒？如果你发现了这件事，你可能再也不会来听我讲道了，为什么？因为你会说：你把本该属于他的荣耀抢走了，你从他手里把他的作品夺了过去。

因为作者拥有作品，作者对作品有主权。圣经告诉我们，为什么我们这么骄傲，为什么我们不愿承认自己生命中的一切都是礼物、我们本不配得任何东西、我们每一口气息都依赖上帝？因为一旦你承认他是作者，一旦你承认自己完全依赖上帝，你就失去了“掌控权”。

而我们不愿意失去这一点。还记得多萝西·塞耶斯（Dorothy Sayers）说过吗？“罪是一种灵魂深处的内在错位”，是一种想要抓住对自己生命的控制权的欲望。而你要为自己现在握在手里的那种“掌控”，找到合理性，唯一的办法就是拒绝承认你对他有多么依赖。

你说：我没有控制我的生命啊，我是个宗教人士。朋友们，听着：人心就是这样运作的，即便你很“宗教”。你会说：我会考虑宗教传统，我会参考圣经，但最终决定我身体怎么用的，是我自己；我最终决定我的舌头怎么用、我的思想怎样想、我的钱怎么花的，是我自己；我来判断顺服圣经到底现不现实，值不值得。如果你曾经这样想过，哪怕一次，你仍然是自己生命的主人。

而你之所以能心安理得地这样做，唯一的解释就是：你说服自己——“我并不是完全依赖上帝，我多少是自己挣来的。”

看看尼布甲尼撒——朋友们，你们这些“自我成就的人”，你的人生中有多少东西真的是你能掌控的？你没有选择自己的种族，没有选择自己的性别，没有选择你出生的世纪。你也没有决定你出生在这里、现在，而不是在十四世纪的欧洲。

在黑死病期间，你不认为这对你今天的成就有一点影响吗。你说，我努力工作，用什么工作呢，用那头脑，用那些才干，用那些能力，用那些友谊，用那些关系，这些都是神，也唯有神赐给你的。你没有选择你的父母，你没有选择你的兄弟姐妹，你没有选择你任何早期的童年经历，而我们都说这些经历是如此具有塑造性。你没有选择你的基本能力和才干，以及这些能力的水平。神说，什么，你想知道什么是谦卑吗？

你想知道什么是骄傲吗？保罗在哥林多前书4章6节和7节说，你们不可。你们不可因这人或那人而自高，因为使你与人不同的是谁呢？你有什么不是领受的呢？你们不可因这人或那人而自高，因为是什么使你与众不同？你有什么不是作为礼物领受的呢？

圣经说，这就是谦卑，喜乐的生命是将一切都作为礼物领受，而自我专注因而悲惨的生命是看着一切说，我应得这个，我应得这个，我应得这个。现在，尼布甲尼撒变成了一只动物。我们明白发生了什么，我们现在明白他疯了，这是一件生理上的事，是脑化学的事，我们对此有所了解。他以为自己是动物，他开始像动物一样生活了七期，这可能意味着七个月或者也许七个季节，那将是一年半左右。但有一段时间，他以为自己是动物。

我们说，哦，这是临到我们身上的那些灾难之一，你知道，精神疾病，这不是，这不是他的错，确实不是，但这是一个教训。你知道这教导我们什么吗？神在向我们显明骄傲会毁坏你的人性。神在对尼布甲尼撒说，尼布甲尼撒，听我说。因为你坚持试图成为比我所造的你更多的东西，你将成为比我所造的你更少的东西。

因为你渴望成为超过人的存在，你就变成不如人的存在。这不只是神任意的行为。他试图向尼布甲尼撒显明骄傲对人做了什么

无论如何——当我的孩子对我说谎的时候，我们会怎么做？任何好父母都知道，管教应该尽量让孩子尝到“自然的后果”。你会说：宝贝，如果你长大成了一个说谎的人，你不会有朋友，你会被孤立，你可能会进监狱，你的人生会一团糟。所以，因为我们现在不能信任你——因为你撒谎——你这一周不能出门，不能去找朋友，不能出去玩，因为我们不能相信你说的话。

上帝好像说：我得救你脱离你现在所走的路最终的结局。骄傲——那种想要超越“作人”的界限，要作“超人”的骄傲——正在把你变得不像人。我必须真的让你变得像一头兽，才能让你看见你身上正在发生什么。

你会问：骄傲怎么会把人变成兽呢？其实很简单，听着。第一，骄傲会使你像动物一样，失去同理心。

我家里有一只动物——一只猫。你知道，猫有时候看起来好像很同情你，它会在你难过的时候过来蹭你一下，你会想：“哇，它懂我。”然后你会发现：哦，原来它饿了。猫——动物——是没有想象力的；因为没有想象力，就没有艺术，所以也没有真正的同理心。动物无法想象别人正在经历什么，无法像圣经所说的那样“与哀哭的人同哭，与喜乐的人同乐”。它们做不到。

而骄傲是一种癌症，会把你里面那一点点人性也吞噬掉。你什么时候最有人味？就是当你有怜悯心的时候；当你能感觉到别人正在感受什么的时候，你就最像一个“人”。但什么是骄傲呢？骄傲是一整套用来合理化你对自己生命掌控权的说辞。你要维持这种掌控，就得不断告诉自己：我配得这个，我应得这个。

骄傲让你走进一个房间——我常看到这种事——也许你来了一间新教会，你环顾四周，说：这些人是不是我想要交往的那种人？这些人是不是能理解我的那种人？这些人是不是能……

同情我？这些人是那种能增强我想要看到自己是谁的感觉的人吗？那正在吞噬你的人性。骄傲让你只想，他们在为我哭泣吗？

他们在为我欢欣吗？骄傲让你如此痛苦，因为你如此专注于自己。以至于你甚至无法注意到人们在这个角落里哭泣，你甚至无法注意到那个角落里的人们。骄傲让你像动物一样无法同理心，我们再给你另一个例子。骄傲让你像动物一样被自我生存本能所驱使。

在鲁益师的《返璞归真》一书中关于骄傲的部分有一个很好的段落，他有一个关于骄傲的很好的章节，在其中他这样说，骄傲使人心想要远离任何比它更好、更强大或更高的东西。任何可能让它感到渺小的东西，或者向它显示，它没有权利成为它希望成为的宇宙中心。你知道他在说什么吗？是骄傲让你感到威胁。

是骄傲，也只有骄傲，当你处在一种情境中，有人让你觉得不那么有吸引力，有人让你觉得不那么聪明，有人让你觉得不那么机敏时，你会感到不快乐，你会感到威胁。只有骄傲能做到这一点。正是它让你把自己与他人比较。只有骄傲让你憎恨那些你必须承认脆弱的情境，你必须承认软弱，你必须承认我需要帮助。你必须承认我对我的问题无能为力。

我们讨厌它。我们不愿承认。因此，像一只受惊的动物，我们逃避那些威胁我们的事物。我们逃避那些威胁我们的人。你曾经被某人威胁过。

如果你曾经，正如鲁益师在某处说的，你知道为什么吗？你知道谁最憎恨爱吹嘘的人吗？你必须非常骄傲才会憎恨骄傲的人。你必须非常骄傲，因为那些占据中心舞台的人，你如此憎恨他们的原因是因为你觉得，我比他或她更应该得到那个中心舞台。

骄傲让你像动物一样被自我生存本能所驱使。也许最后，骄傲像动物一样让你无法体验喜乐。

你说：“等等，等等，你这就不公平了。我其实挺爱动物的。动物也会快乐啊！别跟我说动物不会快乐。你没听过猫打呼噜吗？”

是的，猫可以“满足”，但猫没有“喜乐”。动物只会在环境刚刚好的时候，感到那种短暂的舒服。动物不会在患难中“欢喜”；动物不会超越环境以上；动物没有任何东西——你看——没有任何东西能让它们在困境之中仍然有喜乐。

骄傲把你生命中的喜乐都吸干了。你知道它是怎么做到的吗？如果事情顺利，你会说：“嗯，总算如此了。”甚至会说：“早该如此了！这事五年前就该发生。”你看骄傲在做什么？一切都是“应得的”。“我配得这些。”是不是？

而如果事情非常糟糕，你里面就苦毒，说：“这太不公平了！”骄傲既毁掉了你面对苦难的能力，也把顺境当中的甘甜与喜乐一并抽空。

那么，医治骄傲只有一条路。尼布甲尼撒发现了这条路。你知道怎么发生的吗？唯一能医治骄傲的，是上帝亲自出手。

C.S.刘易斯在《纳尼亚传奇》里讲过一个极好的故事，关于尤斯提（Eustace）。尤斯提是一个骄傲的小男孩，在这个童话故事里，他带着贪婪的念头睡在一笔龙的宝藏上，结果醒来时，自己变成了一条龙。他试着把“龙皮”一层一层剥掉，却发现，下面仍然是龙皮。

最后，他不得不来到基督的预表——亚斯蓝面前。亚斯蓝对他说：“我要亲自来给你剥。”他必须让亚斯蓝来动手。于是狮子亚斯蓝伸出爪子，用力一撕。尤斯提说：“我以为那会杀了我，我以为那一爪会伸到我心里去。”

刘易斯想要告诉我们的是：我们大多数人都隐约知道，自己问题的很大一部分来自骄傲。为什么你晚上翻来覆去睡不着，只因为有人冷落了你？你难道不厌烦这种“自我中心”的缠绕吗？你难道不讨厌自己总是……

你自己呢？你不讨厌那种自我专注吗？那是痛苦的。所以你试图用意志力来改变它。

我不要再这么多地想自己了。你做不到的。你必须让祂为你卸下装扮。唯一能卸下你的装扮、医治你骄傲的方法，就是你必须同时看到两件事。你必须看到你不配从神那里得到任何东西，只配得审判。

你必须看到你在宇宙中的剽窃行为。你必须看到你窃取了你的生命，以为自己是作者，而实际上，你的一切都亏欠于祂。这是可怕的罪。你不配从神那里得到任何东西，只配得审判。然而与此同时，你必须看到你是神最大怜悯的对象。

要一起看，你必须同时看到这两者。如果你看不到两者，如果你只看到一个而不看另一个，你就不会得医治。但如果你同时看到两者，这就是尼布甲尼撒所经历的。你注意到，首先，尼布甲尼撒说，看，他承认所有的民都算不得什么。

世上所有的居民都被看为虚无。他在说他自己。他站起来说，我已经学到，当坏事临到你身上，当打击进入你内心时，似乎直击你的心灵。你可以在骄傲中接受它，说，我不配遭受这样的困难，或者你可以像尼布甲尼撒所做的那样。也就是说，尼布甲尼撒意识到，我配得这个。

这向我显明了我的脆弱。这向我显明了我是谁。他让这打击使他谦卑，而不是使他刚硬。这是第一件事。然后第二件事，他认识到所有他以前认为是他应得权利的东西，现在都回到了他身上，而他把这一切都看作是恩赐。

你看他的态度，它们被恢复了。在经历了这一切之后，我的谋士们仍然愿意跟我说话。看，现在他把一切都看作是恩赐，因为神只是把树砍到树墩，祂没有连根拔起树墩。祂向尼布甲尼撒施怜悯。

祂怎么能向尼布甲尼撒施怜悯呢？祂怎么能饶恕尼布甲尼撒所做的一切呢？祂怎么能做到这一点？嗯，尼布甲尼撒不知道，但你我知道。你知道为什么吗？

尼布甲尼撒不是宇宙的主宰，

可他却被当作罪人对待。耶稣基督是历史上唯一一位站在地上、真正配称为“宇宙的主宰”的人；但他却甘愿放下这一切。你知道为什么吗？

以赛亚书五十二章有一段关于“仆人”的预言，论到要来的那位弥赛亚。那里说：“我的仆人行事必有智慧，必被高举上升，且成为至高。然而许多人因为他惊奇；他的面貌比别人憔悴，他的形容比世人枯槁。如此，他必撒许多国民；君王要向他闭口。”

耶稣基督来到世上，被鞭打、被凌辱，被撕裂、被刺透，以致看见他的人都惊骇，因为他几乎看不出是个人形。你知道他为什么这样做吗？——为要“洒净许多国民”，为要担当我们的罪。

为什么他必须这样做？因为在我们的骄傲里，我们企图不再只是“人”，而要扮演“神”；所以耶稣基督就必须舍弃本来属于他的荣耀，成为“比人还不如”的样式，好叫我们能得着他所拥有的一切。“神使那无罪的，替我们成为罪，好叫我们在他里面成为神的义。”

当你被这骄傲医治以后，但以理告诉你，你会变成什么样。首先，你会像尼布甲尼撒一样，举目望天说：“你所行的全都正确。”

你知道那本极具吸引力、卖得很好的书《当好人遭遇坏事》吗？你知道为什么大家对世上的苦难这么难以释怀吗？那里有一个潜藏的前提，需要你来证明——这个前提是：这个世界“比我们应得的更糟糕”。哦，真的吗？给我证据看。

人之所以看着这个世界如此难以接受，是因为他假定：“世界对我不公，我配得更好。”然而，成为基督徒之后，你开始意识到：这个世界其实“比我们应得的好得多”。因此，即使你跨过痛苦、跨过患难、跨过悲剧，你仍然会抬头望天——这也正是福音有没有医治你骄傲的“试金石”：你能否对上帝说——“你所行的，全都正直”？

你能承受苦难的能力，完全取决于你是否相信：这个世界是“比我们应得的更糟”——还是“比我们应得的更好”。

无论你认为我们配得的是更好还是更坏，这将完全取决于你对福音的信仰。但其次，但以理说，记得当他对尼布甲尼撒说，请转身并谦卑自己，这样这些坏事就不会临到你。你知道他说了什么吗？

你看他告诉我要做什么？他说，记念受压迫的人，记念穷人。这就是他的意思。要知道你的骄傲是否已被谦卑，资产测试是你如何使用你的金钱。你知道，你可能会说，哦，是的，我相信一切都来自神。

这都是恩赐，但这里有资产测试。你对金钱慷慨吗？还是你表现得好像这一切都是你的？是你赚来的。想象一下，多年来人们告诉我什一奉献的想法，就是将10%奉献给穷人、教会和慈善机构的圣经观念是不合理的。

如果你转向某人说，我有麻烦了，我需要借钱。那个人说，多少钱？你说一万美元。我会全部还清的。那个人说，我告诉你，这里有一万美元。

我只要回一千美元。其余的都是礼物。你会说什么？多么不合理，难以置信，你居然想在这笔贷款中要回一千美元？不可思议。

你以为我是谁？不，你会说这是难以置信的恩典。但神看着你说，把你10%的钱给你周围的人。你却说这不合理。这证明在你心里，你仍然相信你是自己的作者。

这证明你还没有真正把自己看作是一个蒙恩得救的罪人，以至于一切，一切，一切都是恩赐。讽刺的是，除非你打破自己的第二种骄傲，否则你永远看不到自己。你永远不会得到第一种骄傲。还记得以索克·丹尼森谈到的那种骄傲吗？除非你看到你不能掌控自己的生命，你不是自己的作者，你永远不会看到他是你的作者。

因此你是一件艺术品。你是一个意外吗？你是一个白手起家的人吗？好的。那你就自由了。

你可以按照自己想要的方式生活。但你只是一个意外。你相信神所说的吗？是我创造了你？我是你的作者。

那么，在那种情况下

——某种意义上说，你并不掌管自己的人生。但现在，你成了一件艺术品。你知道艺术家是怎样看待自己的作品的吗？他们爱他们的作品，为它们劳碌，为它们流汗，甚至流血；他们珍惜自己的作品，疼爱自己的作品——上帝看你，也是这样。

你怎么会知道自己在神眼中是何等“美丽动人”？你怎么会拥有那种从被上帝所爱、被上帝看重而来的稳定与沉着？你只会在一个前提下得到：当你放手，不再掌控，而是对他说：“你才是作者。”

你要怎样活？走哪一条路？——“他能使行事骄傲的人降卑。”

让我们祷告：

父啊，当我们来到你的桌前，我们求你让我们既看见自己的罪，又看见你的怜悯，好使我们的骄傲得着医治。我们中间许多人正经历着自我中心带来的种种困难——老是拿自己和别人比较，老是受伤、敏感、玻璃心。哦主啊，求你帮助我们，把整个人生都看作礼物；帮助我们把艰难也看作你怜悯的一部分；帮助我们把物质上的一切都看成你赐给我们的礼物。

求你赐给我们那种轻松的喜乐、慷慨的心肠、不可思议的自信，因为我们知道自己不属于自己，而是属于这位创造宇宙的艺术家——我们是他手中的艺术品。当我们拿起饼和杯的时候，求你让我们懂得这一切。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
