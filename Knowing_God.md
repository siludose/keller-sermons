## English Transcript / 英文原文

today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel  because it is a power of God  that brings salvation to everyone who believes,  first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed,  a righteousness that is by faith,  from first to last, just as it is written,  the righteous will live by faith. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven  against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people  who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them,  because God has made it plain to them.

For since the creation of the world,  God's invisible qualities, his eternal power  and divine nature have been clearly seen,  being understood from what has been made,  so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God,  they neither glorified him as God,  nor gave thanks to him,  but their thinking became futile  and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord. So we are again in a fourth week of a series  we're doing called public faith,  sharing the hope that's within,  and each week in the small groups  we're talking about what we are talking about here  on a Sunday morning,  and we don't live in a society that encourages people  to be public about their religious faith  and their religious beliefs,  which is really ironic,  because we are encouraged in our society  to be public about everything else. We have to tell people who we are,  but think about it.

There's nothing more fundamental to your identity  and who you are than your religious beliefs. And therefore, if we're going to have a truly open  and pluralistic society,  we all have to learn how to be public  about who we are,  about our deepest faith beliefs,  and yet to do so in a way that's respectful to others  and promotes peace. And that's what we're exploring in these morning messages  in the small groups each week. Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God  and about God's existence? You're not going to be able to talk public about faith,  you can't talk about God in this existence,  but you go about that without getting into a shouting match  and it goes like this.

God does exist. No, God doesn't exist. That's the internet right there, you know? And sometimes actually out on this street,  I think one of the ways to make people more reflective  is to not ask the question, does God exist,  but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists?

How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not,  how do you know that? See, as soon as you start to ask the question,  how do you know whether there's a God,  or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God? It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more. And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question.

How can you know whether there's a God or not,  than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1,  written by St. Paul. I don't think there's any more brilliant and ingenious answer to the question. How can we know whether there's a God or not than here? Because Paul actually gives you four answers,  pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all.

Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God. We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God.

We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way,  and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here. Let's take a look. First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God.

So for example, the famous verses,  they're all famous, 19 and 20. What may be known about God is plain,  for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made. Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world. There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence.

He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence  from what you see in nature. Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people  have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs. And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world,  you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook,  they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature  and the created order are proofs,  they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them,  then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument,  and there's the teleological argument. Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in.

A proof is something that no rational person can deny. No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it. And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties,  of our hearts and minds were in better condition,  we would acknowledge those clues more readily. But they're there.

What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much. He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power  are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute,  just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

The cosmological argument works like this. How could something come from nothing? That's it. So for example, you know, the big bang theory,  the universe started with a bang. How could nothing have exploded?

You know, nothing can't explode. So how could the explosion come from nothing? Well, somebody says, well, it wasn't that there was nothing. There was something. Okay, but where'd that something come from?

And as soon as you keep asking that question,  where did that something come from? It came from that, where did that something come from? And if you go all the way back to say, well,  there was something that had no cause,  that it didn't come from nothing,  it was always there since we know nothing in this world like that. Everything we know has a beginning. Everything we know is an effect with a cause.

As soon as you start talking about an uncaused cause,  as soon as you start talking about something that has no,  there was always there,  you're talking about something supernatural. Say, something that we don't know here in nature,  something beyond nature, something divine. And see, that's how the cosmological argument goes. And says, how could all this come from nothing? And if it didn't come from nothing, then what brought it about?

The teleological argument is actually kind of fun, too. And again, I'm looking at my watch. They're just fun. If they're not enough to make people believe in God,  they haven't. But they are there, the clues are there.

The teleological argument comes from the word telos,  which means design. And it talks about the fact that the world is so perfectly designed,  how could it have come about by accident? Now the physicist will tell you this,  and I have to look at my notes just to say it right,  that the fundamental regularities and constants of physics,  things like speed of light, gravitational constant,  the strength of weak and strong nuclear forces,  all of these things have to be perfectly calibrated. It's almost like there are a hundred dials,  and every single dial has to be exactly at the right spot,  not a single one can be off a hair. They all have to be so perfectly calibrated in such a way  for matter to coalesce, unless all those things were exactly  the way they are, we wouldn't have matter,  we wouldn't have a world, we wouldn't have human life.

And so what many people have said is,  so many things had to happen exactly the way they are,  whether it even be human life, even to be life,  even to be matter, that couldn't happen by accident. So God did it. That's the teleological argument. Now people like Richard Dawkins or Stephen Hawking,  who are atheists, spend a lot of time refuting that argument,  and you know what that means? It means it must have force or they wouldn't spend the time.

But you know what they all say? What Dawkins says, you know what Stephen Hawking says? What they say is that at the big bang,  there could have been an infinite number of possible universes formed,  and we just happen to be in the universe where matter coalesces,  where all the various fundamental regularities and constants of physics  are exactly the way they ought to be for life to happen. So there we are. There's an resilience and resilience of those universes  and we just happen to be in the one where it happens.

And of course there's a lot of philosophers have a lot of fun with that. I'm going to just give you one. John Leslie is a philosopher that tells you this story. John Leslie tells you this story. He says, imagine there's a man about to be executed.

And so this sergeant gets 50 crack marksmen  and lines them up six feet from the prisoner. And so 50 crack marksmen with their rifles,  six feet from the prisoner, ready, aim, fire. And they all miss. The sergeant says, what happened? Every single man says, gosh, serge, I just had a twitch my nose,  you know, something in my eye, you know, I'm sorry, all 50 at once.

And the sergeant says it can't hold me with 50 at once. And then one guy who took a philosophy course says,  but sergeant at the big bang,  there could have been a zillions of possible universes formed. And we just happened to be in the universe  where all 50 crack marksmen happened to, you know,  have a twitch in their nose at the very same moment. Now, you know, first of all, the sergeant,  if he also took a philosophy course,  he would have to say, you're right, I can't prove that this was a conspiracy. Because we just happened to maybe be in the one universe, right?

I can't prove it, but I know it was a conspiracy. I would never, in a million years,  it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that we just happened to be in the one universe  where all that can happen. I want you to assume it's a conspiracy. That it was as somebody did it. That it was contrived, that there was some personal action,  there was some personal design involved, right?

He wouldn't assume the one in a zillion chance happened. He would assume it was a personal design. And for you to say, there's a one in a zillion chance that maybe there is no God. Does that make sense to base your entire life on that? So these are the cosmological and teleological arguments.

And these are basically forms of the kinds of clues that people have seen over the years. And Paul says they're there. They're really our clues. But Paul says something much more radical than that. A lot more radical.

Because he doesn't just say it's possible to know God by looking at nature. He actually goes a little beyond that, way beyond that,  and says every human being actually does know God. See where he says that? He says God is mad. And why is he mad?

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people. This is everybody, humanity, who suppress the truth. What truth? What is known, may be known about God. And then down in verse 21, he says, for although they knew God,  they wouldn't glorify Him as God.

What he is saying is people, all people are suppressing the truth about God's existence. Now you can't suppress something unless you've got it. And what he's saying is at some very deep level, every human being knows that God is there. Now this, by the way, is a very offensive statement to people. In fact, just in the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times yesterday,  there was a letter to the editor.

The letter to the editor had to do with some op-ed piece that I happen to miss. But some op-ed person had said this term in one of the op-ed pieces earlier this week  that there are no atheists and foxholes. You've heard that. That when the shooting begins and even the atheist show that they actually believe in God,  well, one atheist wrote in and he was very offended and is what he said. And this is fair.

He says, quote, he says, the implication that atheists are all really theists at heart  and that our convictions are casually and shadowly held  and easily abandoned in the face of adversity is simply untrue. He says to say, he's an atheist. He says to say that I'm really a theist at heart and my atheism, my beliefs, our convictions,  are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned. He just isn't true. Well, see Paul is not saying anything like that.

Here's what Paul is saying. Yes, Paul is saying that it's some level everybody knows there's a God. But as we're going to see in a minute, he's also saying at a profound level,  everybody, we all believe in God yet we don't believe in God. And what's interesting, the translators can never get this right  because it's a very awkward construction. But Paul deliberately, when he says, what may be known about God, is plain to them.

For since the creation of the world's invisible qualities,  eternal power, have been clearly seen, being understood,  the verbs there are present passive participles in Greek. And what it means is, and this is what the commentators say,  what it means is that the reality of God bears down on us constantly. That is that there's part of our heart that doesn't believe God's there  and yet there's another part of our heart that's sensitive to his reality  and that reality bears down on us. So what Paul is describing is a deeply conflicted dialogue between the part of our hearts  that denies the existence of God and the part of our hearts that's sensitive to his reality. There's nothing casual or shallow about that.

And yet Paul is saying that at some level, in some part of our heart, we know God's there. Now you say, what's the evidence for that? See, we're not talking here, you can look at the arguments for God and infer his existence. We're saying, Paul is saying that all people already know about his existence. At some level, they know he's there.

Well, what's the evidence for that? I have, after many, many years of finding it interesting to read the biographies  of atheists who have become Christians. I see what Paul is talking about. There's a whole slew of prominent, some more famous than others,  British intellectuals who are atheists and who became Christians. I mean, some of them are more famous like T.S.

Eliot, W.H. Auden, I see a slew. Some are a little less famous like C.E.M. Joan, A.N. Wilson.

People like they all have initials, lots of initials there. But a lot of these were British intellectuals, brilliant men,  and they were biographers in literary critics and thinkers and that sort of thing in poets. And even though they had rejected Christianity growing up and they became part of the intellectual elites,  all of whom laughed at religion and Christianity, they shocked their contemporaries and their peers  by embracing Christianity in one form or another. When I look at them and I study them, I see that very seldom, if ever,  do they look at the evidence like the cosmologic argument and the teleological argument  and they come to conclude, I guess there's a God. Rather, when they talk about how they found faith, they come to say,  they come to see that they believed God all along, they were living as if there was a God.

They weren't admitting that they were living as if there was a God  and they finally admitted he's got to be there. Very interesting. Let me just give you two. One is not as interesting and not as well known as the other. A.N.

Wilson, he's more recent. A.N. Wilson was a... Kathy, I know him because he really turned on Christianity  and he wrote a terrible biography of C.S. Lewis, basically attacking him for his beliefs.

He wrote biographies of Jesus of Paul, he was very skeptical of Christianity, rejected it,  very brilliant man, but on Easter 2009 he put an article in the paper said,  I have embraced Christianity, just shocked everybody and gave an Easter testimony. And in it, this is what he said, he says most public voices he's talking about in Britain. Most public voices have accepted the idea that only stupid people actually believe in Christianity. As a matter of fact, it's materialist atheism that is not merely an arid creed but is totally irrational. For materialist atheism says, we are just a collection of chemicals.

It has no answer whatsoever to the question of how we should be capable of love or heroism  or poetry if we are simply animated pieces of meat. And he goes on and tries to say, he says, people who believe there is no God  and that we are just... what he called us, we're just bags of chemicals  and animated pieces of meat that have evolved. Then we say we need to be noble and we need to believe in justice  and we need to love each other and he says there's no basis for that. Now you say where does that come from? Let me give you a second case study because it's a little clearer and more fascinating.

W.H. Auden, a poet, was considered one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. What's interesting to me is that his conversion happened right here in the Upper East Side years ago. He was British but he was living in America during World War II and he had embraced atheism  just like everybody in his intellectual class. But it started evidently when he was... you know that just the northern part of the Upper East Side,  sort of the north eastern part of the Upper East Side, Yorkville was back in World War II  and in the 30s and 40s a very, very German place.

Lots and lots of German people lived here. And there were a lot of... in fact, when we got here to start the church,  there were still lots and lots of German-speaking churches and restaurants and places like that  still in the late 80s up in the Upper East Side largely vanished. But during the 40s W.H. Auden went to... he was working on his German actually  and there were a number of German cinemas, places that show German films. And he went into a film house somewhere in the late 30s and saw a film that obviously had been influenced by Nazism  and he saw... he saw American Jew...

German people, American... German American people,  these Germans living in America, yelling at the screen slurs against the Jews that appeared in this story. And it shook him. And eventually this is what he wrote. He came back to Christianity, shocked everybody and this is what he wrote.

Let me set this up for you because it's very important. Auden thought that all educated and lightened people would believe in freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. Basically believe that all educated people, all cultured people, you know, all reasonable people,  people who believed in the importance of human reason and who are cultured,  that they would believe in the values of freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. What happened was that Germany had embraced Nazism and Germany was second to none as a sophisticated, educated society,  tremendous science, tremendous music, tremendous art, scholarship. You know Germany was second to none and yet they had embraced the idea that you should... well, that loving your neighbor and justice and human rights was a fiction.

So this is what Odin wrote. It created a crisis for him and here's what he wrote. If I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated in Hitler have no heaven to cry to. The whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine faith in the absolute.

It is tried to make reason the judge. But either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitler monster will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. And here's what he means. He says he believed in human rights liberty and freedom. Why?

Why should you believe in human rights and freedom? Why? Especially, let's use your reason, huh? And let's look at nature. But what you see, when you look at nature, reason looks at nature.

It's science and empirical. What do you see? You see the strong eating the weak. That's nature. That's how you got here.

The strong eating the weak. So now on what basis do you see a strong country eating a weak country or a strong race eating a weaker race, you know, destroying a pressing mark, on what basis do you say that's wrong? What reason? See, you're just using your reason, not morality, not heaven, not moral absence, just your reason. How do you decide that human freedom and dignity and human rights and justice for all?

Why believe that when that's not how nature works? He says Hitler was using reason. And reason is, hey, we're products of evolution. And so here's basically what he says. Yeah.

Of course, without God, you can have moral feelings. Oh, listen carefully, everybody. Without God, you can have moral feelings. Sure. You can feel it's wrong to oppress people.

You can feel human rights are right, okay? But without God, there can be no moral obligation. That is you have no right to say that your moral feelings should determine them, their behavior. See, you have moral feelings, your English, they have moral feelings, they're Nazis and they're Germans. How dare you say that your moral feelings are right and there's a wrong?

When there's no standard. And therefore, here's what he decided, if you believe that human rights and justice are not imaginary values, but are real. And if there is no God, they would be imaginary, but they're not imaginary. Therefore, there must be a God. Without God, there can be moral feelings, but there can't be moral obligation.

You can't say you are obliged to follow my moral feelings. But if you believe, well, they genocide is wrong. Oppression is wrong. Human rights are right. They're not just my feelings.

They're right. There must be a God. And Auden realized he was believing God all along. He just wasn't being honest with himself. We know there's a God.

Deep down. We suppress it. But that's the third point. See, the other thing that is so brilliant about Paul's analysis is, is the human condition. We can know God.

And we do know there's a God. And yet, we don't know there's a God. See, when he says, in the very moment he says, we do know God. He also says, we suppress it. We repress it.

So we don't know it. And yet we do know it. And yet we don't know it. And both are fundamentally the same. I mean, they're equally strong.

Now, what kind of stuff do we modern people know? We tend to suppress or repress. Why do you suppress something? Why do you repress something? If it's traumatic.

Now, sometimes memories can be traumatic. One of my favorite Agatha Christie novels is Sleeping Murder. And it's about a young woman who buys a house. And in the house she starts to have flashbacks of a murder she saw. And it turns out that as a little girl, she was in the house and she'd repress the memories of a murder.

And that's how the murder works. Now, the fact is that psychologists will tell you that there's really probably not that many truly repressed memories that are traumatic. I mean, there's a lot of fiction about it and there are a lot of people talk about it in the media. But the reality is it's probably not true that some memories are so traumatic. We simply repress them.

It's pretty rare. But I'll tell you what you do repress. If you're really angry, you can repress that. No, I'm not that angry. If you're really feeling guilty about something you've done, you can repress that.

No, I don't really feel guilty. Anything about your heart that doesn't fit in with your identity, your way that you'd like to think about who you are. So you have a chosen identity. I like to think of myself as this or as this or this. And when data comes in, things that you've done or feelings you've got that doesn't fit that data, you screen it out, you suppress it, you repress it.

And Paul says that's exactly what we're doing with God. Why? Because the knowledge of God is incredibly traumatic. So it tells you right here, verse 21, key verse. For although they knew God, they didn't glorify God.

And what's glorify me? They didn't treat God as as big and as glorious as He truly is, as multi-dimensional, as great, as magnificent as He is. Why? Because they didn't want to thank Him. Now you might say, what?

That's the big sin. That's the whole problem. We don't want to thank God. Yeah. By the way, even at the legal level, there's this thing called plagiarism.

What's plagiarism? For refusing to thank somebody, for the intellectual property you're ripping off, refusing to thank somebody saying, and I want to acknowledge that I got all these ideas from so we don't say that. Why? Because then we are showing our dependence and showing our obligation and showing we may actually not have complete control over what we're saying. But you see, if there's a God, then we are utterly dependent on Him.

And we are totally obliged to Him. See, if there's a God who made us and keeps us alive every second, then that's traumatic because it means we need to thank Him for everything, which means there's not a single spot in your life that you don't owe Him allegiance. And we hate that. Because our image of who we are is that we can call the shots. We are our own masters.

We decide what is right or wrong, especially our Western culture tells us that. And so along comes the God of the Bible in particular. And there is no God that's more traumatic than the God of the Bible. Why? Well, see, what if you say, well, I believe in a God of love, just a God that's a spirit of love everywhere.

See, that does not get in the first way. You don't have to thank that person, do you? That's not a person. You're still in control. You can still live with the illusion that you're in charge of your life.

Or if you believe there's other kinds of God, I just believe that God is the force of life and everything. There's all sorts of ways of believing in God that are traumatic and that we embrace, but the God of the Bible or put it like this. Imagine you had this really great scam going. There was a neighborhood in New York City that you go to and you dress up as a police officer. You impersonate a police officer.

And the waters park when you go there and they, you know, people give you free sandwiches and they. Top of the morning to you officer and you know, everything goes really nicely. Now, while you're, while you're impersonating the police officer, you'll probably be a little nervous. You'll be a little afraid that maybe you'll say something that might make, you know, somebody say, what, why would a police officer say this? You're a little nervous, of course, because you're impersonating an officer.

But what if in the distance coming walking towards you, you see a real police officer. You're not just nervous now. You're scared. Why? Because there's no chance that the real police officer is going to expose you as an impersonator.

It will happen. Therefore, all human beings, according to Paul, we want to call the shots. We want to be our own bosses. We want to be in control of our lives. We want to take credit.

So that's cosmic plagiarism. We want to take credit for who we are and what we've done. We want to pat ourselves on the back in all those ways. What are we doing? We're impersonating a god.

We're impersonating a creator. You know, we're self-made people and we're worshiping our creator. But what happens? See, when somebody comes along, says, I believe in a god who kind of made the world and now he's off in the, he's a remote or somebody says, I believe in a nature, a god who is nature, I believe in this, I believe. There's a whole lot of gods that actually don't threaten you.

But when you get to the biblical god who creates you and sustains you who is a glorious god and who you to whom you owe everything, that is a god who's going to freak you out. You're going to melt down. That's like when you're impersonating a police officer and you see a real police officer coming, you're impersonating a god. And when you see the real god coming, the biblical god coming, you go nuts. And Paul says, that's the reason why even though we know there's a god and we actually, in some ways, live as if there's a god.

We were honest with ourselves. We can't not know that there's a god. It presses his reality presses on us all the time. At the same time, we desperately do not want to believe in God. Everybody in this room, including the guy behind the microphone right now, it says, suppresses the truth to some degree.

None of us can bear the full reality of who God is. It's too threatening. It's too traumatic. We all try to whittle God down somehow, flatten him. But the biblical god, very traumatic.

And so though we can know God and we do know God, we don't know God. Well, what do we do about it? What can we do about it? Well, there actually is clues here as to what we can do about it and how we can truly know the god who's really there, how we can heal ourselves of our fears so that we can know him truly. And what is that?

Well, let me put it like this. This in some ways gets into the rest of the book of Romans and we're not looking at the whole book of Romans. But let me show you, let's go back to verse 1920 for a minute and say, if you look at nature, he says, if you look at creation, if you look at the things that have been made, what can you learn about God? He's invisible. He's eternal.

He's powerful. He's divine. Okay. What's missing from the list? Is there anything there that it says you can't know about God just by looking at nature, just by using your reason, just by using all your rational powers, by trying to be objective?

No matter how hard you try, looking at the things that are made, there's one thing you're not going to know anything about. What is it? Does anything about his love or his grace? And probably that's true. Let's look at nature class.

Let's look at a geologically. Oh, look at the volcanoes. Look at the earthquakes. Do you just look at that and just say, I just see that God is a God of love. No.

Let's look at the nature meteorologically. Hurricanes, see, you know, tsunamis. Do you just look at nature and say, you just, I just know God is a God of love. Let's look at it astronomically. You know, we're in a galaxy.

Our galaxy is just, you know, zillions and zillions of miles wide. We, and there are 100 billion galaxies we even know of, and we only probably know of a tiny amount of how many there really are. And do you look at that and the idea that there's a God who made all that, you just look at that and say, oh, I just really want to know a God like that. No, you're scared to death. If there is a God that made all that, what am I?

Let's look at it biologically. You know, Annie Dillard wrote a great book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and went out to live, you know, in the mountains of Virginia years ago. She won a Pulitzer Prize for the book, and she said, I wanted to observe nature. So she watched at the creek. She watched nature.

She thought it would make her close to nature, and she saw how violent nature was. She saw a giant water bug sting and paralyze a frog, and then put its thing down into its brain and suck its brains out until it sort of collapsed like a piece of clothing with nobody in it. And she said, oh, nature. Do you look at nature, read and tooth and claw, and say, oh, I just know God is a God of love. No, you will not find that God is a God of love.

In fact, now this is a little more controversial. I'm going to take 20 seconds on it. I promise I can back it up, but I'll just tell you, do you look at other religions? And say, well, other religions all say God is a God of love. No, you go to Buddhism.

They talk about being compassionate if you're a Buddhist. Of course, but it's because this world is unreal, and you shouldn't grab hold of anything. And the idea is that God is an impersonal soul, and we're going to become impersonal souls. No, they don't believe God is a God of love. In fact, if you talk to Islam, you say, do you believe your God is a God of love?

They'll talk about being merciful, but I know with many, many Muslims I've talked to is God a God of love. They said, no, we wouldn't say that. So where do you get this idea that God is a God of love? It's so pervasive in the world. I'll tell you where you get the idea.

It comes from the Bible. That's the only source in human thought. But if you really don't just pull what you want out of the Bible and really find the biblical God, here's what you see. Verse 18, wrath. A wrathful God, a God who gets angry at sin, a God who gets incredibly angry at sin.

And a little later on in Romans 3, it'll say, in the wages of sin is death. Wrath, demanding death because we disobey him. And then yet, look, verse 16, 17, but I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. See, first the Jew, the good person, then the Gentile, the pagan person, it doesn't matter.

For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed. A righteousness is not earned, not something that you develop, but is given as a gift. It's by faith, from first to last. And you will live by it. Now here's the point.

When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control. You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great.

It's great. Why? Because the other person loses control, too. You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God.

A God of love. Yeah, you know what? You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control. And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are.

That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating. But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control.

Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit. He's nailed. He loses complete control.

Why? He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death. In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control.

So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us. Now, what is that? That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that.

No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to. The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself. There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God.

Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid. And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you. It's just too great.

Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you. It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross. And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says. That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers.

What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes. Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes.

My humiliation? Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot. I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death. That's wrong.

It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die. For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ. The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was.

But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself?

Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love? That was Father Martin's answer.

Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God. In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord. Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are.

We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel  because it is a power of God  that brings salvation to everyone who believes,  first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed,  a righteousness that is by faith,  from first to last, just as it is written,  the righteous will live by faith. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven  against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people  who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them,  because God has made it plain to them.

For since the creation of the world,  God's invisible qualities, his eternal power  and divine nature have been clearly seen,  being understood from what has been made,  so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God,  they neither glorified him as God,  nor gave thanks to him,  but their thinking became futile  and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord. So we are again in a fourth week of a series  we're doing called public faith,  sharing the hope that's within,  and each week in the small groups  we're talking about what we are talking about here  on a Sunday morning,  and we don't live in a society that encourages people  to be public about their religious faith  and their religious beliefs,  which is really ironic,  because we are encouraged in our society  to be public about everything else. We have to tell people who we are,  but think about it.

There's nothing more fundamental to your identity  and who you are than your religious beliefs. And therefore, if we're going to have a truly open  and pluralistic society,  we all have to learn how to be public  about who we are,  about our deepest faith beliefs,  and yet to do so in a way that's respectful to others  and promotes peace. And that's what we're exploring in these morning messages  in the small groups each week. Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God  and about God's existence? You're not going to be able to talk public about faith,  you can't talk about God in this existence,  but you go about that without getting into a shouting match  and it goes like this.

God does exist. No, God doesn't exist. That's the internet right there, you know? And sometimes actually out on this street,  I think one of the ways to make people more reflective  is to not ask the question, does God exist,  but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists?

How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not,  how do you know that? See, as soon as you start to ask the question,  how do you know whether there's a God,  or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God? It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more. And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question.

How can you know whether there's a God or not,  than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1,  written by St. Paul. I don't think there's any more brilliant and ingenious answer to the question. How can we know whether there's a God or not than here? Because Paul actually gives you four answers,  pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all.

Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God. We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God.

We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way,  and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here. Let's take a look. First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God.

So for example, the famous verses,  they're all famous, 19 and 20. What may be known about God is plain,  for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made. Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world. There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence.

He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence  from what you see in nature. Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people  have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs. And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world,  you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook,  they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature  and the created order are proofs,  they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them,  then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument,  and there's the teleological argument. Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in.

A proof is something that no rational person can deny. No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it. And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties,  of our hearts and minds were in better condition,  we would acknowledge those clues more readily. But they're there.

What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much. He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power  are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute,  just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

The cosmological argument works like this. How could something come from nothing? That's it. So for example, you know, the big bang theory,  the universe started with a bang. How could nothing have exploded?

You know, nothing can't explode. So how could the explosion come from nothing? Well, somebody says, well, it wasn't that there was nothing. There was something. Okay, but where'd that something come from?

And as soon as you keep asking that question,  where did that something come from? It came from that, where did that something come from? And if you go all the way back to say, well,  there was something that had no cause,  that it didn't come from nothing,  it was always there since we know nothing in this world like that. Everything we know has a beginning. Everything we know is an effect with a cause.

As soon as you start talking about an uncaused cause,  as soon as you start talking about something that has no,  there was always there,  you're talking about something supernatural. Say, something that we don't know here in nature,  something beyond nature, something divine. And see, that's how the cosmological argument goes. And says, how could all this come from nothing? And if it didn't come from nothing, then what brought it about?

The teleological argument is actually kind of fun, too. And again, I'm looking at my watch. They're just fun. If they're not enough to make people believe in God,  they haven't. But they are there, the clues are there.

The teleological argument comes from the word telos,  which means design. And it talks about the fact that the world is so perfectly designed,  how could it have come about by accident? Now the physicist will tell you this,  and I have to look at my notes just to say it right,  that the fundamental regularities and constants of physics,  things like speed of light, gravitational constant,  the strength of weak and strong nuclear forces,  all of these things have to be perfectly calibrated. It's almost like there are a hundred dials,  and every single dial has to be exactly at the right spot,  not a single one can be off a hair. They all have to be so perfectly calibrated in such a way  for matter to coalesce, unless all those things were exactly  the way they are, we wouldn't have matter,  we wouldn't have a world, we wouldn't have human life.

And so what many people have said is,  so many things had to happen exactly the way they are,  whether it even be human life, even to be life,  even to be matter, that couldn't happen by accident. So God did it. That's the teleological argument. Now people like Richard Dawkins or Stephen Hawking,  who are atheists, spend a lot of time refuting that argument,  and you know what that means? It means it must have force or they wouldn't spend the time.

But you know what they all say? What Dawkins says, you know what Stephen Hawking says? What they say is that at the big bang,  there could have been an infinite number of possible universes formed,  and we just happen to be in the universe where matter coalesces,  where all the various fundamental regularities and constants of physics  are exactly the way they ought to be for life to happen. So there we are. There's an resilience and resilience of those universes  and we just happen to be in the one where it happens.

And of course there's a lot of philosophers have a lot of fun with that. I'm going to just give you one. John Leslie is a philosopher that tells you this story. John Leslie tells you this story. He says, imagine there's a man about to be executed.

And so this sergeant gets 50 crack marksmen  and lines them up six feet from the prisoner. And so 50 crack marksmen with their rifles,  six feet from the prisoner, ready, aim, fire. And they all miss. The sergeant says, what happened? Every single man says, gosh, serge, I just had a twitch my nose,  you know, something in my eye, you know, I'm sorry, all 50 at once.

And the sergeant says it can't hold me with 50 at once. And then one guy who took a philosophy course says,  but sergeant at the big bang,  there could have been a zillions of possible universes formed. And we just happened to be in the universe  where all 50 crack marksmen happened to, you know,  have a twitch in their nose at the very same moment. Now, you know, first of all, the sergeant,  if he also took a philosophy course,  he would have to say, you're right, I can't prove that this was a conspiracy. Because we just happened to maybe be in the one universe, right?

I can't prove it, but I know it was a conspiracy. I would never, in a million years,  it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that we just happened to be in the one universe  where all that can happen. I want you to assume it's a conspiracy. That it was as somebody did it. That it was contrived, that there was some personal action,  there was some personal design involved, right?

He wouldn't assume the one in a zillion chance happened. He would assume it was a personal design. And for you to say, there's a one in a zillion chance that maybe there is no God. Does that make sense to base your entire life on that? So these are the cosmological and teleological arguments.

And these are basically forms of the kinds of clues that people have seen over the years. And Paul says they're there. They're really our clues. But Paul says something much more radical than that. A lot more radical.

Because he doesn't just say it's possible to know God by looking at nature. He actually goes a little beyond that, way beyond that,  and says every human being actually does know God. See where he says that? He says God is mad. And why is he mad?

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people. This is everybody, humanity, who suppress the truth. What truth? What is known, may be known about God. And then down in verse 21, he says, for although they knew God,  they wouldn't glorify Him as God.

What he is saying is people, all people are suppressing the truth about God's existence. Now you can't suppress something unless you've got it. And what he's saying is at some very deep level, every human being knows that God is there. Now this, by the way, is a very offensive statement to people. In fact, just in the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times yesterday,  there was a letter to the editor.

The letter to the editor had to do with some op-ed piece that I happen to miss. But some op-ed person had said this term in one of the op-ed pieces earlier this week  that there are no atheists and foxholes. You've heard that. That when the shooting begins and even the atheist show that they actually believe in God,  well, one atheist wrote in and he was very offended and is what he said. And this is fair.

He says, quote, he says, the implication that atheists are all really theists at heart  and that our convictions are casually and shadowly held  and easily abandoned in the face of adversity is simply untrue. He says to say, he's an atheist. He says to say that I'm really a theist at heart and my atheism, my beliefs, our convictions,  are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned. He just isn't true. Well, see Paul is not saying anything like that.

Here's what Paul is saying. Yes, Paul is saying that it's some level everybody knows there's a God. But as we're going to see in a minute, he's also saying at a profound level,  everybody, we all believe in God yet we don't believe in God. And what's interesting, the translators can never get this right  because it's a very awkward construction. But Paul deliberately, when he says, what may be known about God, is plain to them.

For since the creation of the world's invisible qualities,  eternal power, have been clearly seen, being understood,  the verbs there are present passive participles in Greek. And what it means is, and this is what the commentators say,  what it means is that the reality of God bears down on us constantly. That is that there's part of our heart that doesn't believe God's there  and yet there's another part of our heart that's sensitive to his reality  and that reality bears down on us. So what Paul is describing is a deeply conflicted dialogue between the part of our hearts  that denies the existence of God and the part of our hearts that's sensitive to his reality. There's nothing casual or shallow about that.

And yet Paul is saying that at some level, in some part of our heart, we know God's there. Now you say, what's the evidence for that? See, we're not talking here, you can look at the arguments for God and infer his existence. We're saying, Paul is saying that all people already know about his existence. At some level, they know he's there.

Well, what's the evidence for that? I have, after many, many years of finding it interesting to read the biographies  of atheists who have become Christians. I see what Paul is talking about. There's a whole slew of prominent, some more famous than others,  British intellectuals who are atheists and who became Christians. I mean, some of them are more famous like T.S.

Eliot, W.H. Auden, I see a slew. Some are a little less famous like C.E.M. Joan, A.N. Wilson.

People like they all have initials, lots of initials there. But a lot of these were British intellectuals, brilliant men,  and they were biographers in literary critics and thinkers and that sort of thing in poets. And even though they had rejected Christianity growing up and they became part of the intellectual elites,  all of whom laughed at religion and Christianity, they shocked their contemporaries and their peers  by embracing Christianity in one form or another. When I look at them and I study them, I see that very seldom, if ever,  do they look at the evidence like the cosmologic argument and the teleological argument  and they come to conclude, I guess there's a God. Rather, when they talk about how they found faith, they come to say,  they come to see that they believed God all along, they were living as if there was a God.

They weren't admitting that they were living as if there was a God  and they finally admitted he's got to be there. Very interesting. Let me just give you two. One is not as interesting and not as well known as the other. A.N.

Wilson, he's more recent. A.N. Wilson was a... Kathy, I know him because he really turned on Christianity  and he wrote a terrible biography of C.S. Lewis, basically attacking him for his beliefs.

He wrote biographies of Jesus of Paul, he was very skeptical of Christianity, rejected it,  very brilliant man, but on Easter 2009 he put an article in the paper said,  I have embraced Christianity, just shocked everybody and gave an Easter testimony. And in it, this is what he said, he says most public voices he's talking about in Britain. Most public voices have accepted the idea that only stupid people actually believe in Christianity. As a matter of fact, it's materialist atheism that is not merely an arid creed but is totally irrational. For materialist atheism says, we are just a collection of chemicals.

It has no answer whatsoever to the question of how we should be capable of love or heroism  or poetry if we are simply animated pieces of meat. And he goes on and tries to say, he says, people who believe there is no God  and that we are just... what he called us, we're just bags of chemicals  and animated pieces of meat that have evolved. Then we say we need to be noble and we need to believe in justice  and we need to love each other and he says there's no basis for that. Now you say where does that come from? Let me give you a second case study because it's a little clearer and more fascinating.

W.H. Auden, a poet, was considered one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. What's interesting to me is that his conversion happened right here in the Upper East Side years ago. He was British but he was living in America during World War II and he had embraced atheism  just like everybody in his intellectual class. But it started evidently when he was... you know that just the northern part of the Upper East Side,  sort of the north eastern part of the Upper East Side, Yorkville was back in World War II  and in the 30s and 40s a very, very German place.

Lots and lots of German people lived here. And there were a lot of... in fact, when we got here to start the church,  there were still lots and lots of German-speaking churches and restaurants and places like that  still in the late 80s up in the Upper East Side largely vanished. But during the 40s W.H. Auden went to... he was working on his German actually  and there were a number of German cinemas, places that show German films. And he went into a film house somewhere in the late 30s and saw a film that obviously had been influenced by Nazism  and he saw... he saw American Jew...

German people, American... German American people,  these Germans living in America, yelling at the screen slurs against the Jews that appeared in this story. And it shook him. And eventually this is what he wrote. He came back to Christianity, shocked everybody and this is what he wrote.

Let me set this up for you because it's very important. Auden thought that all educated and lightened people would believe in freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. Basically believe that all educated people, all cultured people, you know, all reasonable people,  people who believed in the importance of human reason and who are cultured,  that they would believe in the values of freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. What happened was that Germany had embraced Nazism and Germany was second to none as a sophisticated, educated society,  tremendous science, tremendous music, tremendous art, scholarship. You know Germany was second to none and yet they had embraced the idea that you should... well, that loving your neighbor and justice and human rights was a fiction.

So this is what Odin wrote. It created a crisis for him and here's what he wrote. If I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated in Hitler have no heaven to cry to. The whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine faith in the absolute.

It is tried to make reason the judge. But either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitler monster will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. And here's what he means. He says he believed in human rights liberty and freedom. Why?

Why should you believe in human rights and freedom? Why? Especially, let's use your reason, huh? And let's look at nature. But what you see, when you look at nature, reason looks at nature.

It's science and empirical. What do you see? You see the strong eating the weak. That's nature. That's how you got here.

The strong eating the weak. So now on what basis do you see a strong country eating a weak country or a strong race eating a weaker race, you know, destroying a pressing mark, on what basis do you say that's wrong? What reason? See, you're just using your reason, not morality, not heaven, not moral absence, just your reason. How do you decide that human freedom and dignity and human rights and justice for all?

Why believe that when that's not how nature works? He says Hitler was using reason. And reason is, hey, we're products of evolution. And so here's basically what he says. Yeah.

Of course, without God, you can have moral feelings. Oh, listen carefully, everybody. Without God, you can have moral feelings. Sure. You can feel it's wrong to oppress people.

You can feel human rights are right, okay? But without God, there can be no moral obligation. That is you have no right to say that your moral feelings should determine them, their behavior. See, you have moral feelings, your English, they have moral feelings, they're Nazis and they're Germans. How dare you say that your moral feelings are right and there's a wrong?

When there's no standard. And therefore, here's what he decided, if you believe that human rights and justice are not imaginary values, but are real. And if there is no God, they would be imaginary, but they're not imaginary. Therefore, there must be a God. Without God, there can be moral feelings, but there can't be moral obligation.

You can't say you are obliged to follow my moral feelings. But if you believe, well, they genocide is wrong. Oppression is wrong. Human rights are right. They're not just my feelings.

They're right. There must be a God. And Auden realized he was believing God all along. He just wasn't being honest with himself. We know there's a God.

Deep down. We suppress it. But that's the third point. See, the other thing that is so brilliant about Paul's analysis is, is the human condition. We can know God.

And we do know there's a God. And yet, we don't know there's a God. See, when he says, in the very moment he says, we do know God. He also says, we suppress it. We repress it.

So we don't know it. And yet we do know it. And yet we don't know it. And both are fundamentally the same. I mean, they're equally strong.

Now, what kind of stuff do we modern people know? We tend to suppress or repress. Why do you suppress something? Why do you repress something? If it's traumatic.

Now, sometimes memories can be traumatic. One of my favorite Agatha Christie novels is Sleeping Murder. And it's about a young woman who buys a house. And in the house she starts to have flashbacks of a murder she saw. And it turns out that as a little girl, she was in the house and she'd repress the memories of a murder.

And that's how the murder works. Now, the fact is that psychologists will tell you that there's really probably not that many truly repressed memories that are traumatic. I mean, there's a lot of fiction about it and there are a lot of people talk about it in the media. But the reality is it's probably not true that some memories are so traumatic. We simply repress them.

It's pretty rare. But I'll tell you what you do repress. If you're really angry, you can repress that. No, I'm not that angry. If you're really feeling guilty about something you've done, you can repress that.

No, I don't really feel guilty. Anything about your heart that doesn't fit in with your identity, your way that you'd like to think about who you are. So you have a chosen identity. I like to think of myself as this or as this or this. And when data comes in, things that you've done or feelings you've got that doesn't fit that data, you screen it out, you suppress it, you repress it.

And Paul says that's exactly what we're doing with God. Why? Because the knowledge of God is incredibly traumatic. So it tells you right here, verse 21, key verse. For although they knew God, they didn't glorify God.

And what's glorify me? They didn't treat God as as big and as glorious as He truly is, as multi-dimensional, as great, as magnificent as He is. Why? Because they didn't want to thank Him. Now you might say, what?

That's the big sin. That's the whole problem. We don't want to thank God. Yeah. By the way, even at the legal level, there's this thing called plagiarism.

What's plagiarism? For refusing to thank somebody, for the intellectual property you're ripping off, refusing to thank somebody saying, and I want to acknowledge that I got all these ideas from so we don't say that. Why? Because then we are showing our dependence and showing our obligation and showing we may actually not have complete control over what we're saying. But you see, if there's a God, then we are utterly dependent on Him.

And we are totally obliged to Him. See, if there's a God who made us and keeps us alive every second, then that's traumatic because it means we need to thank Him for everything, which means there's not a single spot in your life that you don't owe Him allegiance. And we hate that. Because our image of who we are is that we can call the shots. We are our own masters.

We decide what is right or wrong, especially our Western culture tells us that. And so along comes the God of the Bible in particular. And there is no God that's more traumatic than the God of the Bible. Why? Well, see, what if you say, well, I believe in a God of love, just a God that's a spirit of love everywhere.

See, that does not get in the first way. You don't have to thank that person, do you? That's not a person. You're still in control. You can still live with the illusion that you're in charge of your life.

Or if you believe there's other kinds of God, I just believe that God is the force of life and everything. There's all sorts of ways of believing in God that are traumatic and that we embrace, but the God of the Bible or put it like this. Imagine you had this really great scam going. There was a neighborhood in New York City that you go to and you dress up as a police officer. You impersonate a police officer.

And the waters park when you go there and they, you know, people give you free sandwiches and they. Top of the morning to you officer and you know, everything goes really nicely. Now, while you're, while you're impersonating the police officer, you'll probably be a little nervous. You'll be a little afraid that maybe you'll say something that might make, you know, somebody say, what, why would a police officer say this? You're a little nervous, of course, because you're impersonating an officer.

But what if in the distance coming walking towards you, you see a real police officer. You're not just nervous now. You're scared. Why? Because there's no chance that the real police officer is going to expose you as an impersonator.

It will happen. Therefore, all human beings, according to Paul, we want to call the shots. We want to be our own bosses. We want to be in control of our lives. We want to take credit.

So that's cosmic plagiarism. We want to take credit for who we are and what we've done. We want to pat ourselves on the back in all those ways. What are we doing? We're impersonating a god.

We're impersonating a creator. You know, we're self-made people and we're worshiping our creator. But what happens? See, when somebody comes along, says, I believe in a god who kind of made the world and now he's off in the, he's a remote or somebody says, I believe in a nature, a god who is nature, I believe in this, I believe. There's a whole lot of gods that actually don't threaten you.

But when you get to the biblical god who creates you and sustains you who is a glorious god and who you to whom you owe everything, that is a god who's going to freak you out. You're going to melt down. That's like when you're impersonating a police officer and you see a real police officer coming, you're impersonating a god. And when you see the real god coming, the biblical god coming, you go nuts. And Paul says, that's the reason why even though we know there's a god and we actually, in some ways, live as if there's a god.

We were honest with ourselves. We can't not know that there's a god. It presses his reality presses on us all the time. At the same time, we desperately do not want to believe in God. Everybody in this room, including the guy behind the microphone right now, it says, suppresses the truth to some degree.

None of us can bear the full reality of who God is. It's too threatening. It's too traumatic. We all try to whittle God down somehow, flatten him. But the biblical god, very traumatic.

And so though we can know God and we do know God, we don't know God. Well, what do we do about it? What can we do about it? Well, there actually is clues here as to what we can do about it and how we can truly know the god who's really there, how we can heal ourselves of our fears so that we can know him truly. And what is that?

Well, let me put it like this. This in some ways gets into the rest of the book of Romans and we're not looking at the whole book of Romans. But let me show you, let's go back to verse 1920 for a minute and say, if you look at nature, he says, if you look at creation, if you look at the things that have been made, what can you learn about God? He's invisible. He's eternal.

He's powerful. He's divine. Okay. What's missing from the list? Is there anything there that it says you can't know about God just by looking at nature, just by using your reason, just by using all your rational powers, by trying to be objective?

No matter how hard you try, looking at the things that are made, there's one thing you're not going to know anything about. What is it? Does anything about his love or his grace? And probably that's true. Let's look at nature class.

Let's look at a geologically. Oh, look at the volcanoes. Look at the earthquakes. Do you just look at that and just say, I just see that God is a God of love. No.

Let's look at the nature meteorologically. Hurricanes, see, you know, tsunamis. Do you just look at nature and say, you just, I just know God is a God of love. Let's look at it astronomically. You know, we're in a galaxy.

Our galaxy is just, you know, zillions and zillions of miles wide. We, and there are 100 billion galaxies we even know of, and we only probably know of a tiny amount of how many there really are. And do you look at that and the idea that there's a God who made all that, you just look at that and say, oh, I just really want to know a God like that. No, you're scared to death. If there is a God that made all that, what am I?

Let's look at it biologically. You know, Annie Dillard wrote a great book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and went out to live, you know, in the mountains of Virginia years ago. She won a Pulitzer Prize for the book, and she said, I wanted to observe nature. So she watched at the creek. She watched nature.

She thought it would make her close to nature, and she saw how violent nature was. She saw a giant water bug sting and paralyze a frog, and then put its thing down into its brain and suck its brains out until it sort of collapsed like a piece of clothing with nobody in it. And she said, oh, nature. Do you look at nature, read and tooth and claw, and say, oh, I just know God is a God of love. No, you will not find that God is a God of love.

In fact, now this is a little more controversial. I'm going to take 20 seconds on it. I promise I can back it up, but I'll just tell you, do you look at other religions? And say, well, other religions all say God is a God of love. No, you go to Buddhism.

They talk about being compassionate if you're a Buddhist. Of course, but it's because this world is unreal, and you shouldn't grab hold of anything. And the idea is that God is an impersonal soul, and we're going to become impersonal souls. No, they don't believe God is a God of love. In fact, if you talk to Islam, you say, do you believe your God is a God of love?

They'll talk about being merciful, but I know with many, many Muslims I've talked to is God a God of love. They said, no, we wouldn't say that. So where do you get this idea that God is a God of love? It's so pervasive in the world. I'll tell you where you get the idea.

It comes from the Bible. That's the only source in human thought. But if you really don't just pull what you want out of the Bible and really find the biblical God, here's what you see. Verse 18, wrath. A wrathful God, a God who gets angry at sin, a God who gets incredibly angry at sin.

And a little later on in Romans 3, it'll say, in the wages of sin is death. Wrath, demanding death because we disobey him. And then yet, look, verse 16, 17, but I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. See, first the Jew, the good person, then the Gentile, the pagan person, it doesn't matter.

For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed. A righteousness is not earned, not something that you develop, but is given as a gift. It's by faith, from first to last. And you will live by it. Now here's the point.

When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control. You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great.

It's great. Why? Because the other person loses control, too. You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God.

A God of love. Yeah, you know what? You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control. And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are.

That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating. But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control.

Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit. He's nailed. He loses complete control.

Why? He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death. In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control.

So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us. Now, what is that? That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that.

No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to. The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself. There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God.

Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid. And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you. It's just too great.

Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you. It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross. And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says. That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers.

What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes. Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes.

My humiliation? Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot. I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death. That's wrong.

It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die. For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ. The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was.

But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself?

Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love? That was Father Martin's answer.

Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God. In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord. Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are.

We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：分享信仰

我们如何分享真正认识耶稣的意义？不仅仅是作为一个历史人物或道德教师，而是作为救主和君王。本月，Tim Keller 探讨圣经向我们展示的关于公开信仰和分享我们在基督里的希望。今天的阅读来自《罗马书》。第一章第16至21节。

> 因为我不以福音为耻，这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来，这义是本于信，以至于信。如经上所记，义人必因信得生。

**神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。因为神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为神已经给他们显明。**

自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的话。

### 认识上帝：罗马书1章

所以我们又进入了一个系列的第四周，我们正在进行一个叫做公开信仰的系列，分享内心的希望，每周的小组中我们都在讨论我们在周日早晨所谈论的内容，而我们并不生活在一个鼓励人们公开他们的宗教信仰和宗教信念的社会中，这真的很讽刺，因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开其他一切。

**我们必须告诉人们我们是谁，但想想看。没有什么比你的宗教信仰更根本地定义你的身份和你是谁。**

### 上帝的存在

现在，这周我们想谈谈如何谈论上帝和上帝的存在？你不能公开谈论信仰，你不能谈论上帝的存在，但你可以这样做而不陷入争吵，它是这样的。上帝存在。没有，上帝不存在。那就是互联网，你知道吗？

有时实际上在这条街上，我认为让人们更反思的一种方法是不要问上帝是否存在的问题，而是你怎么知道？你怎么知道上帝是否存在？你怎么知道上帝？或者如果你说你不能知道是否有上帝，你怎么知道的？

**看，当你开始问这个问题时，你怎么知道是否有上帝，或者你怎么知道你能否知道是否有上帝？这只是让事情慢下来，让人们多反思一点。**

没有比罗马书第一章更好、更巧妙和聪明的答案了，这个问题的答案是，如何知道是否有上帝，而这部分罗马书第一章是圣保罗写的。

### 人类对真理的压制

保罗实际上给了你四个答案，几乎同时给出，所以我们要看它们。就在这几节经文中，他说，我们可以认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝。我们可以真正认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝，同时，顺便说一下，有一种方法可以真正认识上帝。他在这里都说了。让我们看看。

首先，正如我所说，他确实在这里说你可以知道有上帝。例如，著名的经文，都是著名的，第19和20节。关于上帝所能知道的事情是显而易见的，因为自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得。

现在，他在这里说什么？他说，在所造之物中，那就是自然，受造的世界。那里有线索，明显的线索，关于上帝的存在。他实际上是在说，从你在自然中看到的东西中推断出上帝的存在是可能的。

### 福音的医治力量

现在，我使用“线索”这个词的原因是，许多人有时会误称这些线索为证明。所以有些人说，通过观察自然和观察世界，你可以证明有上帝。如果你上网，或者去任何哲学教科书，他们会给你那些证明。那些来自观察自然和受造秩序的证明，它们有这些伟大的长名字。

一旦你知道怎么说它们，你就会感觉好多了。它真的有助于你的自尊。所以有宇宙论论证，还有目的论论证。现在，保罗没有在这里使用“证明”这个词。我认为这是过度解读。证明是没有理性的人可以否认的东西。没有理性的人可以找到任何不相信的理由。

**我不认为保罗是在说这个。我认为他实际上是在说，如果我们的认知能力，我们的心灵和思想的认知能力处于更好的状态，我们会更容易承认这些线索。但它们在那里。**

它们是什么？好吧，我宁愿，他没有告诉你太多。他只是说上帝的现实是神性和他的力量有线索。我只想进入这两个一分钟，只是为了展示它是如何工作的。但它们不是证明，而是线索。

### 结论

当你把自己交给某人去爱，当你进入一段爱的关系，并把自己交给某人去爱时，你会失去控制吗？是的，你会失去控制。你不能随心所欲地生活。当你进入一段爱的关系时，你会失去控制。这是伟大的。这是伟大的。

为什么？因为另一个人也失去了控制。如果这是一段真正的爱的关系，你们不会互相利用。如果你只是简单地仰望天空说，我想相信一个爱的上帝，听着，那只是扁平化了上帝。一个爱的上帝。是的，你知道吗？

你害怕失去控制。你和我都害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说，我只是相信一个不审判任何人并接受每个人的爱的上帝。那是一个不会威胁你的扁平化的上帝。他们不会揭露你在冒充。

但福音的上帝，福音的上帝是这样的。他是一个愤怒的上帝，因为他对罪愤怒，但耶稣基督，上帝的儿子，来到这个世界，走上十字架，失去控制。完全失去控制。每个人都对他为所欲为。他被打。他被刺。他被钉。他完全失去控制。为什么？他承担我们应得的。他承担那愤怒。他承担那死亡。

**换句话说，上帝的儿子，道成肉身的上帝如此爱我们，他愿意失去控制。这样他就可以承担我们的惩罚，以便他可以原谅我们并爱我们。**

那是什么？那是一种不利用的爱。你看，你可以把自己交给这个上帝，因为他为你走上了十字架。你看，没有其他宗教有这样的东西。没有其他哲学有这样的东西。现在，终于，我有一个可以把自己交给的上帝。

福音和福音的上帝是一个爱的上帝和一个圣洁的上帝，一个如此圣洁的上帝，他必须惩罚罪，一个如此爱的上帝，他愿意自己承担惩罚。现在你有一个荣耀的上帝。你有一个多维的上帝，一个复杂的上帝，一个真实的个人上帝。一个我可以认识的上帝，也是一个我可以把自己交给而不害怕的上帝。

所以，阻止我真正认识上帝的恐惧被福音治愈了。这是独特的。我最喜欢的部分，实际上是我在《少年派的奇幻漂流》中唯一喜欢的部分，是这个地方，我必须读给你听。它太棒了。每隔几年，我就得拿出来读给你听。

这是一个男孩探索所有不同的宗教，他倾向于印度教，但后来他和一个天主教神父交谈，神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和他在十字架上的死亡。男孩惊慌失措，这是他说的。

> 一个上帝会忍受逆境，我可以理解。印度教的神面对他们的公平份额的小偷、恶霸、绑架者和篡位者。《罗摩衍那》是什么，只是罗摩的一天糟糕的一天吗？逆境？是的。命运的逆转？是的，背叛，是的。我的屈辱？死亡？我无法想象克里希纳勋爵同意被剥光、鞭打、嘲笑、拖过街道，更不用说被钉十字架了，而且是在仅仅是人类的手中。

我从未听说过一个印度教的神会死，但神性不应该被死亡玷污。这是错误的。这个基督教的上帝让他的化身死去是错误的。这相当于让他的一部分死去。因为如果太阳要死，那不能是假的。如果十字架上的上帝是上帝羞辱人类悲剧，那就把基督的受难变成基督的闹剧。

太阳的死亡必须是真实的，马丁神父向我保证它是。但一旦一个死去的上帝，总是一个死去的上帝，即使复活，这个太阳必须永远在他的嘴里有死亡的味道。三位一体必须被它污染。上帝父的右手一定有某种臭味。恐怖必须是真实的。为什么上帝要把这种事加在自己身上？为什么不把死亡留给凡人？为什么要弄脏美丽的东西？为什么要破坏完美的东西？爱？那是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们看到我们永远不会通过扫描天空和使用我们的理性和理性论证学到的东西是上帝的牺牲之爱。在耶稣基督里，主，我们永远不会知道，除非在福音中，但那是我们需要治愈我们心灵的东西。所以我们对上帝的原始和深刻的内在知识，终于可以被释放。我们害怕你，主。

我们害怕失去控制。你的现实，你的荣耀现实对我们来说太过创伤，但只有在福音中我们才能被治愈，才能拥抱你，最终与我们的创造者、我们的制造者、我们的救赎者、我们被建造来崇拜、爱和认识的那一位重新团聚。哦，主。

教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，那些理解福音并经历过那种医治的人。教导我们在心中使用福音，以便我们可以不断获得更好和更荣耀的对你现实的看法，因为即使现在，主，我们中的许多人，我们是信徒，但我们仍然没有完全掌握你的伟大。

我们有时仍然扭曲这一点，父亲教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，以便其他人可以通过看到你儿子耶稣基督的福音和他的爱的福音而知道心灵的医治。奉他的名祷告。阿门。
