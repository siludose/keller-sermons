## English Transcript / 英文原文

today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel  because it is a power of God  that brings salvation to everyone who believes,  first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed,  a righteousness that is by faith,  from first to last, just as it is written,  the righteous will live by faith. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven  against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people  who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them,  because God has made it plain to them.

For since the creation of the world,  God's invisible qualities, his eternal power  and divine nature have been clearly seen,  being understood from what has been made,  so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God,  they neither glorified him as God,  nor gave thanks to him,  but their thinking became futile  and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord. So we are again in a fourth week of a series  we're doing called public faith,  sharing the hope that's within,  and each week in the small groups  we're talking about what we are talking about here  on a Sunday morning,  and we don't live in a society that encourages people  to be public about their religious faith  and their religious beliefs,  which is really ironic,  because we are encouraged in our society  to be public about everything else. We have to tell people who we are,  but think about it.

There's nothing more fundamental to your identity  and who you are than your religious beliefs. And therefore, if we're going to have a truly open  and pluralistic society,  we all have to learn how to be public  about who we are,  about our deepest faith beliefs,  and yet to do so in a way that's respectful to others  and promotes peace. And that's what we're exploring in these morning messages  in the small groups each week. Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God  and about God's existence? You're not going to be able to talk public about faith,  you can't talk about God in this existence,  but you go about that without getting into a shouting match  and it goes like this.

God does exist. No, God doesn't exist. That's the internet right there, you know? And sometimes actually out on this street,  I think one of the ways to make people more reflective  is to not ask the question, does God exist,  but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists?

How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not,  how do you know that? See, as soon as you start to ask the question,  how do you know whether there's a God,  or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God? It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more. And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question.

How can you know whether there's a God or not,  than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1,  written by St. Paul. I don't think there's any more brilliant and ingenious answer to the question. How can we know whether there's a God or not than here? Because Paul actually gives you four answers,  pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all.

Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God. We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God.

We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way,  and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here. Let's take a look. First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God.

So for example, the famous verses,  they're all famous, 19 and 20. What may be known about God is plain,  for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made. Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world. There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence.

He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence  from what you see in nature. Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people  have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs. And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world,  you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook,  they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature  and the created order are proofs,  they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them,  then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument,  and there's the teleological argument. Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in.

A proof is something that no rational person can deny. No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it. And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties,  of our hearts and minds were in better condition,  we would acknowledge those clues more readily. But they're there.

What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much. He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power  are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute,  just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

The cosmological argument works like this. How could something come from nothing? That's it. So for example, you know, the big bang theory,  the universe started with a bang. How could nothing have exploded?

You know, nothing can't explode. So how could the explosion come from nothing? Well, somebody says, well, it wasn't that there was nothing. There was something. Okay, but where'd that something come from?

And as soon as you keep asking that question,  where did that something come from? It came from that, where did that something come from? And if you go all the way back to say, well,  there was something that had no cause,  that it didn't come from nothing,  it was always there since we know nothing in this world like that. Everything we know has a beginning. Everything we know is an effect with a cause.

As soon as you start talking about an uncaused cause,  as soon as you start talking about something that has no,  there was always there,  you're talking about something supernatural. Say, something that we don't know here in nature,  something beyond nature, something divine. And see, that's how the cosmological argument goes. And says, how could all this come from nothing? And if it didn't come from nothing, then what brought it about?

The teleological argument is actually kind of fun, too. And again, I'm looking at my watch. They're just fun. If they're not enough to make people believe in God,  they haven't. But they are there, the clues are there.

The teleological argument comes from the word telos,  which means design. And it talks about the fact that the world is so perfectly designed,  how could it have come about by accident? Now the physicist will tell you this,  and I have to look at my notes just to say it right,  that the fundamental regularities and constants of physics,  things like speed of light, gravitational constant,  the strength of weak and strong nuclear forces,  all of these things have to be perfectly calibrated. It's almost like there are a hundred dials,  and every single dial has to be exactly at the right spot,  not a single one can be off a hair. They all have to be so perfectly calibrated in such a way  for matter to coalesce, unless all those things were exactly  the way they are, we wouldn't have matter,  we wouldn't have a world, we wouldn't have human life.

And so what many people have said is,  so many things had to happen exactly the way they are,  whether it even be human life, even to be life,  even to be matter, that couldn't happen by accident. So God did it. That's the teleological argument. Now people like Richard Dawkins or Stephen Hawking,  who are atheists, spend a lot of time refuting that argument,  and you know what that means? It means it must have force or they wouldn't spend the time.

But you know what they all say? What Dawkins says, you know what Stephen Hawking says? What they say is that at the big bang,  there could have been an infinite number of possible universes formed,  and we just happen to be in the universe where matter coalesces,  where all the various fundamental regularities and constants of physics  are exactly the way they ought to be for life to happen. So there we are. There's an resilience and resilience of those universes  and we just happen to be in the one where it happens.

And of course there's a lot of philosophers have a lot of fun with that. I'm going to just give you one. John Leslie is a philosopher that tells you this story. John Leslie tells you this story. He says, imagine there's a man about to be executed.

And so this sergeant gets 50 crack marksmen  and lines them up six feet from the prisoner. And so 50 crack marksmen with their rifles,  six feet from the prisoner, ready, aim, fire. And they all miss. The sergeant says, what happened? Every single man says, gosh, serge, I just had a twitch my nose,  you know, something in my eye, you know, I'm sorry, all 50 at once.

And the sergeant says it can't hold me with 50 at once. And then one guy who took a philosophy course says,  but sergeant at the big bang,  there could have been a zillions of possible universes formed. And we just happened to be in the universe  where all 50 crack marksmen happened to, you know,  have a twitch in their nose at the very same moment. Now, you know, first of all, the sergeant,  if he also took a philosophy course,  he would have to say, you're right, I can't prove that this was a conspiracy. Because we just happened to maybe be in the one universe, right?

I can't prove it, but I know it was a conspiracy. I would never, in a million years,  it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that we just happened to be in the one universe  where all that can happen. I want you to assume it's a conspiracy. That it was as somebody did it. That it was contrived, that there was some personal action,  there was some personal design involved, right?

He wouldn't assume the one in a zillion chance happened. He would assume it was a personal design. And for you to say, there's a one in a zillion chance that maybe there is no God. Does that make sense to base your entire life on that? So these are the cosmological and teleological arguments.

And these are basically forms of the kinds of clues that people have seen over the years. And Paul says they're there. They're really our clues. But Paul says something much more radical than that. A lot more radical.

Because he doesn't just say it's possible to know God by looking at nature. He actually goes a little beyond that, way beyond that,  and says every human being actually does know God. See where he says that? He says God is mad. And why is he mad?

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people. This is everybody, humanity, who suppress the truth. What truth? What is known, may be known about God. And then down in verse 21, he says, for although they knew God,  they wouldn't glorify Him as God.

What he is saying is people, all people are suppressing the truth about God's existence. Now you can't suppress something unless you've got it. And what he's saying is at some very deep level, every human being knows that God is there. Now this, by the way, is a very offensive statement to people. In fact, just in the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times yesterday,  there was a letter to the editor.

The letter to the editor had to do with some op-ed piece that I happen to miss. But some op-ed person had said this term in one of the op-ed pieces earlier this week  that there are no atheists and foxholes. You've heard that. That when the shooting begins and even the atheist show that they actually believe in God,  well, one atheist wrote in and he was very offended and is what he said. And this is fair.

He says, quote, he says, the implication that atheists are all really theists at heart  and that our convictions are casually and shadowly held  and easily abandoned in the face of adversity is simply untrue. He says to say, he's an atheist. He says to say that I'm really a theist at heart and my atheism, my beliefs, our convictions,  are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned. He just isn't true. Well, see Paul is not saying anything like that.

Here's what Paul is saying. Yes, Paul is saying that it's some level everybody knows there's a God. But as we're going to see in a minute, he's also saying at a profound level,  everybody, we all believe in God yet we don't believe in God. And what's interesting, the translators can never get this right  because it's a very awkward construction. But Paul deliberately, when he says, what may be known about God, is plain to them.

For since the creation of the world's invisible qualities,  eternal power, have been clearly seen, being understood,  the verbs there are present passive participles in Greek. And what it means is, and this is what the commentators say,  what it means is that the reality of God bears down on us constantly. That is that there's part of our heart that doesn't believe God's there  and yet there's another part of our heart that's sensitive to his reality  and that reality bears down on us. So what Paul is describing is a deeply conflicted dialogue between the part of our hearts  that denies the existence of God and the part of our hearts that's sensitive to his reality. There's nothing casual or shallow about that.

And yet Paul is saying that at some level, in some part of our heart, we know God's there. Now you say, what's the evidence for that? See, we're not talking here, you can look at the arguments for God and infer his existence. We're saying, Paul is saying that all people already know about his existence. At some level, they know he's there.

Well, what's the evidence for that? I have, after many, many years of finding it interesting to read the biographies  of atheists who have become Christians. I see what Paul is talking about. There's a whole slew of prominent, some more famous than others,  British intellectuals who are atheists and who became Christians. I mean, some of them are more famous like T.S.

Eliot, W.H. Auden, I see a slew. Some are a little less famous like C.E.M. Joan, A.N. Wilson.

People like they all have initials, lots of initials there. But a lot of these were British intellectuals, brilliant men,  and they were biographers in literary critics and thinkers and that sort of thing in poets. And even though they had rejected Christianity growing up and they became part of the intellectual elites,  all of whom laughed at religion and Christianity, they shocked their contemporaries and their peers  by embracing Christianity in one form or another. When I look at them and I study them, I see that very seldom, if ever,  do they look at the evidence like the cosmologic argument and the teleological argument  and they come to conclude, I guess there's a God. Rather, when they talk about how they found faith, they come to say,  they come to see that they believed God all along, they were living as if there was a God.

They weren't admitting that they were living as if there was a God  and they finally admitted he's got to be there. Very interesting. Let me just give you two. One is not as interesting and not as well known as the other. A.N.

Wilson, he's more recent. A.N. Wilson was a... Kathy, I know him because he really turned on Christianity  and he wrote a terrible biography of C.S. Lewis, basically attacking him for his beliefs.

He wrote biographies of Jesus of Paul, he was very skeptical of Christianity, rejected it,  very brilliant man, but on Easter 2009 he put an article in the paper said,  I have embraced Christianity, just shocked everybody and gave an Easter testimony. And in it, this is what he said, he says most public voices he's talking about in Britain. Most public voices have accepted the idea that only stupid people actually believe in Christianity. As a matter of fact, it's materialist atheism that is not merely an arid creed but is totally irrational. For materialist atheism says, we are just a collection of chemicals.

It has no answer whatsoever to the question of how we should be capable of love or heroism  or poetry if we are simply animated pieces of meat. And he goes on and tries to say, he says, people who believe there is no God  and that we are just... what he called us, we're just bags of chemicals  and animated pieces of meat that have evolved. Then we say we need to be noble and we need to believe in justice  and we need to love each other and he says there's no basis for that. Now you say where does that come from? Let me give you a second case study because it's a little clearer and more fascinating.

W.H. Auden, a poet, was considered one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. What's interesting to me is that his conversion happened right here in the Upper East Side years ago. He was British but he was living in America during World War II and he had embraced atheism  just like everybody in his intellectual class. But it started evidently when he was... you know that just the northern part of the Upper East Side,  sort of the north eastern part of the Upper East Side, Yorkville was back in World War II  and in the 30s and 40s a very, very German place.

Lots and lots of German people lived here. And there were a lot of... in fact, when we got here to start the church,  there were still lots and lots of German-speaking churches and restaurants and places like that  still in the late 80s up in the Upper East Side largely vanished. But during the 40s W.H. Auden went to... he was working on his German actually  and there were a number of German cinemas, places that show German films. And he went into a film house somewhere in the late 30s and saw a film that obviously had been influenced by Nazism  and he saw... he saw American Jew...

German people, American... German American people,  these Germans living in America, yelling at the screen slurs against the Jews that appeared in this story. And it shook him. And eventually this is what he wrote. He came back to Christianity, shocked everybody and this is what he wrote.

Let me set this up for you because it's very important. Auden thought that all educated and lightened people would believe in freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. Basically believe that all educated people, all cultured people, you know, all reasonable people,  people who believed in the importance of human reason and who are cultured,  that they would believe in the values of freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. What happened was that Germany had embraced Nazism and Germany was second to none as a sophisticated, educated society,  tremendous science, tremendous music, tremendous art, scholarship. You know Germany was second to none and yet they had embraced the idea that you should... well, that loving your neighbor and justice and human rights was a fiction.

So this is what Odin wrote. It created a crisis for him and here's what he wrote. If I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated in Hitler have no heaven to cry to. The whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine faith in the absolute.

It is tried to make reason the judge. But either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitler monster will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. And here's what he means. He says he believed in human rights liberty and freedom. Why?

Why should you believe in human rights and freedom? Why? Especially, let's use your reason, huh? And let's look at nature. But what you see, when you look at nature, reason looks at nature.

It's science and empirical. What do you see? You see the strong eating the weak. That's nature. That's how you got here.

The strong eating the weak. So now on what basis do you see a strong country eating a weak country or a strong race eating a weaker race, you know, destroying a pressing mark, on what basis do you say that's wrong? What reason? See, you're just using your reason, not morality, not heaven, not moral absence, just your reason. How do you decide that human freedom and dignity and human rights and justice for all?

Why believe that when that's not how nature works? He says Hitler was using reason. And reason is, hey, we're products of evolution. And so here's basically what he says. Yeah.

Of course, without God, you can have moral feelings. Oh, listen carefully, everybody. Without God, you can have moral feelings. Sure. You can feel it's wrong to oppress people.

You can feel human rights are right, okay? But without God, there can be no moral obligation. That is you have no right to say that your moral feelings should determine them, their behavior. See, you have moral feelings, your English, they have moral feelings, they're Nazis and they're Germans. How dare you say that your moral feelings are right and there's a wrong?

When there's no standard. And therefore, here's what he decided, if you believe that human rights and justice are not imaginary values, but are real. And if there is no God, they would be imaginary, but they're not imaginary. Therefore, there must be a God. Without God, there can be moral feelings, but there can't be moral obligation.

You can't say you are obliged to follow my moral feelings. But if you believe, well, they genocide is wrong. Oppression is wrong. Human rights are right. They're not just my feelings.

They're right. There must be a God. And Auden realized he was believing God all along. He just wasn't being honest with himself. We know there's a God.

Deep down. We suppress it. But that's the third point. See, the other thing that is so brilliant about Paul's analysis is, is the human condition. We can know God.

And we do know there's a God. And yet, we don't know there's a God. See, when he says, in the very moment he says, we do know God. He also says, we suppress it. We repress it.

So we don't know it. And yet we do know it. And yet we don't know it. And both are fundamentally the same. I mean, they're equally strong.

Now, what kind of stuff do we modern people know? We tend to suppress or repress. Why do you suppress something? Why do you repress something? If it's traumatic.

Now, sometimes memories can be traumatic. One of my favorite Agatha Christie novels is Sleeping Murder. And it's about a young woman who buys a house. And in the house she starts to have flashbacks of a murder she saw. And it turns out that as a little girl, she was in the house and she'd repress the memories of a murder.

And that's how the murder works. Now, the fact is that psychologists will tell you that there's really probably not that many truly repressed memories that are traumatic. I mean, there's a lot of fiction about it and there are a lot of people talk about it in the media. But the reality is it's probably not true that some memories are so traumatic. We simply repress them.

It's pretty rare. But I'll tell you what you do repress. If you're really angry, you can repress that. No, I'm not that angry. If you're really feeling guilty about something you've done, you can repress that.

No, I don't really feel guilty. Anything about your heart that doesn't fit in with your identity, your way that you'd like to think about who you are. So you have a chosen identity. I like to think of myself as this or as this or this. And when data comes in, things that you've done or feelings you've got that doesn't fit that data, you screen it out, you suppress it, you repress it.

And Paul says that's exactly what we're doing with God. Why? Because the knowledge of God is incredibly traumatic. So it tells you right here, verse 21, key verse. For although they knew God, they didn't glorify God.

And what's glorify me? They didn't treat God as as big and as glorious as He truly is, as multi-dimensional, as great, as magnificent as He is. Why? Because they didn't want to thank Him. Now you might say, what?

That's the big sin. That's the whole problem. We don't want to thank God. Yeah. By the way, even at the legal level, there's this thing called plagiarism.

What's plagiarism? For refusing to thank somebody, for the intellectual property you're ripping off, refusing to thank somebody saying, and I want to acknowledge that I got all these ideas from so we don't say that. Why? Because then we are showing our dependence and showing our obligation and showing we may actually not have complete control over what we're saying. But you see, if there's a God, then we are utterly dependent on Him.

And we are totally obliged to Him. See, if there's a God who made us and keeps us alive every second, then that's traumatic because it means we need to thank Him for everything, which means there's not a single spot in your life that you don't owe Him allegiance. And we hate that. Because our image of who we are is that we can call the shots. We are our own masters.

We decide what is right or wrong, especially our Western culture tells us that. And so along comes the God of the Bible in particular. And there is no God that's more traumatic than the God of the Bible. Why? Well, see, what if you say, well, I believe in a God of love, just a God that's a spirit of love everywhere.

See, that does not get in the first way. You don't have to thank that person, do you? That's not a person. You're still in control. You can still live with the illusion that you're in charge of your life.

Or if you believe there's other kinds of God, I just believe that God is the force of life and everything. There's all sorts of ways of believing in God that are traumatic and that we embrace, but the God of the Bible or put it like this. Imagine you had this really great scam going. There was a neighborhood in New York City that you go to and you dress up as a police officer. You impersonate a police officer.

And the waters park when you go there and they, you know, people give you free sandwiches and they. Top of the morning to you officer and you know, everything goes really nicely. Now, while you're, while you're impersonating the police officer, you'll probably be a little nervous. You'll be a little afraid that maybe you'll say something that might make, you know, somebody say, what, why would a police officer say this? You're a little nervous, of course, because you're impersonating an officer.

But what if in the distance coming walking towards you, you see a real police officer. You're not just nervous now. You're scared. Why? Because there's no chance that the real police officer is going to expose you as an impersonator.

It will happen. Therefore, all human beings, according to Paul, we want to call the shots. We want to be our own bosses. We want to be in control of our lives. We want to take credit.

So that's cosmic plagiarism. We want to take credit for who we are and what we've done. We want to pat ourselves on the back in all those ways. What are we doing? We're impersonating a god.

We're impersonating a creator. You know, we're self-made people and we're worshiping our creator. But what happens? See, when somebody comes along, says, I believe in a god who kind of made the world and now he's off in the, he's a remote or somebody says, I believe in a nature, a god who is nature, I believe in this, I believe. There's a whole lot of gods that actually don't threaten you.

But when you get to the biblical god who creates you and sustains you who is a glorious god and who you to whom you owe everything, that is a god who's going to freak you out. You're going to melt down. That's like when you're impersonating a police officer and you see a real police officer coming, you're impersonating a god. And when you see the real god coming, the biblical god coming, you go nuts. And Paul says, that's the reason why even though we know there's a god and we actually, in some ways, live as if there's a god.

We were honest with ourselves. We can't not know that there's a god. It presses his reality presses on us all the time. At the same time, we desperately do not want to believe in God. Everybody in this room, including the guy behind the microphone right now, it says, suppresses the truth to some degree.

None of us can bear the full reality of who God is. It's too threatening. It's too traumatic. We all try to whittle God down somehow, flatten him. But the biblical god, very traumatic.

And so though we can know God and we do know God, we don't know God. Well, what do we do about it? What can we do about it? Well, there actually is clues here as to what we can do about it and how we can truly know the god who's really there, how we can heal ourselves of our fears so that we can know him truly. And what is that?

Well, let me put it like this. This in some ways gets into the rest of the book of Romans and we're not looking at the whole book of Romans. But let me show you, let's go back to verse 1920 for a minute and say, if you look at nature, he says, if you look at creation, if you look at the things that have been made, what can you learn about God? He's invisible. He's eternal.

He's powerful. He's divine. Okay. What's missing from the list? Is there anything there that it says you can't know about God just by looking at nature, just by using your reason, just by using all your rational powers, by trying to be objective?

No matter how hard you try, looking at the things that are made, there's one thing you're not going to know anything about. What is it? Does anything about his love or his grace? And probably that's true. Let's look at nature class.

Let's look at a geologically. Oh, look at the volcanoes. Look at the earthquakes. Do you just look at that and just say, I just see that God is a God of love. No.

Let's look at the nature meteorologically. Hurricanes, see, you know, tsunamis. Do you just look at nature and say, you just, I just know God is a God of love. Let's look at it astronomically. You know, we're in a galaxy.

Our galaxy is just, you know, zillions and zillions of miles wide. We, and there are 100 billion galaxies we even know of, and we only probably know of a tiny amount of how many there really are. And do you look at that and the idea that there's a God who made all that, you just look at that and say, oh, I just really want to know a God like that. No, you're scared to death. If there is a God that made all that, what am I?

Let's look at it biologically. You know, Annie Dillard wrote a great book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and went out to live, you know, in the mountains of Virginia years ago. She won a Pulitzer Prize for the book, and she said, I wanted to observe nature. So she watched at the creek. She watched nature.

She thought it would make her close to nature, and she saw how violent nature was. She saw a giant water bug sting and paralyze a frog, and then put its thing down into its brain and suck its brains out until it sort of collapsed like a piece of clothing with nobody in it. And she said, oh, nature. Do you look at nature, read and tooth and claw, and say, oh, I just know God is a God of love. No, you will not find that God is a God of love.

In fact, now this is a little more controversial. I'm going to take 20 seconds on it. I promise I can back it up, but I'll just tell you, do you look at other religions? And say, well, other religions all say God is a God of love. No, you go to Buddhism.

They talk about being compassionate if you're a Buddhist. Of course, but it's because this world is unreal, and you shouldn't grab hold of anything. And the idea is that God is an impersonal soul, and we're going to become impersonal souls. No, they don't believe God is a God of love. In fact, if you talk to Islam, you say, do you believe your God is a God of love?

They'll talk about being merciful, but I know with many, many Muslims I've talked to is God a God of love. They said, no, we wouldn't say that. So where do you get this idea that God is a God of love? It's so pervasive in the world. I'll tell you where you get the idea.

It comes from the Bible. That's the only source in human thought. But if you really don't just pull what you want out of the Bible and really find the biblical God, here's what you see. Verse 18, wrath. A wrathful God, a God who gets angry at sin, a God who gets incredibly angry at sin.

And a little later on in Romans 3, it'll say, in the wages of sin is death. Wrath, demanding death because we disobey him. And then yet, look, verse 16, 17, but I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. See, first the Jew, the good person, then the Gentile, the pagan person, it doesn't matter.

For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed. A righteousness is not earned, not something that you develop, but is given as a gift. It's by faith, from first to last. And you will live by it. Now here's the point.

When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control. You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great.

It's great. Why? Because the other person loses control, too. You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God.

A God of love. Yeah, you know what? You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control. And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are.

That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating. But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control.

Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit. He's nailed. He loses complete control.

Why? He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death. In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control.

So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us. Now, what is that? That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that.

No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to. The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself. There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God.

Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid. And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you. It's just too great.

Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you. It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross. And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says. That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers.

What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes. Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes.

My humiliation? Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot. I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death. That's wrong.

It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die. For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ. The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was.

But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself?

Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love? That was Father Martin's answer.

Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God. In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord. Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are.

We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### English Transcript (for reference)

today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21. For I am not ashamed of the Gospel  because it is a power of God  that brings salvation to everyone who believes,  first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed,  a righteousness that is by faith,  from first to last, just as it is written,  the righteous will live by faith. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven  against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people  who suppress the truth by their wickedness,  since what may be known about God is plain to them,  because God has made it plain to them.

For since the creation of the world,  God's invisible qualities, his eternal power  and divine nature have been clearly seen,  being understood from what has been made,  so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God,  they neither glorified him as God,  nor gave thanks to him,  but their thinking became futile  and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord. So we are again in a fourth week of a series  we're doing called public faith,  sharing the hope that's within,  and each week in the small groups  we're talking about what we are talking about here  on a Sunday morning,  and we don't live in a society that encourages people  to be public about their religious faith  and their religious beliefs,  which is really ironic,  because we are encouraged in our society  to be public about everything else. We have to tell people who we are,  but think about it.

There's nothing more fundamental to your identity  and who you are than your religious beliefs. And therefore, if we're going to have a truly open  and pluralistic society,  we all have to learn how to be public  about who we are,  about our deepest faith beliefs,  and yet to do so in a way that's respectful to others  and promotes peace. And that's what we're exploring in these morning messages  in the small groups each week. Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God  and about God's existence? You're not going to be able to talk public about faith,  you can't talk about God in this existence,  but you go about that without getting into a shouting match  and it goes like this.

God does exist. No, God doesn't exist. That's the internet right there, you know? And sometimes actually out on this street,  I think one of the ways to make people more reflective  is to not ask the question, does God exist,  but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists?

How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not,  how do you know that? See, as soon as you start to ask the question,  how do you know whether there's a God,  or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God? It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more. And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question.

How can you know whether there's a God or not,  than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1,  written by St. Paul. I don't think there's any more brilliant and ingenious answer to the question. How can we know whether there's a God or not than here? Because Paul actually gives you four answers,  pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all.

Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God. We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God.

We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way,  and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here. Let's take a look. First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God.

So for example, the famous verses,  they're all famous, 19 and 20. What may be known about God is plain,  for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made. Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world. There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence.

He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence  from what you see in nature. Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people  have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs. And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world,  you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook,  they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature  and the created order are proofs,  they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them,  then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument,  and there's the teleological argument. Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in.

A proof is something that no rational person can deny. No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it. And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties,  of our hearts and minds were in better condition,  we would acknowledge those clues more readily. But they're there.

What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much. He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power  are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute,  just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

The cosmological argument works like this. How could something come from nothing? That's it. So for example, you know, the big bang theory,  the universe started with a bang. How could nothing have exploded?

You know, nothing can't explode. So how could the explosion come from nothing? Well, somebody says, well, it wasn't that there was nothing. There was something. Okay, but where'd that something come from?

And as soon as you keep asking that question,  where did that something come from? It came from that, where did that something come from? And if you go all the way back to say, well,  there was something that had no cause,  that it didn't come from nothing,  it was always there since we know nothing in this world like that. Everything we know has a beginning. Everything we know is an effect with a cause.

As soon as you start talking about an uncaused cause,  as soon as you start talking about something that has no,  there was always there,  you're talking about something supernatural. Say, something that we don't know here in nature,  something beyond nature, something divine. And see, that's how the cosmological argument goes. And says, how could all this come from nothing? And if it didn't come from nothing, then what brought it about?

The teleological argument is actually kind of fun, too. And again, I'm looking at my watch. They're just fun. If they're not enough to make people believe in God,  they haven't. But they are there, the clues are there.

The teleological argument comes from the word telos,  which means design. And it talks about the fact that the world is so perfectly designed,  how could it have come about by accident? Now the physicist will tell you this,  and I have to look at my notes just to say it right,  that the fundamental regularities and constants of physics,  things like speed of light, gravitational constant,  the strength of weak and strong nuclear forces,  all of these things have to be perfectly calibrated. It's almost like there are a hundred dials,  and every single dial has to be exactly at the right spot,  not a single one can be off a hair. They all have to be so perfectly calibrated in such a way  for matter to coalesce, unless all those things were exactly  the way they are, we wouldn't have matter,  we wouldn't have a world, we wouldn't have human life.

And so what many people have said is,  so many things had to happen exactly the way they are,  whether it even be human life, even to be life,  even to be matter, that couldn't happen by accident. So God did it. That's the teleological argument. Now people like Richard Dawkins or Stephen Hawking,  who are atheists, spend a lot of time refuting that argument,  and you know what that means? It means it must have force or they wouldn't spend the time.

But you know what they all say? What Dawkins says, you know what Stephen Hawking says? What they say is that at the big bang,  there could have been an infinite number of possible universes formed,  and we just happen to be in the universe where matter coalesces,  where all the various fundamental regularities and constants of physics  are exactly the way they ought to be for life to happen. So there we are. There's an resilience and resilience of those universes  and we just happen to be in the one where it happens.

And of course there's a lot of philosophers have a lot of fun with that. I'm going to just give you one. John Leslie is a philosopher that tells you this story. John Leslie tells you this story. He says, imagine there's a man about to be executed.

And so this sergeant gets 50 crack marksmen  and lines them up six feet from the prisoner. And so 50 crack marksmen with their rifles,  six feet from the prisoner, ready, aim, fire. And they all miss. The sergeant says, what happened? Every single man says, gosh, serge, I just had a twitch my nose,  you know, something in my eye, you know, I'm sorry, all 50 at once.

And the sergeant says it can't hold me with 50 at once. And then one guy who took a philosophy course says,  but sergeant at the big bang,  there could have been a zillions of possible universes formed. And we just happened to be in the universe  where all 50 crack marksmen happened to, you know,  have a twitch in their nose at the very same moment. Now, you know, first of all, the sergeant,  if he also took a philosophy course,  he would have to say, you're right, I can't prove that this was a conspiracy. Because we just happened to maybe be in the one universe, right?

I can't prove it, but I know it was a conspiracy. I would never, in a million years,  it wouldn't be reasonable to assume that we just happened to be in the one universe  where all that can happen. I want you to assume it's a conspiracy. That it was as somebody did it. That it was contrived, that there was some personal action,  there was some personal design involved, right?

He wouldn't assume the one in a zillion chance happened. He would assume it was a personal design. And for you to say, there's a one in a zillion chance that maybe there is no God. Does that make sense to base your entire life on that? So these are the cosmological and teleological arguments.

And these are basically forms of the kinds of clues that people have seen over the years. And Paul says they're there. They're really our clues. But Paul says something much more radical than that. A lot more radical.

Because he doesn't just say it's possible to know God by looking at nature. He actually goes a little beyond that, way beyond that,  and says every human being actually does know God. See where he says that? He says God is mad. And why is he mad?

The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people. This is everybody, humanity, who suppress the truth. What truth? What is known, may be known about God. And then down in verse 21, he says, for although they knew God,  they wouldn't glorify Him as God.

What he is saying is people, all people are suppressing the truth about God's existence. Now you can't suppress something unless you've got it. And what he's saying is at some very deep level, every human being knows that God is there. Now this, by the way, is a very offensive statement to people. In fact, just in the newspaper yesterday, in the New York Times yesterday,  there was a letter to the editor.

The letter to the editor had to do with some op-ed piece that I happen to miss. But some op-ed person had said this term in one of the op-ed pieces earlier this week  that there are no atheists and foxholes. You've heard that. That when the shooting begins and even the atheist show that they actually believe in God,  well, one atheist wrote in and he was very offended and is what he said. And this is fair.

He says, quote, he says, the implication that atheists are all really theists at heart  and that our convictions are casually and shadowly held  and easily abandoned in the face of adversity is simply untrue. He says to say, he's an atheist. He says to say that I'm really a theist at heart and my atheism, my beliefs, our convictions,  are casually and shadowly held and easily abandoned. He just isn't true. Well, see Paul is not saying anything like that.

Here's what Paul is saying. Yes, Paul is saying that it's some level everybody knows there's a God. But as we're going to see in a minute, he's also saying at a profound level,  everybody, we all believe in God yet we don't believe in God. And what's interesting, the translators can never get this right  because it's a very awkward construction. But Paul deliberately, when he says, what may be known about God, is plain to them.

For since the creation of the world's invisible qualities,  eternal power, have been clearly seen, being understood,  the verbs there are present passive participles in Greek. And what it means is, and this is what the commentators say,  what it means is that the reality of God bears down on us constantly. That is that there's part of our heart that doesn't believe God's there  and yet there's another part of our heart that's sensitive to his reality  and that reality bears down on us. So what Paul is describing is a deeply conflicted dialogue between the part of our hearts  that denies the existence of God and the part of our hearts that's sensitive to his reality. There's nothing casual or shallow about that.

And yet Paul is saying that at some level, in some part of our heart, we know God's there. Now you say, what's the evidence for that? See, we're not talking here, you can look at the arguments for God and infer his existence. We're saying, Paul is saying that all people already know about his existence. At some level, they know he's there.

Well, what's the evidence for that? I have, after many, many years of finding it interesting to read the biographies  of atheists who have become Christians. I see what Paul is talking about. There's a whole slew of prominent, some more famous than others,  British intellectuals who are atheists and who became Christians. I mean, some of them are more famous like T.S.

Eliot, W.H. Auden, I see a slew. Some are a little less famous like C.E.M. Joan, A.N. Wilson.

People like they all have initials, lots of initials there. But a lot of these were British intellectuals, brilliant men,  and they were biographers in literary critics and thinkers and that sort of thing in poets. And even though they had rejected Christianity growing up and they became part of the intellectual elites,  all of whom laughed at religion and Christianity, they shocked their contemporaries and their peers  by embracing Christianity in one form or another. When I look at them and I study them, I see that very seldom, if ever,  do they look at the evidence like the cosmologic argument and the teleological argument  and they come to conclude, I guess there's a God. Rather, when they talk about how they found faith, they come to say,  they come to see that they believed God all along, they were living as if there was a God.

They weren't admitting that they were living as if there was a God  and they finally admitted he's got to be there. Very interesting. Let me just give you two. One is not as interesting and not as well known as the other. A.N.

Wilson, he's more recent. A.N. Wilson was a... Kathy, I know him because he really turned on Christianity  and he wrote a terrible biography of C.S. Lewis, basically attacking him for his beliefs.

He wrote biographies of Jesus of Paul, he was very skeptical of Christianity, rejected it,  very brilliant man, but on Easter 2009 he put an article in the paper said,  I have embraced Christianity, just shocked everybody and gave an Easter testimony. And in it, this is what he said, he says most public voices he's talking about in Britain. Most public voices have accepted the idea that only stupid people actually believe in Christianity. As a matter of fact, it's materialist atheism that is not merely an arid creed but is totally irrational. For materialist atheism says, we are just a collection of chemicals.

It has no answer whatsoever to the question of how we should be capable of love or heroism  or poetry if we are simply animated pieces of meat. And he goes on and tries to say, he says, people who believe there is no God  and that we are just... what he called us, we're just bags of chemicals  and animated pieces of meat that have evolved. Then we say we need to be noble and we need to believe in justice  and we need to love each other and he says there's no basis for that. Now you say where does that come from? Let me give you a second case study because it's a little clearer and more fascinating.

W.H. Auden, a poet, was considered one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th century. What's interesting to me is that his conversion happened right here in the Upper East Side years ago. He was British but he was living in America during World War II and he had embraced atheism  just like everybody in his intellectual class. But it started evidently when he was... you know that just the northern part of the Upper East Side,  sort of the north eastern part of the Upper East Side, Yorkville was back in World War II  and in the 30s and 40s a very, very German place.

Lots and lots of German people lived here. And there were a lot of... in fact, when we got here to start the church,  there were still lots and lots of German-speaking churches and restaurants and places like that  still in the late 80s up in the Upper East Side largely vanished. But during the 40s W.H. Auden went to... he was working on his German actually  and there were a number of German cinemas, places that show German films. And he went into a film house somewhere in the late 30s and saw a film that obviously had been influenced by Nazism  and he saw... he saw American Jew...

German people, American... German American people,  these Germans living in America, yelling at the screen slurs against the Jews that appeared in this story. And it shook him. And eventually this is what he wrote. He came back to Christianity, shocked everybody and this is what he wrote.

Let me set this up for you because it's very important. Auden thought that all educated and lightened people would believe in freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. Basically believe that all educated people, all cultured people, you know, all reasonable people,  people who believed in the importance of human reason and who are cultured,  that they would believe in the values of freedom, reason, democracy, and human dignity. What happened was that Germany had embraced Nazism and Germany was second to none as a sophisticated, educated society,  tremendous science, tremendous music, tremendous art, scholarship. You know Germany was second to none and yet they had embraced the idea that you should... well, that loving your neighbor and justice and human rights was a fiction.

So this is what Odin wrote. It created a crisis for him and here's what he wrote. If I'm convinced that the highly educated Nazis are wrong and that we highly educated English are right, what is it that validates our values and invalidates theirs? The English intellectuals who now cry to heaven against the evil incarnated in Hitler have no heaven to cry to. The whole trend of liberal thought has been to undermine faith in the absolute.

It is tried to make reason the judge. But either we serve the unconditional absolute or some Hitler monster will supply an iron convention based on reason to do evil by. And here's what he means. He says he believed in human rights liberty and freedom. Why?

Why should you believe in human rights and freedom? Why? Especially, let's use your reason, huh? And let's look at nature. But what you see, when you look at nature, reason looks at nature.

It's science and empirical. What do you see? You see the strong eating the weak. That's nature. That's how you got here.

The strong eating the weak. So now on what basis do you see a strong country eating a weak country or a strong race eating a weaker race, you know, destroying a pressing mark, on what basis do you say that's wrong? What reason? See, you're just using your reason, not morality, not heaven, not moral absence, just your reason. How do you decide that human freedom and dignity and human rights and justice for all?

Why believe that when that's not how nature works? He says Hitler was using reason. And reason is, hey, we're products of evolution. And so here's basically what he says. Yeah.

Of course, without God, you can have moral feelings. Oh, listen carefully, everybody. Without God, you can have moral feelings. Sure. You can feel it's wrong to oppress people.

You can feel human rights are right, okay? But without God, there can be no moral obligation. That is you have no right to say that your moral feelings should determine them, their behavior. See, you have moral feelings, your English, they have moral feelings, they're Nazis and they're Germans. How dare you say that your moral feelings are right and there's a wrong?

When there's no standard. And therefore, here's what he decided, if you believe that human rights and justice are not imaginary values, but are real. And if there is no God, they would be imaginary, but they're not imaginary. Therefore, there must be a God. Without God, there can be moral feelings, but there can't be moral obligation.

You can't say you are obliged to follow my moral feelings. But if you believe, well, they genocide is wrong. Oppression is wrong. Human rights are right. They're not just my feelings.

They're right. There must be a God. And Auden realized he was believing God all along. He just wasn't being honest with himself. We know there's a God.

Deep down. We suppress it. But that's the third point. See, the other thing that is so brilliant about Paul's analysis is, is the human condition. We can know God.

And we do know there's a God. And yet, we don't know there's a God. See, when he says, in the very moment he says, we do know God. He also says, we suppress it. We repress it.

So we don't know it. And yet we do know it. And yet we don't know it. And both are fundamentally the same. I mean, they're equally strong.

Now, what kind of stuff do we modern people know? We tend to suppress or repress. Why do you suppress something? Why do you repress something? If it's traumatic.

Now, sometimes memories can be traumatic. One of my favorite Agatha Christie novels is Sleeping Murder. And it's about a young woman who buys a house. And in the house she starts to have flashbacks of a murder she saw. And it turns out that as a little girl, she was in the house and she'd repress the memories of a murder.

And that's how the murder works. Now, the fact is that psychologists will tell you that there's really probably not that many truly repressed memories that are traumatic. I mean, there's a lot of fiction about it and there are a lot of people talk about it in the media. But the reality is it's probably not true that some memories are so traumatic. We simply repress them.

It's pretty rare. But I'll tell you what you do repress. If you're really angry, you can repress that. No, I'm not that angry. If you're really feeling guilty about something you've done, you can repress that.

No, I don't really feel guilty. Anything about your heart that doesn't fit in with your identity, your way that you'd like to think about who you are. So you have a chosen identity. I like to think of myself as this or as this or this. And when data comes in, things that you've done or feelings you've got that doesn't fit that data, you screen it out, you suppress it, you repress it.

And Paul says that's exactly what we're doing with God. Why? Because the knowledge of God is incredibly traumatic. So it tells you right here, verse 21, key verse. For although they knew God, they didn't glorify God.

And what's glorify me? They didn't treat God as as big and as glorious as He truly is, as multi-dimensional, as great, as magnificent as He is. Why? Because they didn't want to thank Him. Now you might say, what?

That's the big sin. That's the whole problem. We don't want to thank God. Yeah. By the way, even at the legal level, there's this thing called plagiarism.

What's plagiarism? For refusing to thank somebody, for the intellectual property you're ripping off, refusing to thank somebody saying, and I want to acknowledge that I got all these ideas from so we don't say that. Why? Because then we are showing our dependence and showing our obligation and showing we may actually not have complete control over what we're saying. But you see, if there's a God, then we are utterly dependent on Him.

And we are totally obliged to Him. See, if there's a God who made us and keeps us alive every second, then that's traumatic because it means we need to thank Him for everything, which means there's not a single spot in your life that you don't owe Him allegiance. And we hate that. Because our image of who we are is that we can call the shots. We are our own masters.

We decide what is right or wrong, especially our Western culture tells us that. And so along comes the God of the Bible in particular. And there is no God that's more traumatic than the God of the Bible. Why? Well, see, what if you say, well, I believe in a God of love, just a God that's a spirit of love everywhere.

See, that does not get in the first way. You don't have to thank that person, do you? That's not a person. You're still in control. You can still live with the illusion that you're in charge of your life.

Or if you believe there's other kinds of God, I just believe that God is the force of life and everything. There's all sorts of ways of believing in God that are traumatic and that we embrace, but the God of the Bible or put it like this. Imagine you had this really great scam going. There was a neighborhood in New York City that you go to and you dress up as a police officer. You impersonate a police officer.

And the waters park when you go there and they, you know, people give you free sandwiches and they. Top of the morning to you officer and you know, everything goes really nicely. Now, while you're, while you're impersonating the police officer, you'll probably be a little nervous. You'll be a little afraid that maybe you'll say something that might make, you know, somebody say, what, why would a police officer say this? You're a little nervous, of course, because you're impersonating an officer.

But what if in the distance coming walking towards you, you see a real police officer. You're not just nervous now. You're scared. Why? Because there's no chance that the real police officer is going to expose you as an impersonator.

It will happen. Therefore, all human beings, according to Paul, we want to call the shots. We want to be our own bosses. We want to be in control of our lives. We want to take credit.

So that's cosmic plagiarism. We want to take credit for who we are and what we've done. We want to pat ourselves on the back in all those ways. What are we doing? We're impersonating a god.

We're impersonating a creator. You know, we're self-made people and we're worshiping our creator. But what happens? See, when somebody comes along, says, I believe in a god who kind of made the world and now he's off in the, he's a remote or somebody says, I believe in a nature, a god who is nature, I believe in this, I believe. There's a whole lot of gods that actually don't threaten you.

But when you get to the biblical god who creates you and sustains you who is a glorious god and who you to whom you owe everything, that is a god who's going to freak you out. You're going to melt down. That's like when you're impersonating a police officer and you see a real police officer coming, you're impersonating a god. And when you see the real god coming, the biblical god coming, you go nuts. And Paul says, that's the reason why even though we know there's a god and we actually, in some ways, live as if there's a god.

We were honest with ourselves. We can't not know that there's a god. It presses his reality presses on us all the time. At the same time, we desperately do not want to believe in God. Everybody in this room, including the guy behind the microphone right now, it says, suppresses the truth to some degree.

None of us can bear the full reality of who God is. It's too threatening. It's too traumatic. We all try to whittle God down somehow, flatten him. But the biblical god, very traumatic.

And so though we can know God and we do know God, we don't know God. Well, what do we do about it? What can we do about it? Well, there actually is clues here as to what we can do about it and how we can truly know the god who's really there, how we can heal ourselves of our fears so that we can know him truly. And what is that?

Well, let me put it like this. This in some ways gets into the rest of the book of Romans and we're not looking at the whole book of Romans. But let me show you, let's go back to verse 1920 for a minute and say, if you look at nature, he says, if you look at creation, if you look at the things that have been made, what can you learn about God? He's invisible. He's eternal.

He's powerful. He's divine. Okay. What's missing from the list? Is there anything there that it says you can't know about God just by looking at nature, just by using your reason, just by using all your rational powers, by trying to be objective?

No matter how hard you try, looking at the things that are made, there's one thing you're not going to know anything about. What is it? Does anything about his love or his grace? And probably that's true. Let's look at nature class.

Let's look at a geologically. Oh, look at the volcanoes. Look at the earthquakes. Do you just look at that and just say, I just see that God is a God of love. No.

Let's look at the nature meteorologically. Hurricanes, see, you know, tsunamis. Do you just look at nature and say, you just, I just know God is a God of love. Let's look at it astronomically. You know, we're in a galaxy.

Our galaxy is just, you know, zillions and zillions of miles wide. We, and there are 100 billion galaxies we even know of, and we only probably know of a tiny amount of how many there really are. And do you look at that and the idea that there's a God who made all that, you just look at that and say, oh, I just really want to know a God like that. No, you're scared to death. If there is a God that made all that, what am I?

Let's look at it biologically. You know, Annie Dillard wrote a great book, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, and went out to live, you know, in the mountains of Virginia years ago. She won a Pulitzer Prize for the book, and she said, I wanted to observe nature. So she watched at the creek. She watched nature.

She thought it would make her close to nature, and she saw how violent nature was. She saw a giant water bug sting and paralyze a frog, and then put its thing down into its brain and suck its brains out until it sort of collapsed like a piece of clothing with nobody in it. And she said, oh, nature. Do you look at nature, read and tooth and claw, and say, oh, I just know God is a God of love. No, you will not find that God is a God of love.

In fact, now this is a little more controversial. I'm going to take 20 seconds on it. I promise I can back it up, but I'll just tell you, do you look at other religions? And say, well, other religions all say God is a God of love. No, you go to Buddhism.

They talk about being compassionate if you're a Buddhist. Of course, but it's because this world is unreal, and you shouldn't grab hold of anything. And the idea is that God is an impersonal soul, and we're going to become impersonal souls. No, they don't believe God is a God of love. In fact, if you talk to Islam, you say, do you believe your God is a God of love?

They'll talk about being merciful, but I know with many, many Muslims I've talked to is God a God of love. They said, no, we wouldn't say that. So where do you get this idea that God is a God of love? It's so pervasive in the world. I'll tell you where you get the idea.

It comes from the Bible. That's the only source in human thought. But if you really don't just pull what you want out of the Bible and really find the biblical God, here's what you see. Verse 18, wrath. A wrathful God, a God who gets angry at sin, a God who gets incredibly angry at sin.

And a little later on in Romans 3, it'll say, in the wages of sin is death. Wrath, demanding death because we disobey him. And then yet, look, verse 16, 17, but I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it's the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes. See, first the Jew, the good person, then the Gentile, the pagan person, it doesn't matter.

For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed. A righteousness is not earned, not something that you develop, but is given as a gift. It's by faith, from first to last. And you will live by it. Now here's the point.

When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control. You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great.

It's great. Why? Because the other person loses control, too. You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God.

A God of love. Yeah, you know what? You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control. And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are.

That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating. But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control.

Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit. He's nailed. He loses complete control.

Why? He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death. In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control.

So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us. Now, what is that? That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that.

No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to. The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself. There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God.

Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid. And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you. It's just too great.

Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you. It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross. And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says. That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers.

What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes. Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes.

My humiliation? Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot. I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death. That's wrong.

It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die. For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ. The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was.

But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself?

Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love? That was Father Martin's answer.

Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God. In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord. Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are.

We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

今天的经文来自罗马书第一章16到21节。我不以福音为耻,因为这福音是神的大能,要救一切相信的人,先是犹太人,后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来,这义是本于信,以致于信,如经上所记:"义人必因信得生。"原来,神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上,就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里,因为神已经给他们显明。

自从造天地以来,神的永能和神性是明明可知的,虽是眼不能见,但借着所造之物就可以晓得,叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神,却不当作神荣耀他,也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄,无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的道。我们现在是在一个系列的第四周,这个系列叫做"公开的信仰,分享内心的盼望"。每一周在小组里,我们都在讨论周日早晨我们在这里讨论的内容。我们并不生活在一个鼓励人们公开表达自己宗教信仰和宗教信念的社会中,这真的很讽刺,因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开表达其他所有事情。我们必须告诉人们我们是谁,但想一想。

没有什么比你的宗教信仰更能从根本上决定你的身份和你是谁。因此,如果我们要有一个真正开放和多元化的社会,我们都必须学会如何公开表达我们是谁,表达我们最深层的信仰,但要以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来做。这就是我们在这些早晨信息和每周小组中正在探索的。现在,这一周我们想谈谈如何谈论神以及神的存在?如果你要公开谈论信仰,你不能不谈论神的存在,但你怎么做才不会陷入一场争吵,就像这样。

神确实存在。不,神不存在。这就是互联网上的情况,你知道吗?有时候实际上在这条街上,我认为让人们更有思考性的方法之一,不是问"神存在吗",而是问"你怎么知道?你怎么知道神是否存在?"

你怎么知道神?或者如果你说你无法知道有没有神,你怎么知道这个?你看,一旦你开始问这个问题,"你怎么知道有没有神",或者"你怎么知道你能不能知道有没有神?"这就会让事情慢下来,让人们反思得更多一些。没有比罗马书第一章更好、更巧妙、更杰出的答案来回答这个问题了。

你怎么能知道有没有神,就在罗马书第一章这个特定部分,由圣保罗写的。我认为没有比这里更杰出、更巧妙的答案来回答"我们怎么能知道有没有神"这个问题了。因为保罗实际上一次性给了你四个答案,所以我们要全部来看。

就在这几节经文中,他说了什么。他说,我们可以知道神。我们确实知道神。我们不知道神。而且我们可以真正知道神。

我们确实知道神。顺便说一下,我们同时不知道神,而且有一种方法可以真正认识神。他在这里全都说了。让我们来看一看。首先,正如我所说,他确实在这里说你可以知道有神。

例如,著名的19和20节。神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里,自从造天地以来,神的永能和神性是明明可知的,虽是眼不能见,但借着所造之物就可以晓得。现在,他在说什么?他说,在所造之物中,也就是自然界,被造的世界。有线索,明显的线索,指向神的存在。

他实际上是在说,从你在自然界中看到的东西,可以推断出神的存在。现在,我用"线索"这个词的原因是,很多人有时候把这些线索错误地称为"证据"。所以有些人说,通过观察自然和世界,你可以证明有神。如果你上网,或者如果你去翻任何哲学教科书,他们会给你那些证据。从观察自然和被造的秩序得出的证据,这些证据有很长的名字。

如果你知道怎么说它们,你会对自己感觉好很多。这真的有助于你的自尊。所以有宇宙论论证,还有目的论论证。现在,保罗在这里没有使用"证据"这个词。我认为那是读得太深了。

证据是任何理性的人都无法否认的东西。任何理性的人都找不到任何理由不相信它。我不认为保罗在说这个。我认为他实际上是在说,如果我们的认知能力,我们的心智处于更好的状态,我们会更容易承认那些线索。但它们在那里。

它们是什么?嗯,我宁愿,他没有告诉你太多。他只是说神的实在性、神性和祂的能力,有线索指向它。我只花一分钟讲两个,只是向你展示它是如何运作的。但它们不是证据,而是线索。

宇宙论论证是这样运作的。怎么可能从无中生有?就是这样。例如,你知道,大爆炸理论,宇宙始于一次爆炸。无怎么可能爆炸?

你知道,无不能爆炸。那么爆炸怎么可能从无中产生?嗯,有人说,嗯,不是什么都没有。有某种东西。好的,但那个东西从哪里来?

一旦你不断问这个问题,那个东西从哪里来?它来自那个,那个东西又从哪里来?如果你一直追溯到说,嗯,有某种没有原因的东西,它不是从无中来的,它一直存在,因为我们不知道这个世界上有那样的东西。我们知道的一切都有开始。我们知道的一切都是有原因的结果。

一旦你开始谈论无因之因,一旦你开始谈论一直存在的东西,你就是在谈论超自然的东西。说,某种我们在自然界中不知道的东西,某种超越自然的东西,某种神圣的东西。你看,这就是宇宙论论证的方式。它说,这一切怎么可能从无中来?如果它不是从无中来,那么是什么带来了它?

目的论论证实际上也很有趣。再说一次,我看着我的手表。它们只是有趣。如果它们不足以让人们相信神,它们还没有做到。但线索确实存在。

目的论论证来自希腊词telos,意思是设计。它谈论世界如此完美地被设计,怎么可能是偶然产生的?现在物理学家会告诉你,我必须看着我的笔记才能正确地说出来,物理学的基本规律和常数,比如光速、引力常数、弱核力和强核力的强度,所有这些东西都必须完美校准。就像有一百个旋钮,每一个旋钮都必须精确地在正确的位置,没有一个可以偏离一丝一毫。它们都必须如此完美地校准,才能让物质凝聚,除非所有这些东西都完全是它们现在的样子,我们不会有物质,我们不会有世界,我们不会有人类生命。

所以很多人说,太多的事情必须精确地按照它们现在的方式发生,无论是人类生命,甚至是生命,甚至是物质,这不可能是偶然发生的。所以神做了这件事。这就是目的论论证。现在像理查德·道金斯或斯蒂芬·霍金这样的无神论者,花很多时间反驳那个论证,你知道那意味着什么吗?这意味着它一定有力量,否则他们不会花时间。

但你知道他们都说什么吗?道金斯说什么,你知道斯蒂芬·霍金说什么吗?他们说,在大爆炸时,可能形成了无限数量的可能宇宙,而我们恰好在物质凝聚的宇宙中,在那里所有各种物理学的基本规律和常数都恰好是生命发生所需的样子。所以我们在这里。有无数个宇宙,我们恰好在发生这种情况的那一个。

当然,很多哲学家对此玩得很开心。我只给你讲一个。约翰·莱斯利是一位哲学家,他给你讲这个故事。约翰·莱斯利给你讲这个故事。他说,想象有一个人即将被处决。

所以这个中士召集了50名神枪手,让他们在距离囚犯六英尺的地方排成一排。所以50名神枪手拿着步枪,距离囚犯六英尺,准备,瞄准,开火。他们全都没打中。中士说,发生了什么?每个人都说,天哪,中士,我的鼻子抽搐了一下,你知道,眼睛里进东西了,你知道,对不起,50个人同时。

中士说,不可能50个人同时。然后一个上过哲学课的人说,但是中士,在大爆炸时,可能形成了数以亿计的可能宇宙。而我们恰好在所有50名神枪手恰好都鼻子抽搐的那个宇宙中。现在,你知道,首先,中士,如果他也上过哲学课,他必须说,你说得对,我无法证明这是阴谋。因为我们恰好可能在那一个宇宙中,对吧?

我无法证明,但我知道这是阴谋。我永远不会,一百万年里,假设我们恰好在所有这些都能发生的那一个宇宙中是不合理的。我会假设这是阴谋。是有人做的。是被设计的,有某种个人行为,有某种个人设计参与其中,对吧?

他不会假设万亿分之一的机会发生了。他会假设这是个人设计。而你说,有万亿分之一的机会可能没有神。把你的整个生命建立在那上面有意义吗?所以这些是宇宙论和目的论论证。

这些基本上是人们多年来看到的各种线索的形式。保罗说它们在那里。它们确实是我们的线索。但保罗说的比那更激进。更激进得多。

因为他不只是说通过观察自然可以知道神。他实际上更进一步,远远超出那个,说每个人实际上确实知道神。看到他在哪里说的吗?他说神是愤怒的。他为什么愤怒?

神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上。这是每个人,全人类,那些阻挡真理的人。什么真理?关于神可以知道的。然后在第21节,他说,因为他们虽然知道神,却不当作神荣耀祂。

他在说的是,人们,所有人都在压制关于神存在的真理。现在,你不能压制你没有的东西。他在说的是,在非常深的层面上,每个人都知道神在那里。现在,顺便说一下,这对人们来说是一个非常冒犯的陈述。事实上,就在昨天的报纸上,在昨天的《纽约时报》上,有一封致编辑的信。

这封致编辑的信与我碰巧错过的某篇评论文章有关。但某个评论人本周早些时候在一篇评论文章中用了这个术语,说"战壕里没有无神论者"。你听说过。当枪战开始时,甚至无神论者也表明他们实际上相信神,嗯,一位无神论者写信来,他非常生气,这是他说的。这很公平。

他说,引用,他说,暗示无神论者内心都是有神论者,我们的信念是随意和浅薄地持有的,在逆境面前很容易被抛弃,这根本不是真的。他说,他是无神论者。他说,说我内心真的是有神论者,我的无神论,我的信念,我们的信仰,是随意和浅薄地持有,很容易被抛弃。这根本不是真的。嗯,你看保罗没有说那样的话。

保罗在说什么。是的,保罗在说在某个层面上每个人都知道有神。但正如我们一会儿要看到的,他也在说在深刻的层面上,每个人,我们都相信神,但我们不相信神。有趣的是,翻译者永远无法把这个翻译对,因为这是一个非常别扭的结构。但保罗故意,当他说,神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里。

因为自从造天地以来,不可见的品质,永能,是明明可知的,被理解,那里的动词在希腊语中是现在被动分词。这意味着,评论家们说,这意味着神的实在性不断地向我们压来。也就是说,我们心中有一部分不相信神在那里,但我们心中还有另一部分对祂的实在性敏感,那个实在性向我们压来。所以保罗描述的是我们心中否认神存在的部分和对祂的实在性敏感的部分之间深刻冲突的对话。这里面没有什么随意或浅薄的。

然而保罗在说,在某个层面上,在我们心中的某个部分,我们知道神在那里。现在你说,这有什么证据?你看,我们这里不是在谈论,你可以看神的论证并推断祂的存在。我们在说,保罗在说所有人已经知道祂的存在。在某个层面上,他们知道祂在那里。

嗯,证据是什么?多年来,我发现阅读从无神论者变成基督徒的人的传记很有趣。我看到保罗在谈论什么。有一大批著名的,有些比其他人更出名的,英国知识分子,他们是无神论者,后来成为基督徒。我是说,他们中一些更出名,比如T.S.艾略特,W.H.奥登,我看到一大批。有些不太出名,比如C.E.M.乔恩,A.N.威尔逊。

他们都有首字母缩写,很多首字母缩写。但这些英国知识分子中有很多,聪明的人,他们是传记作家、文学评论家、思想家和诗人之类的。尽管他们在成长过程中拒绝了基督教,成为知识精英的一部分,所有人都嘲笑宗教和基督教,但他们以某种形式拥抱基督教,震惊了他们的同时代人和同行。当我观察他们并研究他们时,我看到很少,如果有的话,他们会看宇宙论论证和目的论论证这样的证据,然后得出结论,我想有神。相反,当他们谈论他们如何找到信仰时,他们开始说,他们开始看到他们一直相信神,他们一直像有神一样生活。

他们没有承认他们像有神一样生活,他们最终承认祂一定在那里。非常有趣。让我给你举两个例子。一个不那么有趣,也不那么出名。A.N.威尔逊,他更近期。A.N.

威尔逊是一个...凯西,我认识他是因为他真的转而反对基督教,他写了一本糟糕的C.S.路易斯传记,基本上因为他的信仰而攻击他。他写了耶稣和保罗的传记,他对基督教非常怀疑,拒绝它,非常聪明的人,但在2009年复活节,他在报纸上发表了一篇文章说,我已经拥抱了基督教,震惊了所有人,并给出了复活节见证。在其中,他说,他说大多数公众声音,他在谈论英国。大多数公众声音都接受了只有愚蠢的人才真正相信基督教的观念。事实上,唯物主义无神论不仅是一个贫瘠的信条,而且是完全不理性的。因为唯物主义无神论说,我们只是一堆化学物质。

它对我们如何能够有爱或英雄主义或诗歌这个问题完全没有答案,如果我们只是有生命的肉块。他继续说,他说,相信没有神的人,我们只是...他称我们为,我们只是一袋化学物质和有生命的肉块,是进化来的。然后我们说我们需要高尚,我们需要相信正义,我们需要彼此相爱,他说这没有基础。现在你说这从哪里来?让我给你第二个案例研究,因为它更清楚,更引人入胜。

W.H.奥登,一位诗人,被认为是20世纪最杰出的作家之一。对我来说有趣的是,他的归信就发生在多年前的上东区。他是英国人,但在二战期间住在美国,他拥抱了无神论,就像他那个知识阶层的每个人一样。但它显然开始于他...你知道上东区的北部,上东区的东北部,约克维尔在二战期间和30年代、40年代是一个非常非常德国化的地方。

很多很多德国人住在这里。有很多...事实上,当我们来这里开始教会时,在80年代末的上东区仍然有很多很多讲德语的教会、餐馆和类似的地方,现在大部分消失了。但在40年代,W.H.奥登去...他在学德语,有一些德国电影院,放映德国电影的地方。他在30年代末走进一家电影院,看了一部显然受到纳粹主义影响的电影,他看到...他看到美国犹太人...

德国人,美国...德裔美国人,这些住在美国的德国人,在银幕上对出现在这个故事中的犹太人大喊侮辱。这震撼了他。最终这是他写的。他回到基督教,震惊了所有人,这是他写的。

让我为你设置一下背景,因为这非常重要。奥登认为所有受过教育和开明的人都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严。基本上相信所有受过教育的人,所有有文化的人,你知道,所有理性的人,相信人类理性重要性的人,有文化的人,他们会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严的价值。发生的事情是德国拥抱了纳粹主义,而德国作为一个复杂、受过教育的社会是首屈一指的,在科学、音乐、艺术、学术方面都很出色。你知道德国是首屈一指的,但他们却拥抱了...嗯,拥抱了你应该...嗯,爱你的邻居、正义和人权是虚构的观念。

所以这是奥登写的。这给他造成了危机,这是他写的。如果我确信受过高等教育的纳粹是错的,而我们受过高等教育的英国人是对的,是什么验证了我们的价值观并使他们的价值观无效?现在向天呼喊反对希特勒所体现的邪恶的英国知识分子没有天堂可以呼喊。自由主义思想的整个趋势一直在削弱对绝对的信仰。

它试图让理性成为判断者。但要么我们服务于无条件的绝对,要么某个希特勒怪物会提供一个基于理性的铁的惯例来作恶。这就是他的意思。他说他相信人权、自由和自由。为什么?

你为什么应该相信人权和自由?为什么?特别是,让我们用你的理性,嗯?让我们看看自然。但你看到什么,当你看自然,理性看自然。

这是科学和经验主义。你看到什么?你看到强者吃弱者。那就是自然。那就是你怎么来到这里的。

强者吃弱者。那么现在你基于什么说一个强国吃弱国或一个强种族吃弱种族,你知道,摧毁压迫标记,你基于什么说那是错的?什么理性?你看,你只是用你的理性,不是道德,不是天堂,不是道德缺席,只是你的理性。你如何决定人的自由、尊严、人权和对所有人的正义?为什么相信那个,当那不是自然运作的方式?他说希特勒在使用理性。理性是,嘿,我们是进化的产物。所以这基本上是他说的。是的。

当然,没有神,你可以有道德感受。哦,仔细听,各位。没有神,你可以有道德感受。当然。你可以感觉压迫人是错的。

你可以感觉人权是对的,好吗?但没有神,就不能有道德义务。也就是说,你没有权利说你的道德感受应该决定他们的行为。你看,你有道德感受,你是英国人,他们有道德感受,他们是纳粹,他们是德国人。当没有标准时,你怎么敢说你的道德感受是对的,他们的是错的?

因此,这是他决定的,如果你相信人权和正义不是想象的价值,而是真实的。如果没有神,它们会是想象的,但它们不是想象的。因此,一定有神。没有神,可以有道德感受,但不能有道德义务。

你不能说你有义务遵循我的道德感受。但如果你相信,嗯,种族灭绝是错的。压迫是错的。人权是对的。它们不只是我的感受。

它们是对的。一定有神。奥登意识到他一直相信神。他只是对自己不诚实。我们知道有神。

在内心深处。我们压制它。但这是第三点。你看,保罗分析的另一个如此杰出的地方是人类的状况。我们可以知道神。

我们确实知道有神。然而,我们不知道有神。你看,当他说,就在他说我们确实知道神的那一刻。他也说,我们压制它。我们压抑它。

所以我们不知道它。然而我们确实知道它。然而我们不知道它。两者根本上是一样的。我是说,它们同样强烈。

现在,我们现代人知道什么样的东西?我们倾向于压制或压抑。你为什么压制某件事?你为什么压抑某件事?如果它是创伤性的。

现在,有时记忆可能是创伤性的。我最喜欢的阿加莎·克里斯蒂小说之一是《沉睡的谋杀》。它讲的是一个年轻女子买了一栋房子。在房子里,她开始有她看到的谋杀案的闪回。结果发现,作为一个小女孩,她在房子里,她压抑了谋杀的记忆。

这就是谋杀是如何运作的。现在,事实是心理学家会告诉你,真正可能没有那么多真正被压抑的创伤性记忆。我是说,有很多关于它的小说,媒体上有很多人谈论它。但现实是,一些记忆如此创伤性,我们只是压抑它们,这可能不是真的。这是相当罕见的。

但我告诉你你确实压抑什么。如果你真的生气,你可以压抑。不,我没有那么生气。如果你真的对你做的事感到内疚,你可以压抑。不,我真的不感到内疚。

任何关于你的心的事情,不符合你的身份,你喜欢思考自己是谁的方式。所以你有一个选择的身份。我喜欢把自己想成这样或那样。当数据进来时,你做过的事情或你有的感受不符合那个数据,你把它筛选出去,你压制它,你压抑它。

保罗说这正是我们对神所做的。为什么?因为对神的认识是非常创伤性的。所以它在这里告诉你,第21节,关键经文。因为他们虽然知道神,却不荣耀神。

什么是荣耀我?他们没有把神当作像祂真正那样伟大和荣耀,那样多维度、伟大、壮丽。为什么?因为他们不想感谢祂。现在你可能会说,什么?

那是大罪。那是整个问题。我们不想感谢神。是的。顺便说一下,即使在法律层面,有一种东西叫做剽窃。什么是剽窃?拒绝感谢某人,拒绝感谢某人说你正在盗用的知识产权,我想承认我从那里得到了所有这些想法,我们不说那个。为什么?因为那样我们就显示了我们的依赖性,显示了我们的义务,显示我们实际上可能对我们所说的没有完全的控制。但你看,如果有神,那么我们完全依赖祂。

我们完全有义务对祂。你看,如果有一位神造了我们,每一秒都让我们活着,那么那是创伤性的,因为这意味着我们需要为每件事感谢祂,这意味着在你生命中没有一个地方你不欠祂忠诚。我们讨厌那个。因为我们对自己的形象是我们可以做主。我们是自己的主人。

我们决定什么是对或错,特别是我们的西方文化告诉我们那个。所以圣经的神特别出现。特别是圣经的神。没有哪个神比圣经的神更具创伤性。为什么?嗯,你看,如果你说,嗯,我相信一位爱的神,只是一位到处都是爱的灵的神。你看,那根本不碍事。你不必感谢那个人,是吗?那不是一个人。你仍然在控制。你仍然可以活在你掌管自己生命的幻觉中。

或者如果你相信有其他种类的神,我只是相信神是生命的力量和一切。有各种相信神的方式是创伤性的,我们拥抱,但圣经的神或者这样说。想象你有这个非常棒的骗局。有一个纽约市的社区,你去那里,你装扮成警察。你冒充警察。

当你去那里,沃特斯公园,你知道,人们给你免费三明治。他们。早上好,警官,你知道,一切都很好。现在,当你,当你冒充警察时,你可能会有点紧张。你会有点害怕,也许你会说一些可能让,你知道,有人说,什么,为什么警察会说这个?你有点紧张,当然,因为你在冒充警官。但如果在远处朝你走来,你看到一个真正的警察。你现在不只是紧张。你害怕。为什么?因为真正的警察肯定会揭露你是冒充者。

会发生的。因此,根据保罗的说法,所有人类,我们想做主。我们想成为自己的老板。我们想控制自己的生活。我们想要功劳。

所以那是宇宙剽窃。我们想为我们是谁和我们做了什么而邀功。我们想拍拍自己的背,在所有那些方面。我们在做什么?我们在冒充神。我们在冒充创造者。你知道,我们是自力更生的人,我们在敬拜我们的创造者。但发生了什么?你看,当有人来说,我相信一位神,他造了世界,现在他在远处,他很遥远,或者有人说,我相信自然,一位就是自然的神,我相信这个,我相信。有很多神实际上不会威胁你。

但当你接触到创造你、维持你的圣经的神,祂是荣耀的神,你欠祂一切,那是一位会让你抓狂的神。你会崩溃。那就像当你冒充警察,你看到一个真正的警察走来,你在冒充神。当你看到真正的神来临,圣经的神来临,你会发疯。保罗说,这就是为什么即使我们知道有神,实际上,在某些方面,我们像有神一样生活。

我们对自己诚实。我们不能不知道有神。祂的实在性一直向我们压来。同时,我们拼命不想相信神。这个房间里的每个人,包括现在在麦克风后面的这个人,在某种程度上压制真理。

我们没有人能承受神完全的实在性。太威胁了。太创伤性了。我们都试图以某种方式削减神,使祂扁平化。但圣经的神,非常创伤性。

所以虽然我们可以知道神,我们确实知道神,我们不知道神。嗯,我们能做什么?我们能做什么?嗯,这里实际上有线索,关于我们能做什么以及我们如何能真正认识真正存在的神,我们如何能治愈我们的恐惧,以便我们能真正认识祂。那是什么?

嗯,让我这样说。这在某些方面涉及罗马书的其余部分,我们不是在看整本罗马书。但让我告诉你,让我们回到19、20节一分钟,说,如果你看自然,他说,如果你看创造,如果你看被造之物,你能学到关于神的什么?祂是不可见的。祂是永恒的。

祂是有能力的。祂是神圣的。好的。列表中缺少什么?有什么是说你不能仅仅通过看自然就知道关于神的吗,仅仅使用你的理性,仅仅使用你所有的理性能力,试图客观?

无论你多么努力,看着被造之物,有一件事你不会知道任何东西。那是什么?关于祂的爱或祂的恩典有什么吗?那可能是真的。让我们来看自然课。让我们从地质学角度看。哦,看火山。看地震。你只是看那个,就说,我只是看到神是爱的神。不。

让我们从气象学角度看自然。飓风,你看,你知道,海啸。你只是看自然,说,你只是,我只是知道神是爱的神。让我们从天文学角度看。你知道,我们在一个星系中。我们的星系只是,你知道,数万亿英里宽。我们,有1000亿个我们甚至知道的星系,我们可能只知道实际有多少个的一小部分。你看那个,创造了这一切的神的想法,你只是看那个,说,哦,我只是真的想认识这样的神。不,你吓坏了。如果有一位神创造了这一切,我是什么?

让我们从生物学角度看。你知道,安妮·迪拉德写了一本伟大的书,《廷克溪的朝圣者》,多年前出去住,你知道,在弗吉尼亚的山里。她因这本书赢得了普利策奖,她说,我想观察自然。所以她在小溪边观察。她观察自然。

她以为那会让她亲近自然,她看到自然有多暴力。她看到一只巨大的水虫蜇并麻痹了一只青蛙,然后把它的东西放进它的大脑里,吸出它的大脑,直到它像一件没有人在里面的衣服一样坍塌。她说,哦,自然。你看自然,血腥和牙齿爪子,说,哦,我只是知道神是爱的神。不,你不会发现神是爱的神。

事实上,现在这有点更有争议性。我要花20秒说这个。我保证我能支持它,但我只是告诉你,你看其他宗教吗?然后说,嗯,其他宗教都说神是爱的神。不,你去佛教。他们谈论如果你是佛教徒要有慈悲。当然,但那是因为这个世界是不真实的,你不应该抓住任何东西。这个想法是神是一个非人格的灵魂,我们将成为非人格的灵魂。不,他们不相信神是爱的神。事实上,如果你跟伊斯兰教谈,你说,你相信你的神是爱的神吗?

他们会谈论仁慈,但我和许多许多穆斯林交谈过,神是爱的神吗。他们说,不,我们不会那么说。那么你从哪里得到神是爱的神这个想法?它在世界上如此普遍。我告诉你你从哪里得到这个想法。

它来自圣经。那是人类思想中唯一的来源。但如果你真的不只是从圣经中拉出你想要的,真正找到圣经的神,这是你看到的。第18节,忿怒。一位忿怒的神,一位对罪愤怒的神,一位对罪极其愤怒的神。

在罗马书第3章后面一点,它会说,罪的工价就是死。忿怒,要求死,因为我们不服从祂。然而,看,第16、17节,但我不以福音为耻。因为这是神的大能,要将救恩带给每一个相信的人。看,先是犹太人,好人,然后是外邦人,异教徒,无所谓。

因为在福音中,神的义显明出来。义不是赚来的,不是你发展的东西,而是作为礼物给予的。这是本于信,以致于信。你将因此而活。现在重点来了。

当你在爱中把自己给某人,当你进入一段爱的关系,你把自己在爱中给某人,你会失去控制吗?是的,你失去控制。你不能只是以任何方式生活。当你进入一段爱的关系,你失去控制。这很好。

这很好。为什么?因为对方也失去控制。你不是,如果这是真正的爱的关系,你们不互相剥削。如果你只是仰望天空说,我想相信一位爱的神,听着,那只是使神扁平化。一位爱的神。是的,你知道吗?你害怕失去控制。你和我害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说,我只是相信一位爱的神,祂不审判任何人,接受每个人就像他们现在的样子。

那是一位扁平的神,不会威胁你。他们不会揭露你在冒充的事实。但圣经的神,福音的神是这样的。祂是一位愤怒的神,因为祂对罪愤怒,然而耶稣基督,神的儿子,来到这个世界,去十字架,失去控制。完全控制。

每个人都对祂为所欲为。祂被殴打。祂是精神。祂被钉。祂失去完全控制。

为什么?祂承受我们应得的。祂承受那忿怒。祂承受那死亡。换句话说,神的儿子,道成肉身的神,如此爱我们,祂愿意失去控制。

这样祂就能重新承受我们的惩罚,这样祂就能宽恕我们,爱我们。现在,那是什么?那是一种不剥削的爱。你看,你可以把自己给这位神,因为祂为你上了十字架。你看,没有其他宗教有类似的东西。没有其他哲学有类似的东西。现在,最后,我有一位神,我可以把自己给祂。福音和爱的神和圣洁的神的福音,一位如此圣洁以至于必须惩罚罪的神,一位如此充满爱以至于会亲自承受惩罚的神。在那里你现在有了一位荣耀的神。你有了一位多维度的神,一位复杂的神,一位真正有位格的神。

一个我可以认识的人,也是一位我可以把自己给祂而不害怕的神。所以福音治愈了使我无法真正认识神的恐惧。它是独特的。我最喜欢的部分,事实上,在小说《少年Pi的奇幻漂流》中我唯一喜欢的部分,是这一个地方,我得读给你听。太棒了。

每隔几年,我得出来读给你听。这是男孩探索所有不同宗教的地方,他倾向于印度教,但后来他和一位天主教神父交谈,神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和祂在十字架上的死。这是男孩,他抓狂了,这是他说的。神会忍受逆境,我能理解。印度教的神面对他们应得的那份小偷、恶霸、绑匪和篡位者。《罗摩衍那》是什么,不就是罗摩漫长糟糕一天的记录吗?逆境?是的。命运逆转?是的,背叛,是的。

我的羞辱?死亡?我无法想象主克里希纳同意被剥光衣服、鞭打、嘲笑、拖过街道,最重要的是,被钉十字架,而且是在仅仅人类的手中。我从未听说过印度教神死亡,但神性不应该被死亡摧毁。那是错的。

这位基督教的神让祂的化身死是错的。那就等于让祂自己的一部分死。因为如果儿子要死,那不能是假的。如果十字架上的神是神在扮演人类悲剧,那就把基督的受难变成了基督的闹剧。儿子的死必须是真的,马丁神父向我保证那是真的。

但一旦是死的神,就永远是死的神,即使复活了,这个儿子口中必须永远有死亡的味道。三位一体必须被它玷污。神父右手边一定有某种臭味。恐怖必须是真的。神为什么要把那个加在自己身上?为什么不让死亡留给凡人?为什么要弄脏美丽的东西?为什么要毁坏完美的东西?爱?那是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的父,我们看到,通过扫视天空、使用我们的理性和理性论证,我们永远不会学到的,是神牺牲的爱。在耶稣基督里,主,除了在福音中,我们永远不会知道那个,但那是我们需要来治愈我们心的。所以我们对你的原始和深刻的内在认识,最终可以自由地释放。我们害怕你,主。我们害怕失去控制。你的实在性,你荣耀的实在性,对我们来说太创伤了,但只有在福音中我们才能被治愈,我们才能拥抱你,最终与我们的创造者、我们的造物主、我们的救赎主、我们被造来敬拜、爱和认识的那一位重新联合。哦,主。教导我们如何公开表达我们的信仰,我们这些理解福音并经历过那种治愈的人。教导我们在我们心中使用福音,这样我们就可以不断获得对你实在性更好、更荣耀的看法,因为即使现在,主,我们很多人,我们是信徒,但我们仍然没有完全掌握你是谁的伟大。我们有时仍然扭曲那个,父,教导我们如何公开表达我们的信仰,这样其他人就可以知道通过看到你儿子耶稣基督的福音、祂的爱而来的心的治愈,我们奉祂的名祷告。阿们。

今天的经文来自罗马书第1章第16至21节。我不以福音为耻，因为这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来，这义是本于信，以至于信，如经上所记："义人必因信得生。"原来，神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为神已经给他们显明。

自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但藉着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的道。我们正在进行一个系列的第四周，这个系列叫做"公共信仰——分享内心的盼望"，每周在小组中我们都会讨论周日早晨在这里所谈论的内容。我们生活的社会并不鼓励人们公开表达自己的宗教信仰和宗教信念，这真是很讽刺，因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开表达其他一切事情。我们必须告诉别人我们是谁，但想想看。

没有什么比你的宗教信仰更能从根本上定义你的身份和你是谁了。因此，如果我们要建立一个真正开放和多元的社会，我们都必须学会如何公开表达我们是谁，表达我们最深层的信仰信念，同时以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来做到这一点。这就是我们在这些早晨信息和每周小组中所探讨的内容。本周，我们想谈谈如何谈论神以及神的存在？如果你要公开谈论信仰，就不能不谈论神的存在，但你如何做到这一点而不会

变成了一场激烈的争吵，就像这样。

上帝确实存在。不，上帝不存在。这就是互联网上的景象，对吧？有时候在街上也是如此。我认为让人们更加深思的一个方法是，不要问"上帝是否存在"这个问题，而是问"你怎么知道？你怎么知道上帝是否存在？"

你怎么认识上帝？或者如果你说你无法知道是否有上帝，你又是怎么知道这一点的？看，一旦你开始问这个问题——你怎么知道是否有上帝，或者你怎么知道你能否知道是否有上帝？这就会让事情慢下来，让人们多思考一些。而对于这个问题，没有比罗马书第一章，特别是罗马书第一章的这一部分更好、更巧妙、更精彩的答案了。

你怎么能知道是否有上帝？由圣保罗所写的罗马书第一章给出了最精彩的答案。我认为关于"我们如何知道是否有上帝"这个问题，没有比这里更精彩、更巧妙的答案了。因为保罗实际上几乎同时给了你四个答案，所以我们要一一来看。

就在这几节经文中，他是这么说的。他说，我们能够认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝。而且我们能够真正地认识上帝。

我们确实认识上帝。顺便说一句，我们同时又不认识上帝，而且有一种方法可以真正认识上帝。他在这里全都说了。让我们来看一看。首先，正如我所说的，他确实在这里说你能够知道有一位上帝。

例如，那些著名的经文，它们都很有名，19节和20节。"神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但藉着所造之物就可以晓得。"现在，他在说什么呢？他说，在所造之物中，也就是大自然、被造的世界，有上帝存在的线索，明显的线索。

他实际上是在说，从你在大自然中所看到的，可以推断出上帝的存在。现在，我用"线索"这个词的原因是，许多人有时候，我认为，错误地将这些线索称为"证据"。所以有些人说，通过观察大自然和观察世界，你可以证明

有上帝的存在。如果你上网查询,或者翻开任何哲学教科书,他们都会给你这些证明。而那些通过观察自然和受造秩序得出的证明,这些证明都有很长的名称。

如果你知道怎么说出这些名称,你会对自己感觉好多了。这真的有助于提升你的自尊。比如宇宙论证,还有目的论证。现在,保罗在这里并没有使用"证明"这个词。我认为那样理解是过度解读了。

证明是指任何理性的人都无法否认的东西。任何理性的人都找不到任何理由不相信它。我不认为保罗是这个意思。我认为他实际上是在说,如果我们的认知能力,我们的心智处于更好的状态,我们会更容易承认那些线索。但它们确实存在。

它们是什么呢?嗯,我宁愿,他没有告诉你太多。他只是说上帝的真实性,神性和祂的能力,都有线索可寻。我只花一分钟讲讲这两个论证,让你看看它们是如何运作的。但它们不是证明,而是线索。

宇宙论证是这样运作的。无中怎能生有?就是这样。比如,你知道,大爆炸理论,宇宙始于一场爆炸。虚无怎么能爆炸呢?

你知道,虚无是不能爆炸的。那么这场爆炸怎么能从虚无中产生呢?有人会说,嗯,并不是什么都没有。是有东西的。好吧,但那个东西从哪里来的?

当你不断问这个问题的时候,那个东西从哪里来?它来自那个,那个东西又从哪里来?如果你一直追溯回去说,嗯,有某个东西是没有原因的,它不是从虚无中产生的,它一直就在那里,而我们知道在这个世界上没有这样的东西。我们所知道的一切都有开始。我们所知道的一切都是有原因的结果。

一旦你开始谈论无因之因,一旦你开始谈论某个没有,一直就存在的东西,你就是在谈论超自然的东西。也就是说,某个我们在自然界不知道的东西,某个超越自然的东西,

某种神圣的存在。看,这就是宇宙论证的论证方式。它说,这一切怎么可能从虚无中来?如果它不是从虚无中来的,那是什么创造了它?

目的论证实际上也很有趣。同样,我看着我的手表。它们确实很有趣。如果它们不足以让人相信上帝,它们确实没有做到。但线索就在那里。

目的论证来自希腊词telos,意思是设计。它讨论的是世界被如此完美地设计,怎么可能是偶然形成的?现在物理学家会告诉你这一点,我必须看着我的笔记才能正确地说出来,宇宙的基本规律和常数,比如光速、引力常数、弱核力和强核力的强度,所有这些东西都必须完美地校准。这几乎就像有一百个刻度盘,每个刻度盘都必须恰好在正确的位置,一个都不能偏离一丝一毫。它们都必须如此完美地校准,以便物质能够凝聚,除非所有这些东西都恰好是现在的样子,我们不会有物质,我们不会有世界,我们不会有人类生命。

所以许多人说,太多的事情必须恰好以现在的方式发生,无论是人类生命,甚至是生命,甚至是物质,这不可能是偶然发生的。所以上帝创造了它。这就是目的论证。现在像理查德·道金斯或斯蒂芬·霍金这样的无神论者,花了很多时间反驳这个论证,你知道这意味着什么吗?这意味着它一定有说服力,否则他们不会花时间。

但你知道他们都说什么吗?道金斯说什么,你知道斯蒂芬·霍金说什么吗?他们说在大爆炸时,可能形成了无限数量的可能宇宙,而我们恰好在这个物质能够凝聚的宇宙中,在这个宇宙中,各种基本的物理规律和常数恰好是生命发生所需要的样子。所以我们就在这里。有无数个这样的宇宙,而我们只是

恰好处在这个一切都发生的宇宙中。

当然，许多哲学家对此有很多有趣的论述。我只给你们讲一个。约翰·莱斯利是一位哲学家，他给你讲了这样一个故事。约翰·莱斯利告诉你这个故事。他说，想象有一个人即将被处决。

于是这位中士找来50名神枪手，让他们在距离囚犯六英尺的地方排成一排。所以50名神枪手拿着步枪，距离囚犯六英尺，准备，瞄准，开火。结果他们全都没打中。中士问道，发生了什么事？每个人都说，天啊，中士，我的鼻子刚好抽动了一下，你知道的，眼睛里进了东西，你知道的，对不起，50个人同时都这样。

中士说，不可能50个人同时这样。然后有个上过哲学课的人说，但是中士，在大爆炸的时候，可能形成了无数个可能的宇宙。而我们恰好处在这个宇宙中，在这个宇宙里，50名神枪手恰好在同一时刻，你知道的，鼻子都抽动了一下。现在，你知道，首先，如果中士也上过哲学课，他必须说，你说得对，我无法证明这是一场阴谋。因为我们可能恰好处在这个唯一的宇宙中，对吧？

我无法证明，但我知道这是一场阴谋。我永远不会，在一百万年里，假设我们恰好处在这个一切都可能发生的唯一宇宙中是不合理的。我要你假设这是一场阴谋。是有人做的。是精心策划的，有某种个人行为，有某种个人设计参与其中，对吧？

他不会假设这个万亿分之一的概率恰好发生了。他会假设这是一个个人设计。而你说，有万亿分之一的可能也许没有上帝。把你的整个生命建立在这个假设上有意义吗？所以这些就是宇宙论和目的论的论证。

这些基本上就是人们多年来所看到的那些线索的形式。保罗说它们就在那里。它们确实是我们的线索。但保罗说的比这更激进。激进得多。

因为他不只是说通过观察有可能认识上帝

论本性。实际上他更进一步，远远超过那个程度，说每一个人实际上都知道神的存在。看到他说的了吗？他说神是愤怒的。为什么祂愤怒呢？

神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些压制真理的人。这是每个人，全人类，压制真理的人。什么真理？关于神可知的事。然后在第21节，他说，因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀祂。

他所说的是，人们，所有的人都在压制关于神存在的真理。现在，你不能压制你没有的东西。而他所说的是，在某个非常深的层面，每一个人都知道神在那里。顺便说一句，这对人们来说是一个非常冒犯性的陈述。事实上，就在昨天的报纸上，在昨天的《纽约时报》上，有一封致编辑的信。

这封致编辑的信是关于我碰巧错过的某篇专栏文章。但某位专栏作家在本周早些时候的一篇专栏文章中用了这样一个词，说"战壕里没有无神论者"。你听过这句话。就是说当枪声响起时，即使是无神论者也会显示出他们实际上相信神的存在，嗯，一位无神论者写信来表达他非常生气，这是他说的话。这是公平的。

他说，引用他的话，他说，暗示无神论者在内心深处都是有神论者，我们的信念是随意和肤浅地持有的，在逆境面前很容易被放弃，这简直不是真的。他说，他是一位无神论者。他说，说我在内心深处真的是一个有神论者，我的无神论，我的信念，我们的信念是随意和肤浅地持有的，很容易被放弃。这就不是真的。嗯，看，保罗并没有说任何类似的话。

保罗说的是这样的。是的，保罗说的是，在某个层面上每个人都知道有一位神。但正如我们马上要看到的，他也在说，在一个深刻的层面上，每个人，我们所有人都相信神，但又不相信神。有趣的是，翻译者们永远无法正确翻译这个，因为这是一个非常尴尬的结构。但保罗故意这样说，当他说，关于神可知的事，向他们显明。

因为自从创造世界以来，神那看不见的品质、永恒的权能，都已经清楚地显明出来，被人所领悟。这里的动词在希腊文中是现在被动分词。注释家们说，这意味着神的真实性不断地压在我们身上。也就是说，我们内心的一部分不相信神的存在，但另一部分却对祂的真实性敏感，而这个真实性不断地压在我们身上。所以保罗所描述的，是我们内心中否认神存在的那部分与对祂的真实性敏感的那部分之间，一场深刻而矛盾的对话。这绝不是什么随便或肤浅的事。

然而保罗在说，在某种程度上，在我们内心的某个部分，我们知道神在那里。现在你说，这有什么证据呢？看，我们这里谈论的不是，你可以看看神存在的论证并推断出祂的存在。我们说的是，保罗在说所有人已经知道祂的存在。在某种程度上，他们知道祂在那里。

那么，这有什么证据呢？多年来，我发现阅读从无神论者成为基督徒的人的传记很有意思。我看到了保罗所说的。有一大批杰出的英国知识分子，有些比其他人更有名，他们曾是无神论者后来成了基督徒。我是说，他们中有些更有名，比如艾略特（T.S. Eliot）、奥登（W.H. Auden），我看到一大批。有些不太有名，比如琼（C.E.M. Joad）、威尔逊（A.N. Wilson）。

这些人名字都有很多首字母缩写。但很多这些英国知识分子都是杰出的人物，他们是传记作家、文学批评家、思想家和诗人之类的。尽管他们成长过程中拒绝了基督教，成为了知识精英的一部分——那些嘲笑宗教和基督教的人，但他们以某种形式接受基督教，震惊了他们的同代人和同行。当我观察和研究他们时，我发现他们很少（如果有的话）会去看宇宙论论证和目的论论证这些证据，然后得出结论说，我

猜想有神存在。相反，当他们谈到如何找到信仰时，他们会说，他们意识到自己一直都相信神，他们一直在按照有神的方式生活。

他们没有承认自己在按照有神的方式生活，最终他们承认了祂必定存在。非常有意思。让我给你们举两个例子。一个不那么有趣，也不那么为人所知。A.N. 

Wilson，他是比较近期的人物。A.N. Wilson曾经是……凯茜，我知道他是因为他真的转而反对基督教，他写了一本可怕的C.S.路易斯传记，基本上攻击他的信仰。

他写过耶稣和保罗的传记，他对基督教非常怀疑，拒绝接受它，非常聪明的人，但在2009年复活节，他在报纸上发表了一篇文章说，我已经拥抱了基督教，震惊了所有人，并给出了复活节的见证。在文章中，他是这样说的，他说大多数公众声音——他指的是在英国。大多数公众声音都接受了这样的观念：只有愚蠢的人才真正相信基督教。事实上，唯物主义无神论不仅是一种贫瘠的信条，而且是完全非理性的。因为唯物主义无神论说，我们只是一堆化学物质。

它完全无法回答这个问题：如果我们只是有生命的肉块，我们怎么可能有爱或英雄主义或诗歌呢。他继续说，他说，那些相信没有神的人，相信我们只是……他称我们为，我们只是一袋袋化学物质，是进化而来的有生命的肉块。然后我们说我们需要高尚，我们需要相信正义，我们需要彼此相爱，他说这没有任何基础。现在你说这从何而来？让我给你们举第二个案例研究，因为它更清晰、更引人入胜。

W.H. 奥登，一位诗人，被认为是20世纪最杰出的作家之一。对我来说有趣的是，他的皈依就发生在多年前的上东区这里。他是英国人，但二战期间住在美国，他曾拥抱无神论，就像他那个知识阶层的所有人一样。但这显然开始于当他

是……你知道上东区的北部，大概是上东区的东北部，约克维尔在二战期间以及三四十年代是一个非常非常德国化的地方。

有非常非常多的德国人住在这里。而且有很多……实际上，当我们来到这里建立教会的时候，在八十年代末的上东区仍然有很多很多讲德语的教会、餐馆和类似的地方，后来基本上都消失了。但在四十年代，W.H.奥登去……他当时在学德语，那里有一些德国电影院，放映德国电影的地方。他在三十年代末的某个时候走进了一家电影院，看到了一部显然受到纳粹主义影响的电影，他看到……他看到美国犹太人……

德国人，美国……德裔美国人，这些生活在美国的德国人，对着银幕上出现在这个故事里的犹太人大喊侮辱性的话。这震撼了他。最终，这就是他所写的。他回归了基督教，震惊了所有人，这是他写下的东西。

让我为你铺垫一下，因为这非常重要。奥登认为所有受过教育和开化的人都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严。基本上相信所有受过教育的人，所有有文化的人，你知道，所有理性的人，那些相信人类理性重要性并且有文化修养的人，都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严这些价值观。但发生的事情是，德国拥抱了纳粹主义，而德国作为一个成熟、受过良好教育的社会是首屈一指的——拥有卓越的科学、卓越的音乐、卓越的艺术、学术成就。你知道德国是首屈一指的，然而他们却拥抱了这样的思想：你应该……嗯，爱邻舍、公正和人权是虚构的。

所以这是奥登写的。这给他造成了一场危机，这是他写的。如果我确信那些受过高等教育的纳粹是错的，而我们这些受过高等教育的英国人是对的，那么是什么验证了我们的价值观而使他们的价值观无效呢？现在向天哭诉邪恶的英国知识分子

化身为希特勒的却没有天堂可以哀求。自由主义思想的整个趋势一直是在削弱对绝对真理的信仰。

人们试图让理性成为审判者。但我们要么服从无条件的绝对真理，要么就会有某个希特勒式的怪物提供一个基于理性的铁腕传统来作恶。这就是他的意思。他说他相信人权、自由和自由。为什么？

你为什么要相信人权和自由？为什么？特别是，让我们用你的理性，嗯？让我们看看自然。但当你观察自然时，你看到了什么，理性观察自然。

这是科学和经验主义的。你看到了什么？你看到强者吃弱者。这就是自然。这就是你如何来到这里的。

强者吃弱者。那么现在，你凭什么说一个强国吃掉一个弱国，或者一个强大的种族吃掉一个较弱的种族，你知道，摧毁压迫的标记，你凭什么说这是错的？什么理由？看，你只是在使用你的理性，不是道德，不是天堂，不是道德的缺席，只是你的理性。你如何决定人类的自由和尊严、人权和对所有人的正义？

当这不是自然运作的方式时，为什么要相信这些？他说希特勒在使用理性。而理性是，嘿，我们是进化的产物。所以基本上他是这样说的。是的。

当然，没有上帝，你可以有道德感受。哦，大家仔细听。没有上帝，你可以有道德感受。当然。你可以感觉到压迫人是错误的。

你可以感觉到人权是对的，好吗？但没有上帝，就不能有道德义务。也就是说，你没有权利说你的道德感受应该决定他们的行为。看，你有道德感受，你是英国人，他们有道德感受，他们是纳粹和德国人。你怎么敢说你的道德感受是对的，而他们的是错的？

当没有标准的时候。因此，这是他的决定，如果你相信人权和正义不是想象的价值，而是真实的。如果没有上帝，它们就会是想象的，但它们不是想象的。因此，必定有一位上帝。没有上帝，可以有道德感受，但不能有道德义务。

你不能说你

必须遵循我的道德感受。但如果你相信，种族灭绝是错误的。压迫是错误的。人权是对的。它们不仅仅是我的感受。

它们是对的。那么一定有一位上帝。奥登意识到他一直都相信上帝。他只是没有对自己诚实。我们知道有一位上帝。

在内心深处。我们压抑它。但这就是第三点。你看，保罗对人类处境的分析如此精辟的另一点是。我们能够认识上帝。

而且我们确实知道有一位上帝。然而，我们又不知道有一位上帝。你看，当他说的那一刻，我们确实认识上帝。他同时也说，我们压抑它。我们抑制它。

所以我们不知道它。然而我们又知道它。然而我们又不知道它。而且两者在根本上是相同的。我的意思是，它们同样强烈。

现在，我们现代人知道什么样的东西？我们倾向于压抑或抑制。你为什么要压抑某些东西？你为什么要抑制某些东西？如果它是创伤性的。

现在，有时记忆可能是创伤性的。我最喜欢的阿加莎·克里斯蒂小说之一是《沉睡的谋杀案》。它讲述了一个年轻女子买了一栋房子。在房子里，她开始对她看到的一起谋杀案产生闪回。结果是，当她还是个小女孩时，她在房子里，她压抑了对一起谋杀案的记忆。

这就是这起谋杀案的运作方式。现在，事实是心理学家会告诉你，真正的创伤性压抑记忆可能并没有那么多。我的意思是，有很多关于它的小说，媒体上也有很多人谈论它。但现实是，有些记忆如此创伤以至于我们简单地压抑它们，这可能不是真的。

这相当罕见。但我会告诉你，你确实会压抑什么。如果你真的很生气，你可以压抑它。不，我没有那么生气。如果你对自己所做的事情真的感到内疚，你可以压抑它。

不，我并不真的感到内疚。任何关于你内心的事情，如果不符合你的身份认同，不符合你想要认为自己是谁的方式。所以你有一个选定的身份。我喜欢把自己想成这样或那样或这样。当数据进来时，你所做的事情或你所拥有的感受，如果不符合

那些数据，你会筛选掉它，你会压制它，你会抑制它。

保罗说这正是我们对上帝所做的事。为什么？因为对上帝的认识是极其创伤性的。所以经文在这里，第21节，关键经文。尽管他们认识上帝，他们却没有荣耀上帝。

荣耀是什么意思？他们没有按照上帝真正的伟大和荣耀来对待祂，没有按照祂多维度的、伟大的、宏伟的本质来对待祂。为什么？因为他们不想感谢祂。现在你可能会说，什么？

这就是大罪。这就是整个问题所在。我们不想感谢上帝。是的。顺便说一下，即使在法律层面，有一种叫做抄袭的东西。

什么是抄袭？拒绝感谢某人，拒绝为你盗用的知识产权感谢某人，拒绝说，我想承认我从某处得到了所有这些想法。我们不说这些。为什么？因为那样我们就显示了我们的依赖性，显示了我们的义务，显示了我们可能实际上无法完全控制我们所说的话。但你看，如果有一位上帝，那么我们就完全依赖于祂。

我们对祂负有全部责任。看，如果有一位创造了我们并每一秒都让我们活着的上帝，那么这是创伤性的，因为这意味着我们需要为每一件事感谢祂，这意味着在你生命中没有一个地方是你不欠祂忠诚的。而我们憎恨这一点。因为我们对自己的形象是我们可以做主。我们是自己的主人。

我们决定什么是对或错，特别是我们的西方文化告诉我们这一点。然后圣经的上帝就出现了。没有比圣经的上帝更具创伤性的上帝了。为什么？嗯，看，如果你说，好吧，我相信一位爱的上帝，只是一位无处不在的爱的灵。

看，那根本不会妨碍你。你不必感谢那个人，对吧？那不是一个人。你仍然在掌控之中。你仍然可以活在你掌管自己生命的幻觉中。

或者如果你相信其他类型的神，我只是相信上帝是生命的力量和一切事物。有各种各样相信上帝的方式是创伤性的，而我们拥抱这些方式，但圣经的上帝

圣经，或者这样说。想象一下你有一个非常棒的骗局。在纽约市有一个社区，你去那里并打扮成警察。你冒充警察。

当你去那里的时候，人们把车停在路边，你知道，人们给你免费的三明治，他们说，早上好，警官，你知道，一切都进行得非常顺利。现在，当你在冒充警察的时候，你可能会有点紧张。你会有点害怕，也许你会说些什么可能会让某人说，什么，警察为什么要这样说？你当然会有点紧张，因为你在冒充警察。

但如果在远处，你看到一个真正的警察向你走来，会怎么样呢？你现在不只是紧张了。你会害怕。为什么？因为真正的警察肯定会揭穿你是个冒充者。

这是必然会发生的。因此，根据保罗的说法，所有人类，我们都想发号施令。我们想成为自己的老板。我们想掌控自己的生活。我们想要功劳。

所以这是宇宙性的剽窃。我们想要为我们是谁、我们做了什么而邀功。我们想在所有这些方面拍拍自己的后背。我们在做什么？我们在冒充神。

我们在冒充创造者。你知道，我们是自我造就的人，我们在敬拜我们的创造者。但会发生什么呢？看，当有人过来说，我相信一个创造了世界然后就离开的神，他很遥远，或者有人说，我相信大自然，一个与自然合一的神，我相信这个，我相信。有很多神实际上并不会威胁到你。

但当你遇到圣经中的神——他创造了你并维系着你，他是一位荣耀的神，你欠他一切——那是一位会让你吓坏的神。你会崩溃。这就像当你冒充警察时看到一个真正的警察走过来，你在冒充神。而当你看到真正的神——圣经中的神——走来时，你会发疯。保罗说，这就是为什么即使我们知道有一位神，我们

事实上，在某些方面，就好像有一位神存在一样地生活。

如果我们对自己诚实，我们无法不知道有一位神。他的真实性一直在向我们施压。与此同时，我们又极其不想相信神。在这个房间里的每个人，包括现在拿着麦克风的这个人，都在某种程度上压制着真理。

我们没有人能够承受神的全部真实。这太具威胁性了。这太创伤性了。我们都试图以某种方式削减神，将他扁平化。但圣经中的神，非常具有创伤性。

因此，虽然我们能够认识神，我们也确实认识神，但我们又不认识神。那么，我们该怎么办呢？我们能做什么呢？其实这里有一些线索，告诉我们可以做什么，以及我们如何能够真正认识那位真实存在的神，我们如何能够治愈我们的恐惧，从而能够真正地认识他。那是什么呢？

好吧，让我这样说。这在某些方面涉及到罗马书的其余部分，我们不会查看整卷罗马书。但让我给你们看，让我们回到第19-20节，如果你观察自然界，他说，如果你观察受造物，如果你观察那些被造之物，你能了解到神的什么？他是不可见的。他是永恒的。

他是大有能力的。他是神圣的。好的。清单上缺少了什么？仅仅通过观察自然界，仅仅通过使用你的理性，仅仅通过使用你所有的理性力量，通过试图保持客观，有什么是你无法知道关于神的事情吗？

无论你多么努力地尝试，观察那些被造之物，有一件事你无法了解任何信息。那是什么？关于他的爱或他的恩典有什么信息吗？这可能是真的。让我们来看看自然课。

让我们从地质学上来看。哦，看看火山。看看地震。你只是看着这些，然后就说，我看到神是一位慈爱的神吗？不会的。

让我们从气象学上来看自然界。飓风，你知道，海啸。你只是看着自然界然后说，你只是，我就知道神是一位慈爱的神吗？让我们从天文学上来看。你知道，我们在一个星系中。

我们的星系宽达亿万万英里。我们，而且

我们已知的就有一千亿个星系，而我们所知道的可能只是实际存在数量的冰山一角。当你看着这一切，想到有一位上帝创造了这一切，你会看着这一切说，哦，我真的很想认识这样一位上帝吗？不，你会被吓得要死。如果真有一位上帝创造了这一切，那我算什么？

让我们从生物学的角度来看。你知道，安妮·迪拉德写了一本很棒的书《廷克溪的朝圣者》，多年前她去弗吉尼亚的山区生活。她因这本书获得了普利策奖，她说，我想观察大自然。所以她在溪边观察。她观察大自然。

她以为这会让她接近大自然，但她看到了大自然有多么暴力。她看到一只巨大的水虫蜇伤并麻痹了一只青蛙，然后把它的器官伸进青蛙的大脑，吸出它的脑浆，直到青蛙像一件没有人穿的衣服一样瘪了下去。她说，哦，大自然。你看着大自然，血腥而残酷，你会说，哦，我就知道上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？不，你不会发现上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。

事实上，现在这个说法有点争议。我只花20秒谈谈。我保证我可以证明这一点，但我只想告诉你，你看看其他宗教？然后说，嗯，其他宗教都说上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。不，你去看佛教。

如果你是佛教徒，他们会谈论慈悲。当然，但那是因为这个世界是虚幻的，你不应该执着于任何事物。他们的观念是上帝是一个非人格的灵魂，而我们将成为非人格的灵魂。不，他们不相信上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。事实上，如果你跟伊斯兰教徒交谈，你说，你相信你的上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？

他们会谈论仁慈，但我跟许多许多穆斯林交谈过，上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？他们说，不，我们不会这么说。那么你从哪里得到上帝是一位慈爱的上帝这个观念呢？这个观念在世界上如此普遍。我告诉你从哪里得到的。

它来自圣经。那是人类思想中唯一的来源。但如果你真的不只是从圣经中抽取你想要的部分，而是真正找到圣经中的上帝，你会看到什么。第18节，

愤怒。一个发怒的神，一个对罪恶发怒的神，一个对罪恶极其愤怒的神。

在罗马书第三章稍后的部分，会说，罪的工价乃是死。愤怒，因为我们违背他而要求死亡。然而，看，16、17节，但我不以福音为耻。因为这是神的大能，要使一切相信的人得救。看，首先是犹太人，善良的人，然后是外邦人，异教徒，这都不重要。

因为在福音中，神的义显明出来。这义不是靠赚取的，不是你培养出来的，而是作为礼物赐给的。是本于信，以至于信。你将因此而活。现在重点来了。

当你在爱中把自己交给某个人时，当你进入一段爱的关系，并在爱中把自己交给某人时，你会失去控制吗？是的，你会失去控制。你不能想怎么活就怎么活。当你进入一段爱的关系时，你失去了控制。这很美好。

这很美好。为什么？因为另一个人也失去了控制。如果这是一段真正的爱的关系，你们不会彼此利用。如果你只是简单地仰望天空说，我想相信一位充满爱的神，听着，那只是把神扁平化了。

一位充满爱的神。是的，你知道吗？你害怕失去控制。你和我都害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说，我只相信一位不审判任何人、接纳每个人本来面目的充满爱的神。

那是一个扁平的神，不会威胁到你。他们不会揭露你在假装的事实。但圣经中的神，福音中的神是这样的。他是一位发怒的神，因为他对罪恶发怒，然而神的儿子耶稣基督来到这个世界，走上十字架，失去了控制。完全的控制。

每个人都对他为所欲为。他被殴打。他被羞辱。他被钉在十字架上。他失去了完全的控制。

为什么？他承受了我们应得的。他承受了那愤怒。他承受了那死亡。换句话说，神的儿子，道成肉身的神如此爱我们，以至于他愿意失去控制。

这样他就能承担我们的刑罚，这样他就能宽恕我们，爱我们。现在，这是什么？这是一种不利用人的爱。你看，你可以把自己交给

因为祂为你上了十字架，你可以来到这位神面前。你看，没有任何其他宗教有这样的东西。

没有任何其他哲学有这样的东西。现在，终于，我有了一位我可以把自己交托的神。福音，以及一位慈爱又圣洁的神的福音，一位如此圣洁以至于必须惩罚罪的神，一位如此慈爱以至于祂愿意亲自承受惩罚的神。现在你有了一位荣耀的神。你有了一位多维度的神，一位复杂的神，一位真正有位格的神。

一位我可以认识的神，也是一位我可以把自己交托而不必害怕的神。因此，那阻止我真正认识神的恐惧被福音医治了。这是独一无二的。我最喜欢的部分，事实上，在《少年Pi的奇幻漂流》这部小说中我唯一喜欢的部分，就是这一个地方，我得读给你们听。这太精彩了。

每隔几年，我就得拿出来读给你们听。这是那个男孩探索所有不同宗教的地方，他倾向于印度教，但后来他和一位天主教神父交谈，神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和祂在十字架上的死。男孩听了之后惊呆了，这是他说的话。神会忍受逆境，这我能理解。印度教的神明也遭遇过他们应得的盗贼、恶霸、绑匪和篡位者。

《罗摩衍那》不就是讲罗摩漫长而糟糕的一天吗？逆境？是的。命运逆转？是的，背叛，是的。

我的羞辱？死亡？我无法想象克里希纳神会同意被剥光衣服、被鞭打、被嘲笑、被拖着穿过街道，而且最重要的是，被钉十字架，而且还是在普通人类手中。我从未听说过印度教的神会死，但神性不应该被死亡玷污。那是错的。

这位基督教的神让祂的化身死去是错的。这等同于让祂自己的一部分死去。因为如果太阳要死，那不能是假的。如果十字架上的神是神在羞辱人类的悲剧，那就把基督的受难变成了基督的闹剧。太阳的死必须是真实的，马丁神父向我保证确实如此。

但一旦神死了，就永远是死过的神，即使复活了，这太阳的口中必定永远留有死亡的滋味。

三位一体必定会被它玷污。在父神的右边必定会有某种恶臭。这恐怖必定是真实的。为什么神会希望这发生在自己身上？

为什么不把死亡留给凡人呢？为什么要弄脏美丽的事物？为什么要糟蹋完美的事物？爱？这就是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的天父，我们看到，通过扫视诸天、运用我们的理性和理性论证，我们永远无法学到的，就是神牺牲的爱。在耶稣基督里，主啊，除了在福音中，我们永远无法知道这一点，但这正是我们医治内心所需要的。因此，我们对神、对你那原初的、深刻的、与生俱来的认识，终于可以自由地释放出来。主啊，我们害怕你。

我们害怕失去控制。你的真实，你荣耀的真实，对我们来说实在太创伤性了，但只有在福音中我们才能得到医治，才能拥抱你，最终与我们的创造者、我们的制造者、我们的救赎主、那位我们被造来敬拜、爱慕和认识的神重新联合。哦，主啊。教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，我们这些理解福音并经历过那种医治的人。教导我们在心中使用福音，这样我们就能不断获得对你真实性更美好、更荣耀的认识，因为即使现在，主啊，我们许多人，我们是信徒，但仍然没有完全把握你是谁的伟大。

我们有时仍然会扭曲这一点，父啊，求你教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，使其他人能够认识到通过看见你儿子耶稣基督的爱的福音而来的内心医治，我们奉祂的名祷告。阿们。

今天的经文来自罗马书第一章16到21节。我不以福音为耻,因为这福音是神的大能,要救一切相信的人,先是犹太人,后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来,这义是本于信,以致于信,如经上所记:"义人必因信得生。"原来,神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上,就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里,因为神已经给他们显明。

自从造天地以来,神的永能和神性是明明可知的,虽是眼不能见,但借着所造之物就可以晓得,叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神,却不当作神荣耀他,也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄,无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的道。我们现在是在一个系列的第四周,这个系列叫做"公开的信仰,分享内心的盼望"。每一周在小组里,我们都在讨论周日早晨我们在这里讨论的内容。我们并不生活在一个鼓励人们公开表达自己宗教信仰和宗教信念的社会中,这真的很讽刺,因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开表达其他所有事情。我们必须告诉人们我们是谁,但想一想。

没有什么比你的宗教信仰更能从根本上决定你的身份和你是谁。因此,如果我们要有一个真正开放和多元化的社会,我们都必须学会如何公开表达我们是谁,表达我们最深层的信仰,但要以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来做。这就是我们在这些早晨信息和每周小组中正在探索的。现在,这一周我们想谈谈如何谈论神以及神的存在?如果你要公开谈论信仰,你不能不谈论神的存在,但你怎么做才不会陷入一场争吵,就像这样。

神确实存在。不,神不存在。这就是互联网上的情况,你知道吗?有时候实际上在这条街上,我认为让人们更有思考性的方法之一,不是问"神存在吗",而是问"你怎么知道?你怎么知道神是否存在?"

你怎么知道神?或者如果你说你无法知道有没有神,你怎么知道这个?你看,一旦你开始问这个问题,"你怎么知道有没有神",或者"你怎么知道你能不能知道有没有神?"这就会让事情慢下来,让人们反思得更多一些。没有比罗马书第一章更好、更巧妙、更杰出的答案来回答这个问题了。

你怎么能知道有没有神,就在罗马书第一章这个特定部分,由圣保罗写的。我认为没有比这里更杰出、更巧妙的答案来回答"我们怎么能知道有没有神"这个问题了。因为保罗实际上一次性给了你四个答案,所以我们要全部来看。

就在这几节经文中,他说了什么。他说,我们可以知道神。我们确实知道神。我们不知道神。而且我们可以真正知道神。

我们确实知道神。顺便说一下,我们同时不知道神,而且有一种方法可以真正认识神。他在这里全都说了。让我们来看一看。首先,正如我所说,他确实在这里说你可以知道有神。

例如,著名的19和20节。神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里,自从造天地以来,神的永能和神性是明明可知的,虽是眼不能见,但借着所造之物就可以晓得。现在,他在说什么?他说,在所造之物中,也就是自然界,被造的世界。有线索,明显的线索,指向神的存在。

他实际上是在说,从你在自然界中看到的东西,可以推断出神的存在。现在,我用"线索"这个词的原因是,很多人有时候把这些线索错误地称为"证据"。所以有些人说,通过观察自然和世界,你可以证明有神。如果你上网,或者如果你去翻任何哲学教科书,他们会给你那些证据。从观察自然和被造的秩序得出的证据,这些证据有很长的名字。

如果你知道怎么说它们,你会对自己感觉好很多。这真的有助于你的自尊。所以有宇宙论论证,还有目的论论证。现在,保罗在这里没有使用"证据"这个词。我认为那是读得太深了。

证据是任何理性的人都无法否认的东西。任何理性的人都找不到任何理由不相信它。我不认为保罗在说这个。我认为他实际上是在说,如果我们的认知能力,我们的心智处于更好的状态,我们会更容易承认那些线索。但它们在那里。

它们是什么?嗯,我宁愿,他没有告诉你太多。他只是说神的实在性、神性和祂的能力,有线索指向它。我只花一分钟讲两个,只是向你展示它是如何运作的。但它们不是证据,而是线索。

宇宙论论证是这样运作的。怎么可能从无中生有?就是这样。例如,你知道,大爆炸理论,宇宙始于一次爆炸。无怎么可能爆炸?

你知道,无不能爆炸。那么爆炸怎么可能从无中产生?嗯,有人说,嗯,不是什么都没有。有某种东西。好的,但那个东西从哪里来?

一旦你不断问这个问题,那个东西从哪里来?它来自那个,那个东西又从哪里来?如果你一直追溯到说,嗯,有某种没有原因的东西,它不是从无中来的,它一直存在,因为我们不知道这个世界上有那样的东西。我们知道的一切都有开始。我们知道的一切都是有原因的结果。

一旦你开始谈论无因之因,一旦你开始谈论一直存在的东西,你就是在谈论超自然的东西。说,某种我们在自然界中不知道的东西,某种超越自然的东西,某种神圣的东西。你看,这就是宇宙论论证的方式。它说,这一切怎么可能从无中来?如果它不是从无中来,那么是什么带来了它?

目的论论证实际上也很有趣。再说一次,我看着我的手表。它们只是有趣。如果它们不足以让人们相信神,它们还没有做到。但线索确实存在。

目的论论证来自希腊词telos,意思是设计。它谈论世界如此完美地被设计,怎么可能是偶然产生的?现在物理学家会告诉你,我必须看着我的笔记才能正确地说出来,物理学的基本规律和常数,比如光速、引力常数、弱核力和强核力的强度,所有这些东西都必须完美校准。就像有一百个旋钮,每一个旋钮都必须精确地在正确的位置,没有一个可以偏离一丝一毫。它们都必须如此完美地校准,才能让物质凝聚,除非所有这些东西都完全是它们现在的样子,我们不会有物质,我们不会有世界,我们不会有人类生命。

所以很多人说,太多的事情必须精确地按照它们现在的方式发生,无论是人类生命,甚至是生命,甚至是物质,这不可能是偶然发生的。所以神做了这件事。这就是目的论论证。现在像理查德·道金斯或斯蒂芬·霍金这样的无神论者,花很多时间反驳那个论证,你知道那意味着什么吗?这意味着它一定有力量,否则他们不会花时间。

但你知道他们都说什么吗?道金斯说什么,你知道斯蒂芬·霍金说什么吗?他们说,在大爆炸时,可能形成了无限数量的可能宇宙,而我们恰好在物质凝聚的宇宙中,在那里所有各种物理学的基本规律和常数都恰好是生命发生所需的样子。所以我们在这里。有无数个宇宙,我们恰好在发生这种情况的那一个。

当然,很多哲学家对此玩得很开心。我只给你讲一个。约翰·莱斯利是一位哲学家,他给你讲这个故事。约翰·莱斯利给你讲这个故事。他说,想象有一个人即将被处决。

所以这个中士召集了50名神枪手,让他们在距离囚犯六英尺的地方排成一排。所以50名神枪手拿着步枪,距离囚犯六英尺,准备,瞄准,开火。他们全都没打中。中士说,发生了什么?每个人都说,天哪,中士,我的鼻子抽搐了一下,你知道,眼睛里进东西了,你知道,对不起,50个人同时。

中士说,不可能50个人同时。然后一个上过哲学课的人说,但是中士,在大爆炸时,可能形成了数以亿计的可能宇宙。而我们恰好在所有50名神枪手恰好都鼻子抽搐的那个宇宙中。现在,你知道,首先,中士,如果他也上过哲学课,他必须说,你说得对,我无法证明这是阴谋。因为我们恰好可能在那一个宇宙中,对吧?

我无法证明,但我知道这是阴谋。我永远不会,一百万年里,假设我们恰好在所有这些都能发生的那一个宇宙中是不合理的。我会假设这是阴谋。是有人做的。是被设计的,有某种个人行为,有某种个人设计参与其中,对吧?

他不会假设万亿分之一的机会发生了。他会假设这是个人设计。而你说,有万亿分之一的机会可能没有神。把你的整个生命建立在那上面有意义吗?所以这些是宇宙论和目的论论证。

这些基本上是人们多年来看到的各种线索的形式。保罗说它们在那里。它们确实是我们的线索。但保罗说的比那更激进。更激进得多。

因为他不只是说通过观察自然可以知道神。他实际上更进一步,远远超出那个,说每个人实际上确实知道神。看到他在哪里说的吗?他说神是愤怒的。他为什么愤怒?

神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上。这是每个人,全人类,那些阻挡真理的人。什么真理?关于神可以知道的。然后在第21节,他说,因为他们虽然知道神,却不当作神荣耀祂。

他在说的是,人们,所有人都在压制关于神存在的真理。现在,你不能压制你没有的东西。他在说的是,在非常深的层面上,每个人都知道神在那里。现在,顺便说一下,这对人们来说是一个非常冒犯的陈述。事实上,就在昨天的报纸上,在昨天的《纽约时报》上,有一封致编辑的信。

这封致编辑的信与我碰巧错过的某篇评论文章有关。但某个评论人本周早些时候在一篇评论文章中用了这个术语,说"战壕里没有无神论者"。你听说过。当枪战开始时,甚至无神论者也表明他们实际上相信神,嗯,一位无神论者写信来,他非常生气,这是他说的。这很公平。

他说,引用,他说,暗示无神论者内心都是有神论者,我们的信念是随意和浅薄地持有的,在逆境面前很容易被抛弃,这根本不是真的。他说,他是无神论者。他说,说我内心真的是有神论者,我的无神论,我的信念,我们的信仰,是随意和浅薄地持有,很容易被抛弃。这根本不是真的。嗯,你看保罗没有说那样的话。

保罗在说什么。是的,保罗在说在某个层面上每个人都知道有神。但正如我们一会儿要看到的,他也在说在深刻的层面上,每个人,我们都相信神,但我们不相信神。有趣的是,翻译者永远无法把这个翻译对,因为这是一个非常别扭的结构。但保罗故意,当他说,神的事情,人所能知道的,原显明在人心里。

因为自从造天地以来,不可见的品质,永能,是明明可知的,被理解,那里的动词在希腊语中是现在被动分词。这意味着,评论家们说,这意味着神的实在性不断地向我们压来。也就是说,我们心中有一部分不相信神在那里,但我们心中还有另一部分对祂的实在性敏感,那个实在性向我们压来。所以保罗描述的是我们心中否认神存在的部分和对祂的实在性敏感的部分之间深刻冲突的对话。这里面没有什么随意或浅薄的。

然而保罗在说,在某个层面上,在我们心中的某个部分,我们知道神在那里。现在你说,这有什么证据?你看,我们这里不是在谈论,你可以看神的论证并推断祂的存在。我们在说,保罗在说所有人已经知道祂的存在。在某个层面上,他们知道祂在那里。

嗯,证据是什么?多年来,我发现阅读从无神论者变成基督徒的人的传记很有趣。我看到保罗在谈论什么。有一大批著名的,有些比其他人更出名的,英国知识分子,他们是无神论者,后来成为基督徒。我是说,他们中一些更出名,比如T.S.艾略特,W.H.奥登,我看到一大批。有些不太出名,比如C.E.M.乔恩,A.N.威尔逊。

他们都有首字母缩写,很多首字母缩写。但这些英国知识分子中有很多,聪明的人,他们是传记作家、文学评论家、思想家和诗人之类的。尽管他们在成长过程中拒绝了基督教,成为知识精英的一部分,所有人都嘲笑宗教和基督教,但他们以某种形式拥抱基督教,震惊了他们的同时代人和同行。当我观察他们并研究他们时,我看到很少,如果有的话,他们会看宇宙论论证和目的论论证这样的证据,然后得出结论,我想有神。相反,当他们谈论他们如何找到信仰时,他们开始说,他们开始看到他们一直相信神,他们一直像有神一样生活。

他们没有承认他们像有神一样生活,他们最终承认祂一定在那里。非常有趣。让我给你举两个例子。一个不那么有趣,也不那么出名。A.N.威尔逊,他更近期。A.N.

威尔逊是一个...凯西,我认识他是因为他真的转而反对基督教,他写了一本糟糕的C.S.路易斯传记,基本上因为他的信仰而攻击他。他写了耶稣和保罗的传记,他对基督教非常怀疑,拒绝它,非常聪明的人,但在2009年复活节,他在报纸上发表了一篇文章说,我已经拥抱了基督教,震惊了所有人,并给出了复活节见证。在其中,他说,他说大多数公众声音,他在谈论英国。大多数公众声音都接受了只有愚蠢的人才真正相信基督教的观念。事实上,唯物主义无神论不仅是一个贫瘠的信条,而且是完全不理性的。因为唯物主义无神论说,我们只是一堆化学物质。

它对我们如何能够有爱或英雄主义或诗歌这个问题完全没有答案,如果我们只是有生命的肉块。他继续说,他说,相信没有神的人,我们只是...他称我们为,我们只是一袋化学物质和有生命的肉块,是进化来的。然后我们说我们需要高尚,我们需要相信正义,我们需要彼此相爱,他说这没有基础。现在你说这从哪里来?让我给你第二个案例研究,因为它更清楚,更引人入胜。

W.H.奥登,一位诗人,被认为是20世纪最杰出的作家之一。对我来说有趣的是,他的归信就发生在多年前的上东区。他是英国人,但在二战期间住在美国,他拥抱了无神论,就像他那个知识阶层的每个人一样。但它显然开始于他...你知道上东区的北部,上东区的东北部,约克维尔在二战期间和30年代、40年代是一个非常非常德国化的地方。

很多很多德国人住在这里。有很多...事实上,当我们来这里开始教会时,在80年代末的上东区仍然有很多很多讲德语的教会、餐馆和类似的地方,现在大部分消失了。但在40年代,W.H.奥登去...他在学德语,有一些德国电影院,放映德国电影的地方。他在30年代末走进一家电影院,看了一部显然受到纳粹主义影响的电影,他看到...他看到美国犹太人...

德国人,美国...德裔美国人,这些住在美国的德国人,在银幕上对出现在这个故事中的犹太人大喊侮辱。这震撼了他。最终这是他写的。他回到基督教,震惊了所有人,这是他写的。

让我为你设置一下背景,因为这非常重要。奥登认为所有受过教育和开明的人都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严。基本上相信所有受过教育的人,所有有文化的人,你知道,所有理性的人,相信人类理性重要性的人,有文化的人,他们会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严的价值。发生的事情是德国拥抱了纳粹主义,而德国作为一个复杂、受过教育的社会是首屈一指的,在科学、音乐、艺术、学术方面都很出色。你知道德国是首屈一指的,但他们却拥抱了...嗯,拥抱了你应该...嗯,爱你的邻居、正义和人权是虚构的观念。

所以这是奥登写的。这给他造成了危机,这是他写的。如果我确信受过高等教育的纳粹是错的,而我们受过高等教育的英国人是对的,是什么验证了我们的价值观并使他们的价值观无效?现在向天呼喊反对希特勒所体现的邪恶的英国知识分子没有天堂可以呼喊。自由主义思想的整个趋势一直在削弱对绝对的信仰。

它试图让理性成为判断者。但要么我们服务于无条件的绝对,要么某个希特勒怪物会提供一个基于理性的铁的惯例来作恶。这就是他的意思。他说他相信人权、自由和自由。为什么?

你为什么应该相信人权和自由?为什么?特别是,让我们用你的理性,嗯?让我们看看自然。但你看到什么,当你看自然,理性看自然。

这是科学和经验主义。你看到什么?你看到强者吃弱者。那就是自然。那就是你怎么来到这里的。

强者吃弱者。那么现在你基于什么说一个强国吃弱国或一个强种族吃弱种族,你知道,摧毁压迫标记,你基于什么说那是错的?什么理性?你看,你只是用你的理性,不是道德,不是天堂,不是道德缺席,只是你的理性。你如何决定人的自由、尊严、人权和对所有人的正义?为什么相信那个,当那不是自然运作的方式?他说希特勒在使用理性。理性是,嘿,我们是进化的产物。所以这基本上是他说的。是的。

当然,没有神,你可以有道德感受。哦,仔细听,各位。没有神,你可以有道德感受。当然。你可以感觉压迫人是错的。

你可以感觉人权是对的,好吗?但没有神,就不能有道德义务。也就是说,你没有权利说你的道德感受应该决定他们的行为。你看,你有道德感受,你是英国人,他们有道德感受,他们是纳粹,他们是德国人。当没有标准时,你怎么敢说你的道德感受是对的,他们的是错的?

因此,这是他决定的,如果你相信人权和正义不是想象的价值,而是真实的。如果没有神,它们会是想象的,但它们不是想象的。因此,一定有神。没有神,可以有道德感受,但不能有道德义务。

你不能说你有义务遵循我的道德感受。但如果你相信,嗯,种族灭绝是错的。压迫是错的。人权是对的。它们不只是我的感受。

它们是对的。一定有神。奥登意识到他一直相信神。他只是对自己不诚实。我们知道有神。

在内心深处。我们压制它。但这是第三点。你看,保罗分析的另一个如此杰出的地方是人类的状况。我们可以知道神。

我们确实知道有神。然而,我们不知道有神。你看,当他说,就在他说我们确实知道神的那一刻。他也说,我们压制它。我们压抑它。

所以我们不知道它。然而我们确实知道它。然而我们不知道它。两者根本上是一样的。我是说,它们同样强烈。

现在,我们现代人知道什么样的东西?我们倾向于压制或压抑。你为什么压制某件事?你为什么压抑某件事?如果它是创伤性的。

现在,有时记忆可能是创伤性的。我最喜欢的阿加莎·克里斯蒂小说之一是《沉睡的谋杀》。它讲的是一个年轻女子买了一栋房子。在房子里,她开始有她看到的谋杀案的闪回。结果发现,作为一个小女孩,她在房子里,她压抑了谋杀的记忆。

这就是谋杀是如何运作的。现在,事实是心理学家会告诉你,真正可能没有那么多真正被压抑的创伤性记忆。我是说,有很多关于它的小说,媒体上有很多人谈论它。但现实是,一些记忆如此创伤性,我们只是压抑它们,这可能不是真的。这是相当罕见的。

但我告诉你你确实压抑什么。如果你真的生气,你可以压抑。不,我没有那么生气。如果你真的对你做的事感到内疚,你可以压抑。不,我真的不感到内疚。

任何关于你的心的事情,不符合你的身份,你喜欢思考自己是谁的方式。所以你有一个选择的身份。我喜欢把自己想成这样或那样。当数据进来时,你做过的事情或你有的感受不符合那个数据,你把它筛选出去,你压制它,你压抑它。

保罗说这正是我们对神所做的。为什么?因为对神的认识是非常创伤性的。所以它在这里告诉你,第21节,关键经文。因为他们虽然知道神,却不荣耀神。

什么是荣耀我?他们没有把神当作像祂真正那样伟大和荣耀,那样多维度、伟大、壮丽。为什么?因为他们不想感谢祂。现在你可能会说,什么?

那是大罪。那是整个问题。我们不想感谢神。是的。顺便说一下,即使在法律层面,有一种东西叫做剽窃。什么是剽窃?拒绝感谢某人,拒绝感谢某人说你正在盗用的知识产权,我想承认我从那里得到了所有这些想法,我们不说那个。为什么?因为那样我们就显示了我们的依赖性,显示了我们的义务,显示我们实际上可能对我们所说的没有完全的控制。但你看,如果有神,那么我们完全依赖祂。

我们完全有义务对祂。你看,如果有一位神造了我们,每一秒都让我们活着,那么那是创伤性的,因为这意味着我们需要为每件事感谢祂,这意味着在你生命中没有一个地方你不欠祂忠诚。我们讨厌那个。因为我们对自己的形象是我们可以做主。我们是自己的主人。

我们决定什么是对或错,特别是我们的西方文化告诉我们那个。所以圣经的神特别出现。特别是圣经的神。没有哪个神比圣经的神更具创伤性。为什么?嗯,你看,如果你说,嗯,我相信一位爱的神,只是一位到处都是爱的灵的神。你看,那根本不碍事。你不必感谢那个人,是吗?那不是一个人。你仍然在控制。你仍然可以活在你掌管自己生命的幻觉中。

或者如果你相信有其他种类的神,我只是相信神是生命的力量和一切。有各种相信神的方式是创伤性的,我们拥抱,但圣经的神或者这样说。想象你有这个非常棒的骗局。有一个纽约市的社区,你去那里,你装扮成警察。你冒充警察。

当你去那里,沃特斯公园,你知道,人们给你免费三明治。他们。早上好,警官,你知道,一切都很好。现在,当你,当你冒充警察时,你可能会有点紧张。你会有点害怕,也许你会说一些可能让,你知道,有人说,什么,为什么警察会说这个?你有点紧张,当然,因为你在冒充警官。但如果在远处朝你走来,你看到一个真正的警察。你现在不只是紧张。你害怕。为什么?因为真正的警察肯定会揭露你是冒充者。

会发生的。因此,根据保罗的说法,所有人类,我们想做主。我们想成为自己的老板。我们想控制自己的生活。我们想要功劳。

所以那是宇宙剽窃。我们想为我们是谁和我们做了什么而邀功。我们想拍拍自己的背,在所有那些方面。我们在做什么?我们在冒充神。我们在冒充创造者。你知道,我们是自力更生的人,我们在敬拜我们的创造者。但发生了什么?你看,当有人来说,我相信一位神,他造了世界,现在他在远处,他很遥远,或者有人说,我相信自然,一位就是自然的神,我相信这个,我相信。有很多神实际上不会威胁你。

但当你接触到创造你、维持你的圣经的神,祂是荣耀的神,你欠祂一切,那是一位会让你抓狂的神。你会崩溃。那就像当你冒充警察,你看到一个真正的警察走来,你在冒充神。当你看到真正的神来临,圣经的神来临,你会发疯。保罗说,这就是为什么即使我们知道有神,实际上,在某些方面,我们像有神一样生活。

我们对自己诚实。我们不能不知道有神。祂的实在性一直向我们压来。同时,我们拼命不想相信神。这个房间里的每个人,包括现在在麦克风后面的这个人,在某种程度上压制真理。

我们没有人能承受神完全的实在性。太威胁了。太创伤性了。我们都试图以某种方式削减神,使祂扁平化。但圣经的神,非常创伤性。

所以虽然我们可以知道神,我们确实知道神,我们不知道神。嗯,我们能做什么?我们能做什么?嗯,这里实际上有线索,关于我们能做什么以及我们如何能真正认识真正存在的神,我们如何能治愈我们的恐惧,以便我们能真正认识祂。那是什么?

嗯,让我这样说。这在某些方面涉及罗马书的其余部分,我们不是在看整本罗马书。但让我告诉你,让我们回到19、20节一分钟,说,如果你看自然,他说,如果你看创造,如果你看被造之物,你能学到关于神的什么?祂是不可见的。祂是永恒的。

祂是有能力的。祂是神圣的。好的。列表中缺少什么?有什么是说你不能仅仅通过看自然就知道关于神的吗,仅仅使用你的理性,仅仅使用你所有的理性能力,试图客观?

无论你多么努力,看着被造之物,有一件事你不会知道任何东西。那是什么?关于祂的爱或祂的恩典有什么吗?那可能是真的。让我们来看自然课。让我们从地质学角度看。哦,看火山。看地震。你只是看那个,就说,我只是看到神是爱的神。不。

让我们从气象学角度看自然。飓风,你看,你知道,海啸。你只是看自然,说,你只是,我只是知道神是爱的神。让我们从天文学角度看。你知道,我们在一个星系中。我们的星系只是,你知道,数万亿英里宽。我们,有1000亿个我们甚至知道的星系,我们可能只知道实际有多少个的一小部分。你看那个,创造了这一切的神的想法,你只是看那个,说,哦,我只是真的想认识这样的神。不,你吓坏了。如果有一位神创造了这一切,我是什么?

让我们从生物学角度看。你知道,安妮·迪拉德写了一本伟大的书,《廷克溪的朝圣者》,多年前出去住,你知道,在弗吉尼亚的山里。她因这本书赢得了普利策奖,她说,我想观察自然。所以她在小溪边观察。她观察自然。

她以为那会让她亲近自然,她看到自然有多暴力。她看到一只巨大的水虫蜇并麻痹了一只青蛙,然后把它的东西放进它的大脑里,吸出它的大脑,直到它像一件没有人在里面的衣服一样坍塌。她说,哦,自然。你看自然,血腥和牙齿爪子,说,哦,我只是知道神是爱的神。不,你不会发现神是爱的神。

事实上,现在这有点更有争议性。我要花20秒说这个。我保证我能支持它,但我只是告诉你,你看其他宗教吗?然后说,嗯,其他宗教都说神是爱的神。不,你去佛教。他们谈论如果你是佛教徒要有慈悲。当然,但那是因为这个世界是不真实的,你不应该抓住任何东西。这个想法是神是一个非人格的灵魂,我们将成为非人格的灵魂。不,他们不相信神是爱的神。事实上,如果你跟伊斯兰教谈,你说,你相信你的神是爱的神吗?

他们会谈论仁慈,但我和许多许多穆斯林交谈过,神是爱的神吗。他们说,不,我们不会那么说。那么你从哪里得到神是爱的神这个想法?它在世界上如此普遍。我告诉你你从哪里得到这个想法。

它来自圣经。那是人类思想中唯一的来源。但如果你真的不只是从圣经中拉出你想要的,真正找到圣经的神,这是你看到的。第18节,忿怒。一位忿怒的神,一位对罪愤怒的神,一位对罪极其愤怒的神。

在罗马书第3章后面一点,它会说,罪的工价就是死。忿怒,要求死,因为我们不服从祂。然而,看,第16、17节,但我不以福音为耻。因为这是神的大能,要将救恩带给每一个相信的人。看,先是犹太人,好人,然后是外邦人,异教徒,无所谓。

因为在福音中,神的义显明出来。义不是赚来的,不是你发展的东西,而是作为礼物给予的。这是本于信,以致于信。你将因此而活。现在重点来了。

当你在爱中把自己给某人,当你进入一段爱的关系,你把自己在爱中给某人,你会失去控制吗?是的,你失去控制。你不能只是以任何方式生活。当你进入一段爱的关系,你失去控制。这很好。

这很好。为什么?因为对方也失去控制。你不是,如果这是真正的爱的关系,你们不互相剥削。如果你只是仰望天空说,我想相信一位爱的神,听着,那只是使神扁平化。一位爱的神。是的,你知道吗?你害怕失去控制。你和我害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说,我只是相信一位爱的神,祂不审判任何人,接受每个人就像他们现在的样子。

那是一位扁平的神,不会威胁你。他们不会揭露你在冒充的事实。但圣经的神,福音的神是这样的。祂是一位愤怒的神,因为祂对罪愤怒,然而耶稣基督,神的儿子,来到这个世界,去十字架,失去控制。完全控制。

每个人都对祂为所欲为。祂被殴打。祂是精神。祂被钉。祂失去完全控制。

为什么?祂承受我们应得的。祂承受那忿怒。祂承受那死亡。换句话说,神的儿子,道成肉身的神,如此爱我们,祂愿意失去控制。

这样祂就能重新承受我们的惩罚,这样祂就能宽恕我们,爱我们。现在,那是什么?那是一种不剥削的爱。你看,你可以把自己给这位神,因为祂为你上了十字架。你看,没有其他宗教有类似的东西。没有其他哲学有类似的东西。现在,最后,我有一位神,我可以把自己给祂。福音和爱的神和圣洁的神的福音,一位如此圣洁以至于必须惩罚罪的神,一位如此充满爱以至于会亲自承受惩罚的神。在那里你现在有了一位荣耀的神。你有了一位多维度的神,一位复杂的神,一位真正有位格的神。

一个我可以认识的人,也是一位我可以把自己给祂而不害怕的神。所以福音治愈了使我无法真正认识神的恐惧。它是独特的。我最喜欢的部分,事实上,在小说《少年Pi的奇幻漂流》中我唯一喜欢的部分,是这一个地方,我得读给你听。太棒了。

每隔几年,我得出来读给你听。这是男孩探索所有不同宗教的地方,他倾向于印度教,但后来他和一位天主教神父交谈,神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和祂在十字架上的死。这是男孩,他抓狂了,这是他说的。神会忍受逆境,我能理解。印度教的神面对他们应得的那份小偷、恶霸、绑匪和篡位者。《罗摩衍那》是什么,不就是罗摩漫长糟糕一天的记录吗?逆境?是的。命运逆转?是的,背叛,是的。

我的羞辱?死亡?我无法想象主克里希纳同意被剥光衣服、鞭打、嘲笑、拖过街道,最重要的是,被钉十字架,而且是在仅仅人类的手中。我从未听说过印度教神死亡,但神性不应该被死亡摧毁。那是错的。

这位基督教的神让祂的化身死是错的。那就等于让祂自己的一部分死。因为如果儿子要死,那不能是假的。如果十字架上的神是神在扮演人类悲剧,那就把基督的受难变成了基督的闹剧。儿子的死必须是真的,马丁神父向我保证那是真的。

但一旦是死的神,就永远是死的神,即使复活了,这个儿子口中必须永远有死亡的味道。三位一体必须被它玷污。神父右手边一定有某种臭味。恐怖必须是真的。神为什么要把那个加在自己身上?为什么不让死亡留给凡人?为什么要弄脏美丽的东西?为什么要毁坏完美的东西?爱?那是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的父,我们看到,通过扫视天空、使用我们的理性和理性论证,我们永远不会学到的,是神牺牲的爱。在耶稣基督里,主,除了在福音中,我们永远不会知道那个,但那是我们需要来治愈我们心的。所以我们对你的原始和深刻的内在认识,最终可以自由地释放。我们害怕你,主。我们害怕失去控制。你的实在性,你荣耀的实在性,对我们来说太创伤了,但只有在福音中我们才能被治愈,我们才能拥抱你,最终与我们的创造者、我们的造物主、我们的救赎主、我们被造来敬拜、爱和认识的那一位重新联合。哦,主。教导我们如何公开表达我们的信仰,我们这些理解福音并经历过那种治愈的人。教导我们在我们心中使用福音,这样我们就可以不断获得对你实在性更好、更荣耀的看法,因为即使现在,主,我们很多人,我们是信徒,但我们仍然没有完全掌握你是谁的伟大。我们有时仍然扭曲那个,父,教导我们如何公开表达我们的信仰,这样其他人就可以知道通过看到你儿子耶稣基督的福音、祂的爱而来的心的治愈,我们奉祂的名祷告。阿们。

今天的经文来自罗马书第1章第16至21节。我不以福音为耻，因为这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来，这义是本于信，以至于信，如经上所记："义人必因信得生。"原来，神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为神已经给他们显明。

自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但藉着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的道。我们正在进行一个系列的第四周，这个系列叫做"公共信仰——分享内心的盼望"，每周在小组中我们都会讨论周日早晨在这里所谈论的内容。我们生活的社会并不鼓励人们公开表达自己的宗教信仰和宗教信念，这真是很讽刺，因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开表达其他一切事情。我们必须告诉别人我们是谁，但想想看。

没有什么比你的宗教信仰更能从根本上定义你的身份和你是谁了。因此，如果我们要建立一个真正开放和多元的社会，我们都必须学会如何公开表达我们是谁，表达我们最深层的信仰信念，同时以一种尊重他人、促进和平的方式来做到这一点。这就是我们在这些早晨信息和每周小组中所探讨的内容。本周，我们想谈谈如何谈论神以及神的存在？如果你要公开谈论信仰，就不能不谈论神的存在，但你如何做到这一点而不会

变成了一场激烈的争吵，就像这样。

上帝确实存在。不，上帝不存在。这就是互联网上的景象，对吧？有时候在街上也是如此。我认为让人们更加深思的一个方法是，不要问"上帝是否存在"这个问题，而是问"你怎么知道？你怎么知道上帝是否存在？"

你怎么认识上帝？或者如果你说你无法知道是否有上帝，你又是怎么知道这一点的？看，一旦你开始问这个问题——你怎么知道是否有上帝，或者你怎么知道你能否知道是否有上帝？这就会让事情慢下来，让人们多思考一些。而对于这个问题，没有比罗马书第一章，特别是罗马书第一章的这一部分更好、更巧妙、更精彩的答案了。

你怎么能知道是否有上帝？由圣保罗所写的罗马书第一章给出了最精彩的答案。我认为关于"我们如何知道是否有上帝"这个问题，没有比这里更精彩、更巧妙的答案了。因为保罗实际上几乎同时给了你四个答案，所以我们要一一来看。

就在这几节经文中，他是这么说的。他说，我们能够认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝。而且我们能够真正地认识上帝。

我们确实认识上帝。顺便说一句，我们同时又不认识上帝，而且有一种方法可以真正认识上帝。他在这里全都说了。让我们来看一看。首先，正如我所说的，他确实在这里说你能够知道有一位上帝。

例如，那些著名的经文，它们都很有名，19节和20节。"神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但藉着所造之物就可以晓得。"现在，他在说什么呢？他说，在所造之物中，也就是大自然、被造的世界，有上帝存在的线索，明显的线索。

他实际上是在说，从你在大自然中所看到的，可以推断出上帝的存在。现在，我用"线索"这个词的原因是，许多人有时候，我认为，错误地将这些线索称为"证据"。所以有些人说，通过观察大自然和观察世界，你可以证明

有上帝的存在。如果你上网查询,或者翻开任何哲学教科书,他们都会给你这些证明。而那些通过观察自然和受造秩序得出的证明,这些证明都有很长的名称。

如果你知道怎么说出这些名称,你会对自己感觉好多了。这真的有助于提升你的自尊。比如宇宙论证,还有目的论证。现在,保罗在这里并没有使用"证明"这个词。我认为那样理解是过度解读了。

证明是指任何理性的人都无法否认的东西。任何理性的人都找不到任何理由不相信它。我不认为保罗是这个意思。我认为他实际上是在说,如果我们的认知能力,我们的心智处于更好的状态,我们会更容易承认那些线索。但它们确实存在。

它们是什么呢?嗯,我宁愿,他没有告诉你太多。他只是说上帝的真实性,神性和祂的能力,都有线索可寻。我只花一分钟讲讲这两个论证,让你看看它们是如何运作的。但它们不是证明,而是线索。

宇宙论证是这样运作的。无中怎能生有?就是这样。比如,你知道,大爆炸理论,宇宙始于一场爆炸。虚无怎么能爆炸呢?

你知道,虚无是不能爆炸的。那么这场爆炸怎么能从虚无中产生呢?有人会说,嗯,并不是什么都没有。是有东西的。好吧,但那个东西从哪里来的?

当你不断问这个问题的时候,那个东西从哪里来?它来自那个,那个东西又从哪里来?如果你一直追溯回去说,嗯,有某个东西是没有原因的,它不是从虚无中产生的,它一直就在那里,而我们知道在这个世界上没有这样的东西。我们所知道的一切都有开始。我们所知道的一切都是有原因的结果。

一旦你开始谈论无因之因,一旦你开始谈论某个没有,一直就存在的东西,你就是在谈论超自然的东西。也就是说,某个我们在自然界不知道的东西,某个超越自然的东西,

某种神圣的存在。看,这就是宇宙论证的论证方式。它说,这一切怎么可能从虚无中来?如果它不是从虚无中来的,那是什么创造了它?

目的论证实际上也很有趣。同样,我看着我的手表。它们确实很有趣。如果它们不足以让人相信上帝,它们确实没有做到。但线索就在那里。

目的论证来自希腊词telos,意思是设计。它讨论的是世界被如此完美地设计,怎么可能是偶然形成的?现在物理学家会告诉你这一点,我必须看着我的笔记才能正确地说出来,宇宙的基本规律和常数,比如光速、引力常数、弱核力和强核力的强度,所有这些东西都必须完美地校准。这几乎就像有一百个刻度盘,每个刻度盘都必须恰好在正确的位置,一个都不能偏离一丝一毫。它们都必须如此完美地校准,以便物质能够凝聚,除非所有这些东西都恰好是现在的样子,我们不会有物质,我们不会有世界,我们不会有人类生命。

所以许多人说,太多的事情必须恰好以现在的方式发生,无论是人类生命,甚至是生命,甚至是物质,这不可能是偶然发生的。所以上帝创造了它。这就是目的论证。现在像理查德·道金斯或斯蒂芬·霍金这样的无神论者,花了很多时间反驳这个论证,你知道这意味着什么吗?这意味着它一定有说服力,否则他们不会花时间。

但你知道他们都说什么吗?道金斯说什么,你知道斯蒂芬·霍金说什么吗?他们说在大爆炸时,可能形成了无限数量的可能宇宙,而我们恰好在这个物质能够凝聚的宇宙中,在这个宇宙中,各种基本的物理规律和常数恰好是生命发生所需要的样子。所以我们就在这里。有无数个这样的宇宙,而我们只是

恰好处在这个一切都发生的宇宙中。

当然，许多哲学家对此有很多有趣的论述。我只给你们讲一个。约翰·莱斯利是一位哲学家，他给你讲了这样一个故事。约翰·莱斯利告诉你这个故事。他说，想象有一个人即将被处决。

于是这位中士找来50名神枪手，让他们在距离囚犯六英尺的地方排成一排。所以50名神枪手拿着步枪，距离囚犯六英尺，准备，瞄准，开火。结果他们全都没打中。中士问道，发生了什么事？每个人都说，天啊，中士，我的鼻子刚好抽动了一下，你知道的，眼睛里进了东西，你知道的，对不起，50个人同时都这样。

中士说，不可能50个人同时这样。然后有个上过哲学课的人说，但是中士，在大爆炸的时候，可能形成了无数个可能的宇宙。而我们恰好处在这个宇宙中，在这个宇宙里，50名神枪手恰好在同一时刻，你知道的，鼻子都抽动了一下。现在，你知道，首先，如果中士也上过哲学课，他必须说，你说得对，我无法证明这是一场阴谋。因为我们可能恰好处在这个唯一的宇宙中，对吧？

我无法证明，但我知道这是一场阴谋。我永远不会，在一百万年里，假设我们恰好处在这个一切都可能发生的唯一宇宙中是不合理的。我要你假设这是一场阴谋。是有人做的。是精心策划的，有某种个人行为，有某种个人设计参与其中，对吧？

他不会假设这个万亿分之一的概率恰好发生了。他会假设这是一个个人设计。而你说，有万亿分之一的可能也许没有上帝。把你的整个生命建立在这个假设上有意义吗？所以这些就是宇宙论和目的论的论证。

这些基本上就是人们多年来所看到的那些线索的形式。保罗说它们就在那里。它们确实是我们的线索。但保罗说的比这更激进。激进得多。

因为他不只是说通过观察有可能认识上帝

论本性。实际上他更进一步，远远超过那个程度，说每一个人实际上都知道神的存在。看到他说的了吗？他说神是愤怒的。为什么祂愤怒呢？

神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些压制真理的人。这是每个人，全人类，压制真理的人。什么真理？关于神可知的事。然后在第21节，他说，因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀祂。

他所说的是，人们，所有的人都在压制关于神存在的真理。现在，你不能压制你没有的东西。而他所说的是，在某个非常深的层面，每一个人都知道神在那里。顺便说一句，这对人们来说是一个非常冒犯性的陈述。事实上，就在昨天的报纸上，在昨天的《纽约时报》上，有一封致编辑的信。

这封致编辑的信是关于我碰巧错过的某篇专栏文章。但某位专栏作家在本周早些时候的一篇专栏文章中用了这样一个词，说"战壕里没有无神论者"。你听过这句话。就是说当枪声响起时，即使是无神论者也会显示出他们实际上相信神的存在，嗯，一位无神论者写信来表达他非常生气，这是他说的话。这是公平的。

他说，引用他的话，他说，暗示无神论者在内心深处都是有神论者，我们的信念是随意和肤浅地持有的，在逆境面前很容易被放弃，这简直不是真的。他说，他是一位无神论者。他说，说我在内心深处真的是一个有神论者，我的无神论，我的信念，我们的信念是随意和肤浅地持有的，很容易被放弃。这就不是真的。嗯，看，保罗并没有说任何类似的话。

保罗说的是这样的。是的，保罗说的是，在某个层面上每个人都知道有一位神。但正如我们马上要看到的，他也在说，在一个深刻的层面上，每个人，我们所有人都相信神，但又不相信神。有趣的是，翻译者们永远无法正确翻译这个，因为这是一个非常尴尬的结构。但保罗故意这样说，当他说，关于神可知的事，向他们显明。

因为自从创造世界以来，神那看不见的品质、永恒的权能，都已经清楚地显明出来，被人所领悟。这里的动词在希腊文中是现在被动分词。注释家们说，这意味着神的真实性不断地压在我们身上。也就是说，我们内心的一部分不相信神的存在，但另一部分却对祂的真实性敏感，而这个真实性不断地压在我们身上。所以保罗所描述的，是我们内心中否认神存在的那部分与对祂的真实性敏感的那部分之间，一场深刻而矛盾的对话。这绝不是什么随便或肤浅的事。

然而保罗在说，在某种程度上，在我们内心的某个部分，我们知道神在那里。现在你说，这有什么证据呢？看，我们这里谈论的不是，你可以看看神存在的论证并推断出祂的存在。我们说的是，保罗在说所有人已经知道祂的存在。在某种程度上，他们知道祂在那里。

那么，这有什么证据呢？多年来，我发现阅读从无神论者成为基督徒的人的传记很有意思。我看到了保罗所说的。有一大批杰出的英国知识分子，有些比其他人更有名，他们曾是无神论者后来成了基督徒。我是说，他们中有些更有名，比如艾略特（T.S. Eliot）、奥登（W.H. Auden），我看到一大批。有些不太有名，比如琼（C.E.M. Joad）、威尔逊（A.N. Wilson）。

这些人名字都有很多首字母缩写。但很多这些英国知识分子都是杰出的人物，他们是传记作家、文学批评家、思想家和诗人之类的。尽管他们成长过程中拒绝了基督教，成为了知识精英的一部分——那些嘲笑宗教和基督教的人，但他们以某种形式接受基督教，震惊了他们的同代人和同行。当我观察和研究他们时，我发现他们很少（如果有的话）会去看宇宙论论证和目的论论证这些证据，然后得出结论说，我

猜想有神存在。相反，当他们谈到如何找到信仰时，他们会说，他们意识到自己一直都相信神，他们一直在按照有神的方式生活。

他们没有承认自己在按照有神的方式生活，最终他们承认了祂必定存在。非常有意思。让我给你们举两个例子。一个不那么有趣，也不那么为人所知。A.N. 

Wilson，他是比较近期的人物。A.N. Wilson曾经是……凯茜，我知道他是因为他真的转而反对基督教，他写了一本可怕的C.S.路易斯传记，基本上攻击他的信仰。

他写过耶稣和保罗的传记，他对基督教非常怀疑，拒绝接受它，非常聪明的人，但在2009年复活节，他在报纸上发表了一篇文章说，我已经拥抱了基督教，震惊了所有人，并给出了复活节的见证。在文章中，他是这样说的，他说大多数公众声音——他指的是在英国。大多数公众声音都接受了这样的观念：只有愚蠢的人才真正相信基督教。事实上，唯物主义无神论不仅是一种贫瘠的信条，而且是完全非理性的。因为唯物主义无神论说，我们只是一堆化学物质。

它完全无法回答这个问题：如果我们只是有生命的肉块，我们怎么可能有爱或英雄主义或诗歌呢。他继续说，他说，那些相信没有神的人，相信我们只是……他称我们为，我们只是一袋袋化学物质，是进化而来的有生命的肉块。然后我们说我们需要高尚，我们需要相信正义，我们需要彼此相爱，他说这没有任何基础。现在你说这从何而来？让我给你们举第二个案例研究，因为它更清晰、更引人入胜。

W.H. 奥登，一位诗人，被认为是20世纪最杰出的作家之一。对我来说有趣的是，他的皈依就发生在多年前的上东区这里。他是英国人，但二战期间住在美国，他曾拥抱无神论，就像他那个知识阶层的所有人一样。但这显然开始于当他

是……你知道上东区的北部，大概是上东区的东北部，约克维尔在二战期间以及三四十年代是一个非常非常德国化的地方。

有非常非常多的德国人住在这里。而且有很多……实际上，当我们来到这里建立教会的时候，在八十年代末的上东区仍然有很多很多讲德语的教会、餐馆和类似的地方，后来基本上都消失了。但在四十年代，W.H.奥登去……他当时在学德语，那里有一些德国电影院，放映德国电影的地方。他在三十年代末的某个时候走进了一家电影院，看到了一部显然受到纳粹主义影响的电影，他看到……他看到美国犹太人……

德国人，美国……德裔美国人，这些生活在美国的德国人，对着银幕上出现在这个故事里的犹太人大喊侮辱性的话。这震撼了他。最终，这就是他所写的。他回归了基督教，震惊了所有人，这是他写下的东西。

让我为你铺垫一下，因为这非常重要。奥登认为所有受过教育和开化的人都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严。基本上相信所有受过教育的人，所有有文化的人，你知道，所有理性的人，那些相信人类理性重要性并且有文化修养的人，都会相信自由、理性、民主和人的尊严这些价值观。但发生的事情是，德国拥抱了纳粹主义，而德国作为一个成熟、受过良好教育的社会是首屈一指的——拥有卓越的科学、卓越的音乐、卓越的艺术、学术成就。你知道德国是首屈一指的，然而他们却拥抱了这样的思想：你应该……嗯，爱邻舍、公正和人权是虚构的。

所以这是奥登写的。这给他造成了一场危机，这是他写的。如果我确信那些受过高等教育的纳粹是错的，而我们这些受过高等教育的英国人是对的，那么是什么验证了我们的价值观而使他们的价值观无效呢？现在向天哭诉邪恶的英国知识分子

化身为希特勒的却没有天堂可以哀求。自由主义思想的整个趋势一直是在削弱对绝对真理的信仰。

人们试图让理性成为审判者。但我们要么服从无条件的绝对真理，要么就会有某个希特勒式的怪物提供一个基于理性的铁腕传统来作恶。这就是他的意思。他说他相信人权、自由和自由。为什么？

你为什么要相信人权和自由？为什么？特别是，让我们用你的理性，嗯？让我们看看自然。但当你观察自然时，你看到了什么，理性观察自然。

这是科学和经验主义的。你看到了什么？你看到强者吃弱者。这就是自然。这就是你如何来到这里的。

强者吃弱者。那么现在，你凭什么说一个强国吃掉一个弱国，或者一个强大的种族吃掉一个较弱的种族，你知道，摧毁压迫的标记，你凭什么说这是错的？什么理由？看，你只是在使用你的理性，不是道德，不是天堂，不是道德的缺席，只是你的理性。你如何决定人类的自由和尊严、人权和对所有人的正义？

当这不是自然运作的方式时，为什么要相信这些？他说希特勒在使用理性。而理性是，嘿，我们是进化的产物。所以基本上他是这样说的。是的。

当然，没有上帝，你可以有道德感受。哦，大家仔细听。没有上帝，你可以有道德感受。当然。你可以感觉到压迫人是错误的。

你可以感觉到人权是对的，好吗？但没有上帝，就不能有道德义务。也就是说，你没有权利说你的道德感受应该决定他们的行为。看，你有道德感受，你是英国人，他们有道德感受，他们是纳粹和德国人。你怎么敢说你的道德感受是对的，而他们的是错的？

当没有标准的时候。因此，这是他的决定，如果你相信人权和正义不是想象的价值，而是真实的。如果没有上帝，它们就会是想象的，但它们不是想象的。因此，必定有一位上帝。没有上帝，可以有道德感受，但不能有道德义务。

你不能说你

必须遵循我的道德感受。但如果你相信，种族灭绝是错误的。压迫是错误的。人权是对的。它们不仅仅是我的感受。

它们是对的。那么一定有一位上帝。奥登意识到他一直都相信上帝。他只是没有对自己诚实。我们知道有一位上帝。

在内心深处。我们压抑它。但这就是第三点。你看，保罗对人类处境的分析如此精辟的另一点是。我们能够认识上帝。

而且我们确实知道有一位上帝。然而，我们又不知道有一位上帝。你看，当他说的那一刻，我们确实认识上帝。他同时也说，我们压抑它。我们抑制它。

所以我们不知道它。然而我们又知道它。然而我们又不知道它。而且两者在根本上是相同的。我的意思是，它们同样强烈。

现在，我们现代人知道什么样的东西？我们倾向于压抑或抑制。你为什么要压抑某些东西？你为什么要抑制某些东西？如果它是创伤性的。

现在，有时记忆可能是创伤性的。我最喜欢的阿加莎·克里斯蒂小说之一是《沉睡的谋杀案》。它讲述了一个年轻女子买了一栋房子。在房子里，她开始对她看到的一起谋杀案产生闪回。结果是，当她还是个小女孩时，她在房子里，她压抑了对一起谋杀案的记忆。

这就是这起谋杀案的运作方式。现在，事实是心理学家会告诉你，真正的创伤性压抑记忆可能并没有那么多。我的意思是，有很多关于它的小说，媒体上也有很多人谈论它。但现实是，有些记忆如此创伤以至于我们简单地压抑它们，这可能不是真的。

这相当罕见。但我会告诉你，你确实会压抑什么。如果你真的很生气，你可以压抑它。不，我没有那么生气。如果你对自己所做的事情真的感到内疚，你可以压抑它。

不，我并不真的感到内疚。任何关于你内心的事情，如果不符合你的身份认同，不符合你想要认为自己是谁的方式。所以你有一个选定的身份。我喜欢把自己想成这样或那样或这样。当数据进来时，你所做的事情或你所拥有的感受，如果不符合

那些数据，你会筛选掉它，你会压制它，你会抑制它。

保罗说这正是我们对上帝所做的事。为什么？因为对上帝的认识是极其创伤性的。所以经文在这里，第21节，关键经文。尽管他们认识上帝，他们却没有荣耀上帝。

荣耀是什么意思？他们没有按照上帝真正的伟大和荣耀来对待祂，没有按照祂多维度的、伟大的、宏伟的本质来对待祂。为什么？因为他们不想感谢祂。现在你可能会说，什么？

这就是大罪。这就是整个问题所在。我们不想感谢上帝。是的。顺便说一下，即使在法律层面，有一种叫做抄袭的东西。

什么是抄袭？拒绝感谢某人，拒绝为你盗用的知识产权感谢某人，拒绝说，我想承认我从某处得到了所有这些想法。我们不说这些。为什么？因为那样我们就显示了我们的依赖性，显示了我们的义务，显示了我们可能实际上无法完全控制我们所说的话。但你看，如果有一位上帝，那么我们就完全依赖于祂。

我们对祂负有全部责任。看，如果有一位创造了我们并每一秒都让我们活着的上帝，那么这是创伤性的，因为这意味着我们需要为每一件事感谢祂，这意味着在你生命中没有一个地方是你不欠祂忠诚的。而我们憎恨这一点。因为我们对自己的形象是我们可以做主。我们是自己的主人。

我们决定什么是对或错，特别是我们的西方文化告诉我们这一点。然后圣经的上帝就出现了。没有比圣经的上帝更具创伤性的上帝了。为什么？嗯，看，如果你说，好吧，我相信一位爱的上帝，只是一位无处不在的爱的灵。

看，那根本不会妨碍你。你不必感谢那个人，对吧？那不是一个人。你仍然在掌控之中。你仍然可以活在你掌管自己生命的幻觉中。

或者如果你相信其他类型的神，我只是相信上帝是生命的力量和一切事物。有各种各样相信上帝的方式是创伤性的，而我们拥抱这些方式，但圣经的上帝

圣经，或者这样说。想象一下你有一个非常棒的骗局。在纽约市有一个社区，你去那里并打扮成警察。你冒充警察。

当你去那里的时候，人们把车停在路边，你知道，人们给你免费的三明治，他们说，早上好，警官，你知道，一切都进行得非常顺利。现在，当你在冒充警察的时候，你可能会有点紧张。你会有点害怕，也许你会说些什么可能会让某人说，什么，警察为什么要这样说？你当然会有点紧张，因为你在冒充警察。

但如果在远处，你看到一个真正的警察向你走来，会怎么样呢？你现在不只是紧张了。你会害怕。为什么？因为真正的警察肯定会揭穿你是个冒充者。

这是必然会发生的。因此，根据保罗的说法，所有人类，我们都想发号施令。我们想成为自己的老板。我们想掌控自己的生活。我们想要功劳。

所以这是宇宙性的剽窃。我们想要为我们是谁、我们做了什么而邀功。我们想在所有这些方面拍拍自己的后背。我们在做什么？我们在冒充神。

我们在冒充创造者。你知道，我们是自我造就的人，我们在敬拜我们的创造者。但会发生什么呢？看，当有人过来说，我相信一个创造了世界然后就离开的神，他很遥远，或者有人说，我相信大自然，一个与自然合一的神，我相信这个，我相信。有很多神实际上并不会威胁到你。

但当你遇到圣经中的神——他创造了你并维系着你，他是一位荣耀的神，你欠他一切——那是一位会让你吓坏的神。你会崩溃。这就像当你冒充警察时看到一个真正的警察走过来，你在冒充神。而当你看到真正的神——圣经中的神——走来时，你会发疯。保罗说，这就是为什么即使我们知道有一位神，我们

事实上，在某些方面，就好像有一位神存在一样地生活。

如果我们对自己诚实，我们无法不知道有一位神。他的真实性一直在向我们施压。与此同时，我们又极其不想相信神。在这个房间里的每个人，包括现在拿着麦克风的这个人，都在某种程度上压制着真理。

我们没有人能够承受神的全部真实。这太具威胁性了。这太创伤性了。我们都试图以某种方式削减神，将他扁平化。但圣经中的神，非常具有创伤性。

因此，虽然我们能够认识神，我们也确实认识神，但我们又不认识神。那么，我们该怎么办呢？我们能做什么呢？其实这里有一些线索，告诉我们可以做什么，以及我们如何能够真正认识那位真实存在的神，我们如何能够治愈我们的恐惧，从而能够真正地认识他。那是什么呢？

好吧，让我这样说。这在某些方面涉及到罗马书的其余部分，我们不会查看整卷罗马书。但让我给你们看，让我们回到第19-20节，如果你观察自然界，他说，如果你观察受造物，如果你观察那些被造之物，你能了解到神的什么？他是不可见的。他是永恒的。

他是大有能力的。他是神圣的。好的。清单上缺少了什么？仅仅通过观察自然界，仅仅通过使用你的理性，仅仅通过使用你所有的理性力量，通过试图保持客观，有什么是你无法知道关于神的事情吗？

无论你多么努力地尝试，观察那些被造之物，有一件事你无法了解任何信息。那是什么？关于他的爱或他的恩典有什么信息吗？这可能是真的。让我们来看看自然课。

让我们从地质学上来看。哦，看看火山。看看地震。你只是看着这些，然后就说，我看到神是一位慈爱的神吗？不会的。

让我们从气象学上来看自然界。飓风，你知道，海啸。你只是看着自然界然后说，你只是，我就知道神是一位慈爱的神吗？让我们从天文学上来看。你知道，我们在一个星系中。

我们的星系宽达亿万万英里。我们，而且

我们已知的就有一千亿个星系，而我们所知道的可能只是实际存在数量的冰山一角。当你看着这一切，想到有一位上帝创造了这一切，你会看着这一切说，哦，我真的很想认识这样一位上帝吗？不，你会被吓得要死。如果真有一位上帝创造了这一切，那我算什么？

让我们从生物学的角度来看。你知道，安妮·迪拉德写了一本很棒的书《廷克溪的朝圣者》，多年前她去弗吉尼亚的山区生活。她因这本书获得了普利策奖，她说，我想观察大自然。所以她在溪边观察。她观察大自然。

她以为这会让她接近大自然，但她看到了大自然有多么暴力。她看到一只巨大的水虫蜇伤并麻痹了一只青蛙，然后把它的器官伸进青蛙的大脑，吸出它的脑浆，直到青蛙像一件没有人穿的衣服一样瘪了下去。她说，哦，大自然。你看着大自然，血腥而残酷，你会说，哦，我就知道上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？不，你不会发现上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。

事实上，现在这个说法有点争议。我只花20秒谈谈。我保证我可以证明这一点，但我只想告诉你，你看看其他宗教？然后说，嗯，其他宗教都说上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。不，你去看佛教。

如果你是佛教徒，他们会谈论慈悲。当然，但那是因为这个世界是虚幻的，你不应该执着于任何事物。他们的观念是上帝是一个非人格的灵魂，而我们将成为非人格的灵魂。不，他们不相信上帝是一位慈爱的上帝。事实上，如果你跟伊斯兰教徒交谈，你说，你相信你的上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？

他们会谈论仁慈，但我跟许多许多穆斯林交谈过，上帝是一位慈爱的上帝吗？他们说，不，我们不会这么说。那么你从哪里得到上帝是一位慈爱的上帝这个观念呢？这个观念在世界上如此普遍。我告诉你从哪里得到的。

它来自圣经。那是人类思想中唯一的来源。但如果你真的不只是从圣经中抽取你想要的部分，而是真正找到圣经中的上帝，你会看到什么。第18节，

愤怒。一个发怒的神，一个对罪恶发怒的神，一个对罪恶极其愤怒的神。

在罗马书第三章稍后的部分，会说，罪的工价乃是死。愤怒，因为我们违背他而要求死亡。然而，看，16、17节，但我不以福音为耻。因为这是神的大能，要使一切相信的人得救。看，首先是犹太人，善良的人，然后是外邦人，异教徒，这都不重要。

因为在福音中，神的义显明出来。这义不是靠赚取的，不是你培养出来的，而是作为礼物赐给的。是本于信，以至于信。你将因此而活。现在重点来了。

当你在爱中把自己交给某个人时，当你进入一段爱的关系，并在爱中把自己交给某人时，你会失去控制吗？是的，你会失去控制。你不能想怎么活就怎么活。当你进入一段爱的关系时，你失去了控制。这很美好。

这很美好。为什么？因为另一个人也失去了控制。如果这是一段真正的爱的关系，你们不会彼此利用。如果你只是简单地仰望天空说，我想相信一位充满爱的神，听着，那只是把神扁平化了。

一位充满爱的神。是的，你知道吗？你害怕失去控制。你和我都害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说，我只相信一位不审判任何人、接纳每个人本来面目的充满爱的神。

那是一个扁平的神，不会威胁到你。他们不会揭露你在假装的事实。但圣经中的神，福音中的神是这样的。他是一位发怒的神，因为他对罪恶发怒，然而神的儿子耶稣基督来到这个世界，走上十字架，失去了控制。完全的控制。

每个人都对他为所欲为。他被殴打。他被羞辱。他被钉在十字架上。他失去了完全的控制。

为什么？他承受了我们应得的。他承受了那愤怒。他承受了那死亡。换句话说，神的儿子，道成肉身的神如此爱我们，以至于他愿意失去控制。

这样他就能承担我们的刑罚，这样他就能宽恕我们，爱我们。现在，这是什么？这是一种不利用人的爱。你看，你可以把自己交给

因为祂为你上了十字架，你可以来到这位神面前。你看，没有任何其他宗教有这样的东西。

没有任何其他哲学有这样的东西。现在，终于，我有了一位我可以把自己交托的神。福音，以及一位慈爱又圣洁的神的福音，一位如此圣洁以至于必须惩罚罪的神，一位如此慈爱以至于祂愿意亲自承受惩罚的神。现在你有了一位荣耀的神。你有了一位多维度的神，一位复杂的神，一位真正有位格的神。

一位我可以认识的神，也是一位我可以把自己交托而不必害怕的神。因此，那阻止我真正认识神的恐惧被福音医治了。这是独一无二的。我最喜欢的部分，事实上，在《少年Pi的奇幻漂流》这部小说中我唯一喜欢的部分，就是这一个地方，我得读给你们听。这太精彩了。

每隔几年，我就得拿出来读给你们听。这是那个男孩探索所有不同宗教的地方，他倾向于印度教，但后来他和一位天主教神父交谈，神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和祂在十字架上的死。男孩听了之后惊呆了，这是他说的话。神会忍受逆境，这我能理解。印度教的神明也遭遇过他们应得的盗贼、恶霸、绑匪和篡位者。

《罗摩衍那》不就是讲罗摩漫长而糟糕的一天吗？逆境？是的。命运逆转？是的，背叛，是的。

我的羞辱？死亡？我无法想象克里希纳神会同意被剥光衣服、被鞭打、被嘲笑、被拖着穿过街道，而且最重要的是，被钉十字架，而且还是在普通人类手中。我从未听说过印度教的神会死，但神性不应该被死亡玷污。那是错的。

这位基督教的神让祂的化身死去是错的。这等同于让祂自己的一部分死去。因为如果太阳要死，那不能是假的。如果十字架上的神是神在羞辱人类的悲剧，那就把基督的受难变成了基督的闹剧。太阳的死必须是真实的，马丁神父向我保证确实如此。

但一旦神死了，就永远是死过的神，即使复活了，这太阳的口中必定永远留有死亡的滋味。

三位一体必定会被它玷污。在父神的右边必定会有某种恶臭。这恐怖必定是真实的。为什么神会希望这发生在自己身上？

为什么不把死亡留给凡人呢？为什么要弄脏美丽的事物？为什么要糟蹋完美的事物？爱？这就是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的天父，我们看到，通过扫视诸天、运用我们的理性和理性论证，我们永远无法学到的，就是神牺牲的爱。在耶稣基督里，主啊，除了在福音中，我们永远无法知道这一点，但这正是我们医治内心所需要的。因此，我们对神、对你那原初的、深刻的、与生俱来的认识，终于可以自由地释放出来。主啊，我们害怕你。

我们害怕失去控制。你的真实，你荣耀的真实，对我们来说实在太创伤性了，但只有在福音中我们才能得到医治，才能拥抱你，最终与我们的创造者、我们的制造者、我们的救赎主、那位我们被造来敬拜、爱慕和认识的神重新联合。哦，主啊。教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，我们这些理解福音并经历过那种医治的人。教导我们在心中使用福音，这样我们就能不断获得对你真实性更美好、更荣耀的认识，因为即使现在，主啊，我们许多人，我们是信徒，但仍然没有完全把握你是谁的伟大。

我们有时仍然会扭曲这一点，父啊，求你教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，使其他人能够认识到通过看见你儿子耶稣基督的爱的福音而来的内心医治，我们奉祂的名祷告。阿们。
