### Introduction: Sharing Faith

How do we share what it means to truly know Jesus? Not just as a historical figure or moral teacher, but as Savior and King. This month, Tim Keller explores what the Bible shows us about being public with our faith and sharing the hope we have in Christ. The reading today is from the Book of Romans. Chapter 1 verses 16 through 21.

> For I am not ashamed of the Gospel because it is a power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. For in the Gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith, from first to last, just as it is written, the righteous will live by faith.

**The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the Godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.**

For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God, nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. This is the Word of the Lord.

### Knowing God: Romans 1

So we are again in a fourth week of a series we're doing called public faith, sharing the hope that's within, and each week in the small groups we're talking about what we are talking about here on a Sunday morning, and we don't live in a society that encourages people to be public about their religious faith and their religious beliefs, which is really ironic, because we are encouraged in our society to be public about everything else.

**We have to tell people who we are, but think about it. There's nothing more fundamental to your identity and who you are than your religious beliefs.**

### The Existence of God

Now, this week we want to talk about how do you talk about God and about God's existence? You're not going to be able to talk public about faith, you can't talk about God in this existence, but you go about that without getting into a shouting match and it goes like this. God does exist. No, God doesn't exist. That's the internet right there, you know?

And sometimes actually out on this street, I think one of the ways to make people more reflective is to not ask the question, does God exist, but how do you know? How do you know whether God exists? How do you know God? Or if you say you can't know whether it's a God or not, how do you know that?

**See, as soon as you start to ask the question, how do you know whether there's a God, or how do you know whether you can know whether there's a God? It just slows things down and makes people reflect a little bit more.**

And there is no better, more ingenious and brilliant answer to that question. How can you know whether there's a God or not, than Romans chapter 1, and this particular part of Romans chapter 1, written by St. Paul.

### Human Suppression of Truth

Paul actually gives you four answers, pretty much all at once, so we're going to look at them all. Just in these few verses, here's what he says. He says, we can know God. We do know God. We don't know God. And we can truly know God. We do know God. We don't know God all at once, by the way, and there's a way to truly know God. And he says it all right here. Let's take a look.

First of all, as I said, he does say here that you can know that there's a God. So for example, the famous verses, they're all famous, 19 and 20. What may be known about God is plain, for since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities as eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made.

Now, what's he saying here? He says, in what has been made, that's nature, the created world. There are clues, plain clues, to God's existence. He's actually saying that it's possible to infer God's existence from what you see in nature.

### The Gospel's Healing Power

Now, the reason I use the word clues is many people have sometimes people have, I think, misnamed these clues as proofs. And so some people say by looking at nature and looking at the world, you can prove there's a God. And if you go online, or if you go to any philosophical textbook, they'll give you those proofs. And the proofs that come from looking at nature and the created order are proofs, they have these great big long names.

And once, if you know how to say them, then you feel so much better about yourself. It really helps your self-esteem. So there's the cosmological argument, and there's the teleological argument. Now, Paul doesn't use the term proof here. And I think that's reading too much in. A proof is something that no rational person can deny. No rational person can find any reasons not to believe it.

**And I don't think Paul's saying that. I think he's actually saying that if our cognitive faculties, of our hearts and minds were in better condition, we would acknowledge those clues more readily. But they're there.**

What are they? Well, I'd rather, he doesn't tell you much. He just says that God's reality is divine nature and His power are there's clues to it. I'll just go into the two for a minute, just to show you how it works. But they're not proofs, but they're clues.

### Conclusion

When you give yourself to someone in love, when you get into a love relationship, and you give yourself to someone in love, do you lose control? Yeah, you lose control. You can't just live any way you want. When you get into a love relationship, you lose control. And it's great. It's great.

Why? Because the other person loses control, too. You're not, if it's a true love relationship, you don't exploit each other. And if you just simply look up at the sky and say, I want to believe in a God of love, listen, that just flattens God. A God of love. Yeah, you know what?

You are afraid of losing control. You and I are afraid of losing control. And if we just say, I just believe in a God of love who doesn't judge anybody and accepts everybody just the way they are. That's a flat God that won't threaten you. They won't show up the fact that you're impersonating.

But the biblical God, the God of the gospel is this. He is an angry God because he's angry at sin and yet Jesus Christ, son of God, comes in this world and goes to the cross and loses control. Total control. Everyone has his way with him. He's beaten. He's spirit. He's nailed. He loses complete control. Why? He takes what we deserve. He takes that wrath. He takes that death.

**In other words, the son of God, God incarnate loves us so much he was willing to lose control. So that he could restake our punishment so that he could then forgive us and love us.**

Now, what is that? That's a love that does not exploit. You see, you can give yourself to this God because he went to the cross for you. You see, there's no other religion has anything like that. No other philosophy has anything like that. And now, finally, I've got a God that I can give myself to.

The gospel and the gospel of a loving God and a holy God, a God who is so holy, he has to punish sin and a God who is so loving that he would take the punishment himself. There you've got now a glorious God. You've got a multi-dimensional God, a complex God, a real personal God. Someone I can know and also a God I can give myself to and not be afraid.

And so the fear that keeps me from really knowing God is healed by the gospel. It's unique. My favorite part, in fact, the only part in that novel, The Life of Pi that I like, is this one spot where I got to read it to you. It's just too great. Every couple of years, I got to get out and read to you.

It's a place where the boy who is exploring all the different religions and he was leaning toward Hinduism but then he talks to a Catholic priest and the priest starts to tell him about Jesus and his death on the cross. And here's what the boy he freaks out and this is what he says.

> That a God would put up with adversity, I could understand. The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies, kidnappers and usurpers. What is the Ramayana, but an account of one long, bad day for the Rama? Adversity? Yes. Reversals of fortune? Yes, treachery, yes. My humiliation? Death? I couldn't imagine Lord Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged through the streets and to top it off, crucified, and at the hands of mere humans to boot.

I'd never heard of a Hindu God dying, but divinity should not be blighted by death. That's wrong. It was wrong of this Christian God to let his avatar die. That is tantamount to letting a part of himself die. For if the sun is to die, it can't be fake. If God on the cross is God shaming a human tragedy, it turns the passion of Christ into the farce of Christ.

The death of the sun must be real, Father Martin assured me that it was. But once a dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected, this sun must have the taste of death for ever in his mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it. There must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon himself? Why not leave death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful? Why spoil what is perfect? Love? That was Father Martin's answer.

Let's pray. Our Father, we see that the thing we'll never ever learn by scanning the heavens and using our reason and our rational arguments is the sacrificial love of God. In Jesus Christ, Lord, we'll never know that except in the gospel, but that's what we need to heal our heart. So the primordial and deep innate knowledge we have of God is, of you, is finally free to be released. We're afraid of you, Lord.

We're afraid of losing control. Your reality, your glorious reality is just too traumatic for us, but only in the gospel can we be healed, can we embrace you and finally be reunited with our creator, or our maker, with our redeemer, with the one that we were built to worship and love and know. Oh, Lord.

Teach us how to be public about our faith, those of us who understand the gospel and have experienced that healing. Teach us to use the gospel in our hearts so that we can constantly get a better and more glorious view of your reality because even now, Lord, so many of us, we're believers and yet we still don't completely grasp the greatness of who you are.

We still sometimes distort that and Father teaches how to be public with our faith so others can know the healing of the heart that comes through seeing the gospel of the love of your Son, Jesus Christ, and His name we pray. Amen.

### 引言：分享信仰

我们如何分享真正认识耶稣的意义？不仅仅是作为一个历史人物或道德教师，而是作为救主和君王。本月，Tim Keller 探讨圣经向我们展示的关于公开信仰和分享我们在基督里的希望。今天的阅读来自《罗马书》。第一章第16至21节。

> 因为我不以福音为耻，这福音本是神的大能，要救一切相信的，先是犹太人，后是希腊人。因为神的义正在这福音上显明出来，这义是本于信，以至于信。如经上所记，义人必因信得生。

**神的忿怒从天上显明在一切不虔不义的人身上，就是那些行不义阻挡真理的人。因为神的事情，人所能知道的，原显明在人心里，因为神已经给他们显明。**

自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得，叫人无可推诿。因为他们虽然知道神，却不当作神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。这是主的话。

### 认识上帝：罗马书1章

所以我们又进入了一个系列的第四周，我们正在进行一个叫做公开信仰的系列，分享内心的希望，每周的小组中我们都在讨论我们在周日早晨所谈论的内容，而我们并不生活在一个鼓励人们公开他们的宗教信仰和宗教信念的社会中，这真的很讽刺，因为我们的社会鼓励我们公开其他一切。

**我们必须告诉人们我们是谁，但想想看。没有什么比你的宗教信仰更根本地定义你的身份和你是谁。**

### 上帝的存在

现在，这周我们想谈谈如何谈论上帝和上帝的存在？你不能公开谈论信仰，你不能谈论上帝的存在，但你可以这样做而不陷入争吵，它是这样的。上帝存在。没有，上帝不存在。那就是互联网，你知道吗？

有时实际上在这条街上，我认为让人们更反思的一种方法是不要问上帝是否存在的问题，而是你怎么知道？你怎么知道上帝是否存在？你怎么知道上帝？或者如果你说你不能知道是否有上帝，你怎么知道的？

**看，当你开始问这个问题时，你怎么知道是否有上帝，或者你怎么知道你能否知道是否有上帝？这只是让事情慢下来，让人们多反思一点。**

没有比罗马书第一章更好、更巧妙和聪明的答案了，这个问题的答案是，如何知道是否有上帝，而这部分罗马书第一章是圣保罗写的。

### 人类对真理的压制

保罗实际上给了你四个答案，几乎同时给出，所以我们要看它们。就在这几节经文中，他说，我们可以认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝。我们可以真正认识上帝。我们确实认识上帝。我们不认识上帝，同时，顺便说一下，有一种方法可以真正认识上帝。他在这里都说了。让我们看看。

首先，正如我所说，他确实在这里说你可以知道有上帝。例如，著名的经文，都是著名的，第19和20节。关于上帝所能知道的事情是显而易见的，因为自从造天地以来，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，虽是眼不能见，但借着所造之物就可以晓得。

现在，他在这里说什么？他说，在所造之物中，那就是自然，受造的世界。那里有线索，明显的线索，关于上帝的存在。他实际上是在说，从你在自然中看到的东西中推断出上帝的存在是可能的。

### 福音的医治力量

现在，我使用“线索”这个词的原因是，许多人有时会误称这些线索为证明。所以有些人说，通过观察自然和观察世界，你可以证明有上帝。如果你上网，或者去任何哲学教科书，他们会给你那些证明。那些来自观察自然和受造秩序的证明，它们有这些伟大的长名字。

一旦你知道怎么说它们，你就会感觉好多了。它真的有助于你的自尊。所以有宇宙论论证，还有目的论论证。现在，保罗没有在这里使用“证明”这个词。我认为这是过度解读。证明是没有理性的人可以否认的东西。没有理性的人可以找到任何不相信的理由。

**我不认为保罗是在说这个。我认为他实际上是在说，如果我们的认知能力，我们的心灵和思想的认知能力处于更好的状态，我们会更容易承认这些线索。但它们在那里。**

它们是什么？好吧，我宁愿，他没有告诉你太多。他只是说上帝的现实是神性和他的力量有线索。我只想进入这两个一分钟，只是为了展示它是如何工作的。但它们不是证明，而是线索。

### 结论

当你把自己交给某人去爱，当你进入一段爱的关系，并把自己交给某人去爱时，你会失去控制吗？是的，你会失去控制。你不能随心所欲地生活。当你进入一段爱的关系时，你会失去控制。这是伟大的。这是伟大的。

为什么？因为另一个人也失去了控制。如果这是一段真正的爱的关系，你们不会互相利用。如果你只是简单地仰望天空说，我想相信一个爱的上帝，听着，那只是扁平化了上帝。一个爱的上帝。是的，你知道吗？

你害怕失去控制。你和我都害怕失去控制。如果我们只是说，我只是相信一个不审判任何人并接受每个人的爱的上帝。那是一个不会威胁你的扁平化的上帝。他们不会揭露你在冒充。

但福音的上帝，福音的上帝是这样的。他是一个愤怒的上帝，因为他对罪愤怒，但耶稣基督，上帝的儿子，来到这个世界，走上十字架，失去控制。完全失去控制。每个人都对他为所欲为。他被打。他被刺。他被钉。他完全失去控制。为什么？他承担我们应得的。他承担那愤怒。他承担那死亡。

**换句话说，上帝的儿子，道成肉身的上帝如此爱我们，他愿意失去控制。这样他就可以承担我们的惩罚，以便他可以原谅我们并爱我们。**

那是什么？那是一种不利用的爱。你看，你可以把自己交给这个上帝，因为他为你走上了十字架。你看，没有其他宗教有这样的东西。没有其他哲学有这样的东西。现在，终于，我有一个可以把自己交给的上帝。

福音和福音的上帝是一个爱的上帝和一个圣洁的上帝，一个如此圣洁的上帝，他必须惩罚罪，一个如此爱的上帝，他愿意自己承担惩罚。现在你有一个荣耀的上帝。你有一个多维的上帝，一个复杂的上帝，一个真实的个人上帝。一个我可以认识的上帝，也是一个我可以把自己交给而不害怕的上帝。

所以，阻止我真正认识上帝的恐惧被福音治愈了。这是独特的。我最喜欢的部分，实际上是我在《少年派的奇幻漂流》中唯一喜欢的部分，是这个地方，我必须读给你听。它太棒了。每隔几年，我就得拿出来读给你听。

这是一个男孩探索所有不同的宗教，他倾向于印度教，但后来他和一个天主教神父交谈，神父开始告诉他关于耶稣和他在十字架上的死亡。男孩惊慌失措，这是他说的。

> 一个上帝会忍受逆境，我可以理解。印度教的神面对他们的公平份额的小偷、恶霸、绑架者和篡位者。《罗摩衍那》是什么，只是罗摩的一天糟糕的一天吗？逆境？是的。命运的逆转？是的，背叛，是的。我的屈辱？死亡？我无法想象克里希纳勋爵同意被剥光、鞭打、嘲笑、拖过街道，更不用说被钉十字架了，而且是在仅仅是人类的手中。

我从未听说过一个印度教的神会死，但神性不应该被死亡玷污。这是错误的。这个基督教的上帝让他的化身死去是错误的。这相当于让他的一部分死去。因为如果太阳要死，那不能是假的。如果十字架上的上帝是上帝羞辱人类悲剧，那就把基督的受难变成基督的闹剧。

太阳的死亡必须是真实的，马丁神父向我保证它是。但一旦一个死去的上帝，总是一个死去的上帝，即使复活，这个太阳必须永远在他的嘴里有死亡的味道。三位一体必须被它污染。上帝父的右手一定有某种臭味。恐怖必须是真实的。为什么上帝要把这种事加在自己身上？为什么不把死亡留给凡人？为什么要弄脏美丽的东西？为什么要破坏完美的东西？爱？那是马丁神父的答案。

让我们祷告。我们的父，我们看到我们永远不会通过扫描天空和使用我们的理性和理性论证学到的东西是上帝的牺牲之爱。在耶稣基督里，主，我们永远不会知道，除非在福音中，但那是我们需要治愈我们心灵的东西。所以我们对上帝的原始和深刻的内在知识，终于可以被释放。我们害怕你，主。

我们害怕失去控制。你的现实，你的荣耀现实对我们来说太过创伤，但只有在福音中我们才能被治愈，才能拥抱你，最终与我们的创造者、我们的制造者、我们的救赎者、我们被建造来崇拜、爱和认识的那一位重新团聚。哦，主。

教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，那些理解福音并经历过那种医治的人。教导我们在心中使用福音，以便我们可以不断获得更好和更荣耀的对你现实的看法，因为即使现在，主，我们中的许多人，我们是信徒，但我们仍然没有完全掌握你的伟大。

我们有时仍然扭曲这一点，父亲教导我们如何公开我们的信仰，以便其他人可以通过看到你儿子耶稣基督的福音和他的爱的福音而知道心灵的医治。奉他的名祷告。阿门。
